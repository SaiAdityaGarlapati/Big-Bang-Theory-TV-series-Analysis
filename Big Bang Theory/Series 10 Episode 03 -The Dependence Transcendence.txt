b'Scene: The new laboratory.\nHoward: It\xe2\x80\x99s pretty late. You think I\xe2\x80\x99ve got time to run some more simulations on the cooling system?\nLeonard: Sure, I\xe2\x80\x99m still figuring out the thermo-acoustic expander.\nSheldon: Oh, while you do that I am going to pump cerebral spinal fluid through my brain cells to remove the metabolic by-products of the day\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts.\nHoward: What?\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s called sleep and it\xe2\x80\x99s my bedtime. Nighty-night, y\xe2\x80\x99all.\nHoward: Hey, hey, hey, you\xe2\x80\x99re not going anywhere.\nLeonard: We only have two months to deliver this to the Air Force because of you.\nSheldon: I know, I was there.\nHoward: Well, wake up, we\xe2\x80\x99re gonna put in a lot of late nights.\nSheldon: How late?\nHoward: Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, midnight, one.\nSheldon: One o\xe2\x80\x99clock? I\xe2\x80\x99m not a raccoon.\nHoward: If you\xe2\x80\x99re tired, have some coffee.\nSheldon: What? You have some coffee.\nHoward: I am having coffee.\nSheldon: And look how irritable it\xe2\x80\x99s making you!\nLeonard: Guys, we\xe2\x80\x99re not gonna get anything done if we start fighting. Now, can you please try\nto soldier through?\nSheldon: Fine. (Time passing montage) I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I can go much longer.\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s been three and a half minutes, wake up.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: I had a bad dream that my best friend became a tyrant and forced me to stay up all night to work.\nLeonard: Oh, I had a good dream that when I carried you to bed, I let your head hit the wall and I laughed.\nPenny: Good morning.\nLeonard: What is this?\nAmy: Well, we didn\xe2\x80\x99t see you last night, we\xe2\x80\x99re not gonna see you today, so we thought we could have breakfast together.\nLeonard: Oh, that is so nice.\nSheldon: Ow, it does hurt.\nLeonard: So, what are you guys gonna do today?\nAmy: Well, Sheldon was supposed to go to this party with me this afternoon, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x99s happening.\nSheldon: Oh, that was never happening.\nPenny: Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99ll go. I like a party.\nAmy: Well, to be honest, it\xe2\x80\x99s not like a party party, it\xe2\x80\x99s more like a gathering where scientists of different disciplines get together to share their work and keep current on what\xe2\x80\x99s going on in other fields. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why I called it a party, sorry.\nPenny: It\xe2\x80\x99s okay, I\xe2\x80\x99ll still go.\nLeonard: You don\xe2\x80\x99t think you\xe2\x80\x99ll be bored?\nPenny: Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99ll have some wine and listen to people go on about crap I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand. I mean, how is it any different than every single day of my life?\nSheldon: I won\xe2\x80\x99t be there.\nLeonard: : Look at that, it is a party.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s kitchen.\nHoward: Sorry I have to work all weekend.\nBernadette: It\xe2\x80\x99s okay.\nHoward: Thanks again for breakfast.\nRaj: Well, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t get to see you last night. It was the least I could do.\nBernadette: You shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have made the alarm code his birthday.\nRaj: So, what should we do today?\nBernadette: Oh, I appreciate it, but you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to spend your day off with me.\nRaj: Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind. Oh, you want go to the mall and look at baby stuff?\nBernadette: Not really.\nRaj: Oh, come on, we could share a pretzel and get sideways glances from racist old ladies.\nBernadette: I get enough of that when I take Howard to my grandmother\xe2\x80\x99s for Christmas.\nRaj: Oh, I know, why don\xe2\x80\x99t we get started on clearing out the baby\xe2\x80\x99s room?\nBernadette: Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it a little early for that?\nRaj: You have to get to it eventually.\nBernadette: Oh, there\xe2\x80\x99s so much junk in there, it\xe2\x80\x99s embarrassing.\nRaj: How can you be embarrassed around me? I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna be in the room with you when you give birth.\nBernadette: I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you are.\nRaj: You didn\xe2\x80\x99t think I was gonna be in your kitchen this morning, yet here I am.\nScene: In the university, Sheldon is asleep against a vending machine.\nVoice: Psst, hey, kid.\nSheldon: Huh, what?\nThe Flash (the voice): You look tired. Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you have an energy drink? Everyone\xe2\x80\x99s doing it.\nSheldon: Oh, no, thank you, those have caffeine in them.\nThe Flash: Oh sorry, I thought you were cool.\nSheldon: I am cool. This is Yoo-hoo, chocolate milk\xe2\x80\x99s delicious watery cousin.\nThe Flash: All right. But if you ever want to feel like you have superpowers, try one of these.\nSheldon: Superheroes take performance-enhancing chemicals?\nThe Flash: You bet. You know why Hulk is so strong? Steroids. You know why Batman wanders around at night getting into fights? Scotch.\nSheldon: I am facing a great deal of work. And I do like things better when famous people also like them.\nThe Flash: Here. It\xe2\x80\x99s on the house.\nSheldon: The first one\xe2\x80\x99s free? Flash, how do you stay in business?\nThe Flash: You want to know my secret? I bought stock in Marvel.\nScene: Bert\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nAmy: Hi, Bert. This is my friend, Penny.\nPenny: Hi.\nBert: Hey, come on in. I\xe2\x80\x99ll gonna go turn on some rock music. That\xe2\x80\x99s a geology joke.\nAmy: Bert\xe2\x80\x99s a geologist.\nBert: And a joker.\nPenny: How early are we?\nAmy: Oh, actually, we\xe2\x80\x99re an hour late.\nPenny: I suddenly wish Sheldon was here.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s spare room.\nBernadette: I don\xe2\x80\x99t even know where to begin.\nRaj: Well, in The Sound of Music, Julie Andrews says let\xe2\x80\x99s start at the very beginning, a very good place to start.\nBernadette: Oh, I was gonna start at the end. Thank God you\xe2\x80\x99re here.\nRaj: Well, I think the first thing we should get rid of is that tone.\nBernadette: Sorry. I should probably keep this in case we have a girl.\nRaj: Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s a nice one. Was it yours when you were little?\nBernadette: My dad built it for me.\nRaj: Wow, it\xe2\x80\x99s so cute.\nBernadette: This was the husband and this was the wife. They\xe2\x80\x99d go out on adventures together. Cruises, skiing, horseback riding. That was really me just duct taping them to our dog.\nRaj: Oh, and did they have kids?\nBernadette: They did, but the mommy and daddy didn\xe2\x80\x99t like them, so they shipped them off to an orphanage I made out of a shoebox.\nRaj: Yeah, that\xe2\x80\x99s not worrisome at all.\nBernadette: Not every girl dreams about being a mom. Sometimes you think you\xe2\x80\x99re never gonna have kids and one day you wake up and you\xe2\x80\x99re pregnant. And it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter that your career\xe2\x80\x99s going great right now and that you and your husband never even got to go anywhere taped to a dog.\nRaj: I skipped spin class for this.\nScene: The lab.\nHoward: Why is it taking him so long to get a drink out of a vending machine?\nLeonard: Oh, it\xe2\x80\x99s complicated. He finds pushing that little door and reaching up into the machine\nuncomfortably intimate.\nSheldon: Gentlemen, I am ready to work. To quote The Martian, let\xe2\x80\x99s science the faeces out of this. That\xe2\x80\x99s The Martian the book and The Martian the movie, not Marvin the Martian. Although to quote Marvin the Martian, I claim this planet in the name of Mars.\nLeonard: Are you okay?\nSheldon: Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m fantastic, never been better. I had my first energy drink and I feel great. Hey, you guys want to wrestle? We can do arm, thumb, mud, sumo. Nah, we\xe2\x80\x99re not fat enough, or wearing diapers.\nHoward: You wanted him awake.\nScene: Bert\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nPenny: So should we talk to each other or mingle?\nAmy: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know where everyone is.\nPenny: Yeah, I mean, I could see him eating one or two guests, but not a whole party.\nBert: Well, I guess this is kind of a bust. You don\xe2\x80\x99t have to stay. I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna start cleaning up.\nAmy: Okay. I feel so bad about leaving him here.\nPenny: Oh, it\xe2\x80\x99s funny, I was just thinking the same thing about you.\nBert: Hey, listen, could you not say anything about this to the people at the university? You know, \xe2\x80\x99cause you\xe2\x80\x99re you and I\xe2\x80\x99m me, and it\xe2\x80\x99s kind of embarrassing.\nPenny: Wait, what do you mean she\xe2\x80\x99s her?\nBert: Well, you know how Amy\xe2\x80\x99s the coolest girl on campus, right?\nPenny: No.\nAmy: No.\nBert: Oh yeah, everybody thinks so.\nPenny: What? You tell me about your foot fungus, but this is a secret?\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99m sure it\xe2\x80\x99s just \xe2\x80\x99cause I\xe2\x80\x99m dating Sheldon.\nBert: Mm, actually, I think Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s popular because he\xe2\x80\x99s dating you.\nPenny: Now Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s popular? What is happening?\nScene: The lab.\nHoward: Maybe we should break for lunch. What time is it?\nLeonard: According to the world\xe2\x80\x99s worst cuckoo clock, it\xe2\x80\x99s two.\nSheldon: My head hurts and I\xe2\x80\x99m more tired than ever.\nHoward: Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you just go home?\nSheldon: No, I can do this. I just, I just need another energy drink. Oh, no.\nLeonard: What?\nSheldon: I want another one.\nLeonard: So?\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s a craving. That\xe2\x80\x99s a sign of chemical dependency.\nLeonard: You only had one.\nSheldon: No, I know, but plenty of things are addictive after a single exposure. I mean, crack cocaine, nicotine, Pringles. You know once one pops one just can\xe2\x80\x99t stop.\nHoward: You can\xe2\x80\x99t develop a problem that fast.\nSheldon: You want to bet? Oh, great, now I\xe2\x80\x99m addicted to gambling.\nLeonard: We can\xe2\x80\x99t afford to lose any more time.\nHoward: Well, this probably won\xe2\x80\x99t work, but has anyone ever tried to just haul off and whup the crazy out of him?\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99s not helpful. It\xe2\x80\x99s fun to think about, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not helpful. Hey, Sheldon, we are on a serious time crunch. We can\xe2\x80\x99t do this without you. Can you please pull it together?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. Yes, of course.\nLeonard: Thank you.\nSheldon: Just, please, bear with me if I display symptoms of caffeine withdrawal.\nHoward: No worries.\nSheldon: You guys stink.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s kitchen.\nBernadette: Sorry I flipped out on you. I think it\xe2\x80\x99s just hormones.\nRaj: I think you were mean before you were pregnant, but it\xe2\x80\x99s fine. So, uh, instead of cleaning out the room, why don\xe2\x80\x99t we just decide on a theme for the nursery?\nBernadette: Does it really need one?\nRaj: Of course it does. Didn\xe2\x80\x99t your baby room have a theme?\nBernadette: Well, it doubled as my dad\xe2\x80\x99s office, and he was a cop, so I guess the theme was bloody homicide photos.\nRaj: Oh. Mine was Winnie the Pooh. But anyway, why don\xe2\x80\x99t we just take a step back and start with a colour? Right? There are so many amazing ones. Red, blue, green, purple.\nBernadette: Are you just gonna name all the colours?\nRaj: Well, not now.\nBernadette: I don\xe2\x80\x99t care what colour the room is.\nRaj: Okay, well, I\xe2\x80\x99m just trying to help you.\nBernadette: Well, you\xe2\x80\x99re not, so just drop it. (Off) I\xe2\x80\x99m clearly upset. Why aren\xe2\x80\x99t you following me?\nRaj: Sorry. Sorry.\nScene: Bert\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nBert: And when Amy started using a solution of chromic acid and white vinegar to clean all her lab equipment, all of a sudden, everybody was doing it.\nPenny: You trend setter.\nAmy: Just the right idea at the right time.\nPenny: Okay, okay, so Amy\xe2\x80\x99s cool, Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s cool. Tell me about Leonard.\nBert: Who?\nPenny: Leonard Hofstadter.\nBert: Oh, him. I guess he\xe2\x80\x99s all right. Apparently he tricked some hot girl into marrying him.\nPenny: That\xe2\x80\x99s me, I\xe2\x80\x99m her. You know, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t trick me, he just wore me down.\nBert: It makes sense you two are friends. I mean, hot girls always stick together.\nAmy: And you thought this wasn\xe2\x80\x99t gonna be a great party.\nPenny: You know, I had no idea Caltech is exactly like my high school.\nAmy: Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s not exactly like it. We\xe2\x80\x99re all extremely smart.\nPenny: Wow, you popular girls are mean.\nScene: The lab.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna get some coffee. You want some?\nSheldon: Uh, you\xe2\x80\x99re really going to have caffeine in front of me when I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to get my life back on track?\nLeonard: Uh, okay, let\xe2\x80\x99s pretend you do have a problem.\nSheldon: I do.\nLeonard: You don\xe2\x80\x99t.\nSheldon: Yeah, but I do.\nLeonard: No, you don\xe2\x80\x99t. But let\xe2\x80\x99s say you do. And don\xe2\x80\x99t say you do, because you don\xe2\x80\x99t. Now, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you think that throwing yourself into your work would be the best way to deal with it?\nSheldon: With what?\nLeonard: Your problem.\nSheldon: I thought I didn\xe2\x80\x99t have a problem.\nHoward: That was painful to watch.\nScene: Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s car.\nRaj: So where are we going?\nBernadette: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\nRaj: Okay. How Thelma and Louise of us.\nBernadette: Raj, why don\xe2\x80\x99t I care about anything?\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry?\nBernadette: It\xe2\x80\x99s my baby. I, I should care about nurseries and colours, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t. What\xe2\x80\x99s wrong with me?\nRaj: Well, crime-scene photos near your crib spring to mind.\nBernadette: I keep waiting to feel excited, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not happening. What if it never happens?\nRaj: Bernadette, come on, look, you\xe2\x80\x99re overthinking this, okay? You\xe2\x80\x99re gonna be an amazing mom. Even if you don\xe2\x80\x99t believe it, I know you have maternal instincts.\nBernadette: Once, I was supposed to babysit my brothers. Our neighbour found them naked in the backyard eating crickets.\nRaj: Happy and well-fed. You see, that\xe2\x80\x99s what I\xe2\x80\x99m taking from that story.\nScene: The lab.\nSheldon: Leonard, can I ask you a question?\nLeonard: Is it about the rotational symmetries you should be figuring out or your fake caffeine problem?\nSheldon: Howard, can I ask you a question?\nHoward: No.\nSheldon: All right, I\xe2\x80\x99ll just toss this out to the room. Um, I was thinking that the best way to fight my addiction is by weaning myself off in steps. Now, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t find a caffeine patch, but I did find what claims to be a mind-boosting caffeine suppository. You know, the interesting fact about the rectum\xe2\x80\xa6\nLeonard: Sheldon. We are dealing with an impossible deadline from the Air Force because of you. So have an energy drink, don\xe2\x80\x99t have an energy drink. Order suppositories and shove \xe2\x80\x99em wherever you want, I don\xe2\x80\x99t care.\nSheldon: You don\xe2\x80\x99t shove them. They come with an easy-glide applicator.\nLeonard: Right. Listen to me. We can\xe2\x80\x99t do anything until you do your part. So get up in front of this whiteboard and do it.\nSheldon: I can\xe2\x80\x99t.\nLeonard: Yes, you can.\nSheldon: No, I can\xe2\x80\x99t figure out the math. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been racking my brain for days, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve got nothing.\nLeonard: Seriously?\nSheldon: I can\xe2\x80\x99t do it. I\xe2\x80\x99m not as smart as I think I am. I\xe2\x80\x99m so sorry. This is all my fault.\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s okay, we\xe2\x80\x99ll figure something out.\nSheldon: But what if we can\xe2\x80\x99t?\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99ll be fine. You\xe2\x80\x99ll see. Sheldon? Buddy? (Sheldon snores)\nHoward: When the baby gets here, you gotta teach me that.\nBert\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nAmy: Thank you so much, Bert. This was great.\nBert: My pleasure. You girls want to take home a two-gallon tub of potato salad?\nAmy: I think we\xe2\x80\x99re good.\nBert: Okay, well, thanks for coming by. You\xe2\x80\x99re nice people.\nPenny: Well, so are you. In fact, you know what? We will never take you for granite. Did you get that? Granite? A little geology joke.\nBert: You need to leave. I\xe2\x80\x99m in love with both of you now.\nPenny: Okay.\nAmy: Bye.\nScene: Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s car.\nRaj: Uh, pull over.\nBernadette: What? Why? Who are you calling? You\xe2\x80\x99re gonna rat me out to Howard, aren\xe2\x80\x99t you? You\xe2\x80\x99re such a snitch, no wonder I don\xe2\x80\x99t like you.\nRaj: Whoa, I\xe2\x80\x99m calling my dad, okay? He\xe2\x80\x99s got experience dealing with pregnant ladies because he\xe2\x80\x99s an OBGYN. And experience with crazy ladies because of my mom.\nDr Koothrapalli (on facetime): Hello, Rajesh. Are you calling to ask for money?\nRaj: What? No.\nDr Koothrapalli: Are you calling to ask for things that cost money?\nRaj: No.\nDr Koothrapalli: Great. What\xe2\x80\x99s up?\nRaj: This is my friend, Bernadette. She\xe2\x80\x99s pregnant, and she\xe2\x80\x99s a bit worried, so I thought maybe you could talk to her.\nDr Koothrapalli: Of course. What seems to be the trouble?\nBernadette: Something\xe2\x80\x99s wrong. I don\xe2\x80\x99t care about any of the baby stuff every other mom is so into. Honestly, I\xe2\x80\x99m not even sure I like babies.\nDr Koothrapalli: Look, some people are baby people, and some people are not baby people. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean you won\xe2\x80\x99t love your own baby.\nBernadette: But I thought I\xe2\x80\x99d be more excited.\nDr Koothrapalli: Oh, being excited isn\xe2\x80\x99t a guarantee of anything. Rajesh\xe2\x80\x99s mother was thrilled when she was pregnant with him. After he was born, she doted on his every move. And you know what happened? He broke her heart, moved halfway around the world, and dates only poor white women. So you never know.\nBernadette: Thank you. I feel better now.\nRaj: Well I don\xe2\x80\x99t.\nDr Koothrapalli: Good. Bernadette, I hope you have a daughter.\nScene: Colonel Williams\xe2\x80\x99 office.\nLeonard: Um, I don\xe2\x80\x99t really know how to say this.\nColonel Williams: Well, you could try starting with sir.\nLeonard: Right. Sorry, sir.\nSheldon: He said start with it, not end with it.\nLeonard: Sir.\nColonel Williams: Hmm?\nHoward: We\xe2\x80\x99ve hit a bit of a snag. We\xe2\x80\x99re already behind schedule.\nSheldon: The computations required to overcome the deployability issues are more significant than we thought.\nLeonard: I understand that we\xe2\x80\x99re under contract, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what the consequences of violating that are, but, uh, we\xe2\x80\x99re not gonna be able to deliver in the time we promised.\nColonel Williams: How long do you need?\nHoward: We, we\xe2\x80\x99re thinking, two years.\nColonel Williams: All right.\nHoward: That\xe2\x80\x99s it? You\xe2\x80\x99re okay with that?\nColonel Williams: What, you think you\xe2\x80\x99re the first government contractor who isn\xe2\x80\x99t gonna deliver on time? We\xe2\x80\x99re still waiting for a big space laser Reagan ordered to beat the commies.\nLeonard: Thanks for understanding, sir.\nHoward: Yes, thank you so much.\nSheldon: We, we really appreciate it.\nLeonard (off): All right, pressure\xe2\x80\x99s off\nHoward (off): Wanna see a movie?\nSheldon (off): Popcorn\xe2\x80\x99s on me.\nAdvertisements'
