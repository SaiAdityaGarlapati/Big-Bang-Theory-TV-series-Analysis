b'Scene: The lobby.\nPenny: Oh, damn, they cancelled my Visa. Oh, yay, a new MasterCard!\nSheldon: Uh-oh.\nPenny: What?\nSheldon: I was going to get my mail.\nPenny: Okay. Are, are you hoping to get it telepathically?\nSheldon: I think you mean telekinetically. And no, I just wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure of the proper protocol now that you and Leonard are no longer having coitus.\nPenny: God, can we please just say no longer seeing each other?\nSheldon: Well, we could if it were true. But as you live in the same building, you see each other all the time. The variable which has changed is the coitus.\nPenny: Okay, here\xe2\x80\x99s the protocol, you and I are still friends, and you stop saying coitus.\nSheldon: Good, good. I\xe2\x80\x99m glad we\xe2\x80\x99re still friends.\nPenny: Really?\nSheldon: Oh, yes. It was a lot of work to accommodate you in my life. I\xe2\x80\x99d hate for that effort to have been in vain.\nPenny: Right.\nSheldon: Just to be clear do I have to stop saying coitus with everyone or just you?\nPenny: Everyone.\nSheldon: Harsh terms. But all right, I\xe2\x80\x99ll just substitute intercourse.\nPenny: Great.\nSheldon: Or fornication. Yeah. But that has judgmental overtones, so I\xe2\x80\x99ll hold that in reserve.\nPenny: So, how you been?\nSheldon: Well, my existence is a continuum, so I\xe2\x80\x99ve been what I am at each point in the implied time period.\nPenny: You\xe2\x80\x99re just coitusing with me, aren\xe2\x80\x99t you?\nSheldon: Bazinga.\nPenny: Mmm. How\xe2\x80\x99s Leonard doing?\nSheldon: He seems all right. Although he does spend a disturbing amount of time looking at photographs of you and smelling the pillow you slept on. Oh, but now that I think of it, he asked me not to tell you that.\nPenny: I\xe2\x80\x99ll pretend I didn\xe2\x80\x99t hear it.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99d rather you pretend I didn\xe2\x80\x99t say it. I see you bought Mama Italia marinara spaghetti sauce.\nPenny: Yep.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s the sauce my mother uses. She likes cooking Italian because according to her, that\xe2\x80\x99s what the Romans made Jesus eat.\nPenny: Interesting. I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to have you over for spaghetti some night.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m hungry now.\nPenny: Oh. Um, okay. Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you give me an hour and come over?\nSheldon: Will you cut up hot dogs into little chunks and mix them in with the sauce?\nPenny: I don\xe2\x80\x99t have hot dogs.\nSheldon: Oh, it\xe2\x80\x99s all right, I do. Oh! You\xe2\x80\x99re in for what my mother calls a real Eye-talian treat. (Enters apartment).\nLeonard: Hey, where you been?\nSheldon: I was talking with Penny.\nHoward: What\xe2\x80\x99s wrong with you? You can\xe2\x80\x99t hang out with your roommate\xe2\x80\x99s ex. That\xe2\x80\x99s totally uncool.\nLeonard: No, no, it\xe2\x80\x99s fine. I don\xe2\x80\x99t care. I\xe2\x80\x99m over it.\nRaj: Yeah, he\xe2\x80\x99s over it, that\xe2\x80\x99s why he\xe2\x80\x99s been whining all day about trying to invent that memory-wiper gizmo from Men in Black.\nSheldon: Is he making any progress? Because I\xe2\x80\x99d like to erase Ben Affleck as Daredevil.\nHoward: So would Ben Affleck. The point is, in a situation like this you got to pick sides. You\xe2\x80\x99re either on Team Leonard or Team Penny.\nSheldon: Which one picks last?\nHoward: What?\nSheldon: Well, usually I\xe2\x80\x99m on the team that picks last. Unless there\xe2\x80\x99s a kid in a wheelchair.\nLeonard: Sheldon, I got you your tangerine chicken. I hope you\xe2\x80\x99re hungry.\nSheldon: Well, of course I\xe2\x80\x99m hungry. And as I have no plans to eat with any other team, I will consume my tangerine chicken with the appropriate gusto. Mm, mm, mm!\nLeonard: Okay.\nSheldon: Just out of curiosity, do we still have hot dogs?\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Why?\nSheldon: Just making dinner conversation. Go, Team Leonard!\nCredits sequence\n  Scene: A few moments later.\nHoward: Oh, God, this is good.\nRaj: Let me ask you a question. Do you believe you\xe2\x80\x99re going to go to hell for eating sweet and sour pork?\nHoward: Jews don\xe2\x80\x99t have hell. We have acid reflux.\nLeonard: Do you want the last dumpling, Sheldon?\nSheldon: Certainly. It\xe2\x80\x99s not like I have to moderate my food intake because I\xe2\x80\x99m planning on eating again very shortly. Mm, mm, mm!\nLeonard: So, you guys want to do something tonight?\nHoward: Nah, I can\xe2\x80\x99t. I got to pick up my mom from her water aerobics class. 18 overweight women flapping their arm fat in a swimming pool. Looks like the manatee tank at Sea World.\nLeonard: What about you, Raj?\nRaj: Oh, there it is, now that you don\xe2\x80\x99t have a girlfriend, you want to hang out with me again.\nLeonard: I never stopped hanging out with you.\nRaj: Oh, please, we all know I\xe2\x80\x99m the friend you call when you have no other options. If we were the Justice League, I\xe2\x80\x99d be Aquaman.\nHoward: I wish you were Aquaman. Then I could send you to scoop my mom out of the old lady tank.\nSheldon: Excuse me, I\xe2\x80\x99m thirsty, so I\xe2\x80\x99m going to go to the refrigerator and get myself a refreshing beverage.\nLeonard: You know what? I\xe2\x80\x99ll just spend the evening alone.\nRaj: What, suddenly I\xe2\x80\x99m not good enough for you?\nSheldon: Ah, I do so love beverages. Now I think I\xe2\x80\x99ll take my after-dinner walk.\nLeonard: Since when do you take after-dinner walks?\nHoward: Yeah, since when do you take walks?\nSheldon: I read a study online that walking after a meal not only aids in digestion, but increases serotonin, and you know me, if there\xe2\x80\x99s one thing I like more than a refreshing beverage, it\xe2\x80\x99s serotonin. Bye-bye.\nHoward: Hold on. I\xe2\x80\x99ll walk down with you.\nSheldon: Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s not necessary. You can go first.\nHoward: Or we could go together.\nSheldon: I can\xe2\x80\x99t think of a reason why not.\nHoward: Let\xe2\x80\x99s go.\nSheldon: Hold on. Nope, no reason.\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99ve missed you.\nScene: The lobby.\nSheldon: All right, say hello to your mother for me.\nHoward: Okay.\nSheldon: What?\nHoward: You said you were going for a walk.\nSheldon: I didn\xe2\x80\x99t say outside.\nHoward: So what, you\xe2\x80\x99re just gonna walk up and down the stairs?\nSheldon: No, of course not. That would be odd and suspicious behavior.\nWoman\xe2\x80\x99s voice: Here Bubbles. Here boy.\nHoward: Which way are you going?\nSheldon: Which way are you going?\nHoward: I parked my scooter down the block.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m going the other way. Bye.\nHoward: Bye. Actually, I\xe2\x80\x99m this way. Do I smell hot dogs?\nSheldon: No. I mean, I have no idea what you smell.\nHoward: I definitely smell raw hot dog.\nSheldon: Perhaps you\xe2\x80\x99re getting a brain tumour.\nHoward: All right, have a nice walk.\nSheldon: I shall. Have a nice scoot.\nHoward: You might want to stand back. I\xe2\x80\x99m sitting on top of 13 horses here.\nSheldon: Oh. Hello, doggie. Nice doggie. I bet you think you smell hot dogs. Look, a cat!\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Penny, (knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Long pause, knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Penny opens door. A dishevelled Sheldon is holding up one hot dog.) Here. I had to trade the others for my life.\nScene: The apartment.\nRaj: Hey, Leonard?\nLeonard: Yeah?\nRaj: I haven\xe2\x80\x99t had sex in a year.\nLeonard: Where you going with this, Raj?\nRaj: Don\xe2\x80\x99t flatter yourself, dude. I want to go out and meet a woman.\nLeonard: So, go.\nRaj: Well, I need a wingman. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to come off like a lonely loser.\nLeonard: And you think my presence will help with that?\nRaj: Well, I do. Next to you, I\xe2\x80\x99ll look like a catch.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m not going out tonight, Raj.\nRaj: All right. Would you mind if I went to your room and downloaded some Asian pornography?\nLeonard: Very much.\nRaj: Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have to be Asian.\nLeonard: Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry. You\xe2\x80\x99ll meet a girl someday.\nRaj: No, I won\xe2\x80\x99t.\nLeonard: Yes, you will, and she\xe2\x80\x99ll be beautiful, and kind and sexy and funny and everything you ever wanted in a woman.\nRaj: You really think so?\nLeonard: I do, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll fall hopelessly in love and give her your heart. And she\xe2\x80\x99ll take it and grind it into pathetic, little pieces.\nRaj: But we\xe2\x80\x99ll have sex first, right?\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nSheldon: Mmm, mmm, mmm. That\xe2\x80\x99s Eye-talian.\nPenny: So, um, was Leonard okay with you coming over?\nSheldon: Oh, yes. In fact, he said, I\xe2\x80\x99m fine, I don\xe2\x80\x99t care. And he in no way said it in a manner which would lead one to believe that he was covering up feelings of anguish and betrayal.\nPenny: Well, good.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m also pleased to report that he\xe2\x80\x99s all cried out over you.\nPenny: He\xe2\x80\x99s been crying?\nSheldon: Oh, I believe that was something else I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t supposed to mention.\nPenny: Oh, God, I feel terrible.\nSheldon: Do you have a stomach ache, too?\nPenny: No. Why, do you?\nSheldon: No.\nPenny: Why did you ask if I had one, too?\nSheldon: Just making polite dinner conversation. Your turn.\nPenny: All right. So, what\xe2\x80\x99s new in your life?\nSheldon: Well, my new shoes are not made for running.\nPenny: Have you been running?\nSheldon: No. It\xe2\x80\x99s just a suspicion I have. Mmm, mmm, mmm.\nPenny: I\xe2\x80\x99m so glad you like it.\nSheldon: I do. Leonard never cooks for me.\nPenny: Well, maybe that\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x99cause Leonard can\xe2\x80\x99t cook.\nSheldon: You can\xe2\x80\x99t cook and you made me this.\nPenny: Whatever. Ooh, I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna get the cheesecake out of the fridge.\nSheldon: Oh, Lord, I\xe2\x80\x99m in Jewish hell.\nScene: The apartment.\nRaj: Look at this. Do you think she\xe2\x80\x99s really doing that or is it PhotoShop?\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m pretty sure Martha Stewart never got naked with a room full of big, fat Japanese guys.\nRaj: You don\xe2\x80\x99t know that. Prison changes people.\nLeonard: Hey, where you been?\nSheldon: I told you, walking.\nLeonard: For an hour and a half?\nSheldon: I got lost.\nLeonard: How could you get lost? Your phone has GPS.\nSheldon: Satellites are down. Solar flares.\nRaj: There are no solar flares right now.\nSheldon: Yes, there are.\nRaj: Dude, I\xe2\x80\x99m an astrophysicist. If there were solar flares, I\xe2\x80\x99d be all up in it.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. I misspoke. What I meant to say was my battery died.\nLeonard: What the hell was that about?\nRaj: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Do you think this is really Hillary Clinton doing it with Oprah?\nLeonard: Oh, we really need to get you a girl.\nScene: Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom. Leonard is asleep.\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard, (knock, knock, knock) Leonard, (knock, knock, knock) Leonard.\nLeonard: Oh, just come in!\nSheldon: Thanks for seeing me on such short notice.\nLeonard: What do you want, Sheldon?\nSheldon: Maybe this isn\xe2\x80\x99t a good time.\nLeonard: Tell me why you woke me up or I swear to God I will kill you.\nSheldon: Do you really think death threats are an appropriate way to begin this conversation? Sometimes your lack of social skills astonishes me.\nLeonard: What do you want?\nSheldon: You may want to sit down.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m in bed!\nSheldon: Point taken. You may want to sit up.\nLeonard: Sheldon!\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99ve been seeing Penny behind your back.\nLeonard: Okay, when you say seeing Penny, what exactly does that mean?\nSheldon: We had dinner last night. She made me spaghetti with little hot dogs cut up in it. Well, little hot dog. I gave up the other five hot dogs to a real dog. A real, big dog. A hell hound. Tangential to the primary story. How about I circle back to it?\nLeonard: Fine. Why did you have dinner with Penny?\nSheldon: I told you, she made spaghetti with little hot dogs. I like spaghetti with little hot dogs.\nLeonard: Then why did you have Chinese food with us?\nSheldon: I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to upset you. Howard made it very clear that my allegiance should be to male comrades before women who sell their bodies for money.\nLeonard: Is it possible he said Bros before Hos?\nSheldon: Yes, but I rephrased it to avoid offending the hos.\nLeonard: Sheldon, I don\xe2\x80\x99t care if you want to be friends with Penny.\nSheldon: Oh. Well, so the emotional turmoil that\xe2\x80\x99s been keeping me from achieving REM sleep was entirely unjustified?\nLeonard: Yes.\nSheldon: Well then as my meemaw would say, looks like we butchered a pig, but nobody wanted bacon.\nLeonard: I guess not.\nSheldon: And now, as promised, the tangent. Sheldon and the Hell Hound, or How I Lost My Hot Dogs.\nScene: The laundry room.\nPenny: Oh, um, I, I can come back.\nLeonard: D-don\xe2\x80\x99t be silly. We\xe2\x80\x99re neighbours, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to run into each other, may as well get used to it.\nPenny: Yeah, I guess you\xe2\x80\x99re right.\nLeonard: You used to it yet?\nPenny: Nope.\nLeonard: Me neither. Oh, Sheldon seemed think that I would be upset about you hanging out with him. But I just want you to know it\xe2\x80\x99s fine.\nPenny: Oh, oh, good, because, um, his mother called me.\nLeonard: His mother?\nPenny: Yeah, she wants me to take him shopping for sheets and towels.\nLeonard: I was going to do that.\nPenny: Oh, well, then you, you do it.\nLeonard: No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to do it. You can do it.\nPenny: Okay, you can take him for shoes.\nLeonard: I just took him for shoes.\nPenny: Well, all I know is he says they hurt his feet.\nLeonard: Fine. I\xe2\x80\x99ll take him for shoes next Saturday.\nPenny: Oh, no, no, no, a bunch of us from work are going to Disneyland next Saturday and Sheldon wants to come.\nLeonard: You\xe2\x80\x99re taking him to Disneyland?\nPenny: Well, he heard me making plans on the phone. Was I going to say no?\nLeonard: All right. But let me know if you\xe2\x80\x99re going to stuff him with junk food. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to bring home a nice dinner for him and see it go to waste.\nPenny: We\xe2\x80\x99re going to Disneyland. He\xe2\x80\x99s going to eat junk food.\nLeonard: All I\xe2\x80\x99m saying is give me a heads-up.\nPenny: Okay, whatever.\nLeonard: And don\xe2\x80\x99t let him go on Space Mountain after he eats. He\xe2\x80\x99ll say he can handle it, but I promise you\xe2\x80\x99ll end up with churro puke on your shoes.\nPenny: All right, got it. Is there anything else?\nLeonard: Yeah, don\xe2\x80\x99t let Goofy near him. He\xe2\x80\x99ll have nightmares and I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to deal with it.\nPenny: What\xe2\x80\x99s the problem with Goofy?\nLeonard: Wish I knew. He\xe2\x80\x99s fine with Pluto.\nScene: The apartment.\nRaj: Hey, do you think the elastic woman in The Incredibles needs to use birth control or can she just be a diaphragm?\nHoward: Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s it. We\xe2\x80\x99re officially out of things to talk about.\nPenny: We\xe2\x80\x99re home.\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock, where have you been?\nSheldon: We stayed for the California Adventure water show. It was pure Disney magic.\nLeonard: I was going to see that with him.\nPenny: How was I supposed to know that?\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s all right. I\xe2\x80\x99ll see it again with you.\nLeonard: And I have food here. You said you were going to call.\nPenny: I know, I know.\nSheldon: I can still eat.\nPenny: No, you already threw up once. Go put on your PJs and brush your teeth.\nSheldon: Okay, but just don\xe2\x80\x99t fight\nLeonard: We\xe2\x80\x99re not fighting.\nPenny: Just go.\nLeonard: Aren\xe2\x80\x99t you going to thank Penny for taking you to Disneyland?\nSheldon: Thank you, Penny.\nPenny: You\xe2\x80\x99re welcome, sweetie.\nLeonard: Want a cup of coffee?\nPenny: Oh, um, I should probably get going.\nLeonard: Come on. It\xe2\x80\x99s just a cup of coffee.\nPenny: Yep, okay.\nHoward (to Raj, who has whispered to him): Oh, yeah, the whole thing seems a little twisted to me, too.\nLeonard: What am I smelling?\nPenny: Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s churro on my shoes.\nScene: Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom.\nPenny: He\xe2\x80\x99s such an angel when he\xe2\x80\x99s asleep.\nLeonard: Yeah. Shame he has to wake up.\nPenny: I think we can do it.\nLeonard: Smother Sheldon in his sleep? Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t that be wrong?\nPenny: No, be friends. You and me.\nLeonard: Oh. Sure. Absolutely.\nPenny: Good. I\xe2\x80\x99m glad.\nLeonard: Here\xe2\x80\x99s an idea. I\xe2\x80\x99m just throwing it out there, friends who have sex.\nPenny: Good night, Leonard.\nLeonard: Kidding. Just a couple of friends goofin\xe2\x80\x99 around.\nSheldon (in his sleep): No, Goofy, no.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
