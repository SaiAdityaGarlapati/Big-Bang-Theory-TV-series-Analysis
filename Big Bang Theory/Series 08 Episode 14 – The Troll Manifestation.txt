b'Scene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nPenny: So, tell me about your day, how\xe2\x80\x99s it going with the particle detector?\nLeonard: Wow, you remember that?\nPenny: Yeah, I listen to what you say. You\xe2\x80\x99re building a particle detector using superfluid helium.\nLeonard: You know, when you talk like that, I want to take you right here on this table.\nPenny: And you know from past experience this table cannot support both our weight. So, how\xe2\x80\x99s the detector going?\nLeonard: Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s tricky working with superfluids. Whatever container you put them in, they kind of creep up the sides and crawl out all on their own.\nPenny: Kind of like Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s ant farm.\nLeonard: Exactly, except you don\xe2\x80\x99t have a lunatic running around, yelling, I fed you sugar water, why are you biting me? Come on, this is boring, you really want to talk about this?\nPenny: No, I do. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t write superfluid helium on this napkin for nothing.\nLeonard: Okay, well, this is cool. Uh, there\xe2\x80\x99s a thing called superfluid vacuum theory, where empty space is imagined as a superfluid with all of its qualities, viscosity, density, surface tension\xe2\x80\xa6\nPenny: Hey, if you\xe2\x80\x99re pausing for dramatic effect, I\xe2\x80\x99d keep it moving.\nLeonard: No, no. People don\xe2\x80\x99t talk about surface tension. If you imagine our three-space as the surface of an N-dimensional superfluid bubble\xe2\x80\xa6 This is exciting. This is really exciting. I have to go find Sheldon.\nPenny: Okay, well, if you find him, use the kitchen island, that coffee table will not support both of you.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: Which means a spherical multidimensional superfluid shows the same negative-energy density as space-time. So what do you think? What do you think? So what do you think?\nSheldon: Hmm.\nLeonard: What? Is it wrong? Have you seen it somewhere else?\nSheldon: Hmm.\nLeonard: I know this isn\xe2\x80\x99t my area, and I could never do the math like you can, but could this be something?\nSheldon: Well, you could have set Newton\xe2\x80\x99s gravitational constant to one. And, ugh, the whole thing reeks of blueberry. You know I can\xe2\x80\x99t stand these scented markers.\nLeonard: No one told you to taste them. Come on, is, is this good or not?\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s good.\nLeonard: Really?\nSheldon: I like it. I think you\xe2\x80\x99re on to something.\nLeonard: You do? You\xe2\x80\x99re not messing with me?\nSheldon: Not at all. In fact, I have got something for just such an occasion. I was starting to think I might never get a chance to give it to you. Good job.\nLeonard: You\xe2\x80\x99re giving me a sticker?\nSheldon: Not just a sticker. That is a sticker of a kitty saying me-wow.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m not a preschooler.\nSheldon: Fine, I\xe2\x80\x99ll take it back.\nLeonard: I earned this. Back off.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: You\xe2\x80\x99re still awake?\nSheldon: For a man whose last observation was our universe may be the surface of a multidimensional supercooled liquid, you\xe2\x80\x99re still awake seems like quite the sophomore slump.\nLeonard: You worked out all the math.\nSheldon: Oh, I did more than work out all the math. I wrote a paper.\nLeonard: You wrote a paper on my idea?\nSheldon: I wrote a paper on our idea.\nLeonard: When did my idea become our idea?\nSheldon: When I mixed it with Sheldony goodness and cooked it in the Easy-Bake oven of my mind.\nLeonard: This is good. Our idea is really good.\nSheldon: Well, the lightbulb in this oven is ridiculously bright.\nLeonard: You know, if no one\xe2\x80\x99s thought of this, yet, this could be a big deal.\nSheldon: Only way we\xe2\x80\x99ll know for sure is if we post it online to the pre-print server. I have it ready to go, but I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t gonna do it without you.\nLeonard: Wow, it\xe2\x80\x99s all happening so fast. Should we just sleep on it?\nSheldon: We could, but we always run the risk of someone else beating us to the punch.\nLeonard: You\xe2\x80\x99re sure it\xe2\x80\x99s good?\nSheldon: My name is right on there with yours. That is a surefire mark of quality. That might as well say directed by Joss Whedon.\nLeonard: Okay, partner, let\xe2\x80\x99s do it.\nSheldon: Come on. Click the mouse with me.\nLeonard: One, two three.\nTogether: Click.\nLeonard: Well, we did it.\nSheldon: Yes, we did, my friend.\nLeonard: Is your tongue blue?\nSheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to talk about it.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nBernadette: Okay, movie night, what do you want to watch?\nAmy: Whatever happened to that ape movie you were in?\nPenny: Oh, God. Probably nothing. I think I saw the director twirling a sign outside the Verizon store.\nBernadette: Search for it.\nPenny: What, no, why?\nBernadette: \xe2\x80\x98Cause it would be fun to watch.\nPenny: It would be humiliating.\nBernadette: Well, now we have two reasons.\nAmy: They have it.\nBernadette: Please, can we watch it?\nAmy: Please?\nPenny: Fine, but I\xe2\x80\x99m telling you, it\xe2\x80\x99s terrible.\nAmy: Have you even seen it?\nPenny: No.\nBernadette: Well, maybe it turned out better than you think.\nVoice on TV: Bananas, get your fresh bananas.\nBernadette: Ho-ho, it really didn\xe2\x80\x99t.\nScene: Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s laboratory.\nLeonard: Sheldon, this is superfluid helium. Put this in your mouth, your tongue will freeze and break off.\nSheldon: Does it smell like blueberries?\nLeonard: No.\nSheldon: Then we\xe2\x80\x99re probably okay.\nHoward: Hey, your paper got mentioned on the Quantum Diaries physics blog.\nLeonard: Really? What\xe2\x80\x99d they say?\nHoward: Uh, it\xe2\x80\x99s basically a summary of the theory, but there\xe2\x80\x99s a bunch of positive comments on the message board.\nLeonard: Let me see, let me see. One calls it insightful and innovative. We\xe2\x80\x99re insightful and innovative.\nSheldon: Oh, nice to meet you, Mr. Insightful.\nLeonard: Oh, the pleasure is mine, Mr. Innovative. Uh, another one says the concept shows some real out-of-the-box thinking. Do you hear that, Mr. Out-Of-The?\nSheldon: I do, indeed, Mr. Box-Thinking.\nHoward: How are you today, Mr. Can-You-Believe-These-Jack-Asses?\nRaj: Just dandy, Mr I-Wish-I-Was-Better-At-Improv.\nSheldon: Read another one.\nLeonard: Okay, okay. Uh, the analogy between space-time and a supercooled fluid is either meaningless or false. I wish this blog would devote itself to real science instead of wasting our time with crackpot wannabe theoreticians in a rush to publish.\nSheldon: Who wrote that?\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s anonymous, and user name General Relativity.\nSheldon: Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m responding to it.\nLeonard: Uh, don\xe2\x80\x99t lower yourself to their level.\nSheldon: Look, I am simply going to defend our work, scientist to scientist. And failing that, suggest that his mother enjoys a string of both human and non-human lovers.\nLeonard: Sheldon, my name\xe2\x80\x99s on that paper, too. There\xe2\x80\x99s no upside to doing this.\nSheldon: He just left another comment.\nRaj: What does it say?\nLeonard: Upon review, I\xe2\x80\x99ve changed my mind about the Cooper-Hofstadter hypothesis that space-time is like a superfluid. In fact, it\xe2\x80\x99s inspired me to come up with my own theory. Maybe space-time is like two clowns with their heads in a bucket, much like Cooper and Hofstadter.\nSheldon: Can I respond now?\nLeonard: Do it.\nSheldon: You mess with the bull, you get the horns. I\xe2\x80\x99m about to show this guy just how horny I can be.\nLeonard: Somebody else do it.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nPenny (on television): Doctor, please help me. I think I might be turning into a killer gorilla.\nDoctor: Why do you think you\xe2\x80\x99re turning into a killer gorilla and not just a regular gorilla?\nPenny (on television): Because regular gorillas are vegetarians, and I just bit the fingers off your receptionist.\nPenny: Okay, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen plenty.\nBernadette: No, give me the remote.\nAmy: Careful. She\xe2\x80\x99ll bite your fingers off.\nPenny: Okay, well, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been poking around the internet, and I think I found something we\xe2\x80\x99ll enjoy watching even more.\nAmy: What is it?\nPenny: Oh, just a video of Bernadette in a beauty pageant.\nAmy: What?\nBernadette: Okay, I learned my lesson. Making fun of people is wrong.\nAmy: I haven\xe2\x80\x99t learned my lesson. Play it. Play it.\nBernadette (on screen): Hi. I\xe2\x80\x99m Bernadette Maryann Rostenkowski from Yorba Linda, California.\nPenny: You look like a talking cupcake.\nBernadette (on screen): And you should pick me for Miss California Quiznos 1999, because I want to (singing) tell you what I want, what I really really want, l tell you what I want, what I really really want, I wanna, I wanna, I wanna, I wanna Really, really, really be Miss California Quiznos 1999.\nAmy: Play it again. Play it again.\nScene: The apartment.\nRaj: Did he respond yet?\nSheldon: Hmm. No, not yet.\nLeonard: Well, maybe we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have sunk to his level.\nHoward: It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t that bad.\nLeonard: Read it back one more time.\nSheldon: My good sir, we are neither crackpots nor wannabes. In fact, we are experts in our fields. And while you hide behind your anonymity, we stand behind our paper. And later tonight, your mother.\nLeonard: And you don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x99s too rough?\nSheldon: We\xe2\x80\x99re just standing behind her. It\xe2\x80\x99s not like we\xe2\x80\x99re gonna say boo and scare her.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nPenny: How could you not tell us you were in beauty pageants?\nBernadette: \xe2\x80\x98Cause it\xe2\x80\x99s embarrassing.\nPenny: It is; it truly is.\nBernadette: Yeah, well, Amy writes Little House on the Prairie fan fiction about herself and posts it on the Internet.\nPenny: No.\nAmy: Why? What did I do?\nBernadette: Sorry, I had to get the spotlight off me, and tearing down other women is part of my pageant training.\nPenny: Okay. We are reading that right now.\nAmy: No, please don\xe2\x80\x99t.\nBernadette: We got embarrassed tonight. Come on.\nAmy: But it\xe2\x80\x99s personal.\nPenny: Why? Is it about you and Sheldon?\nAmy: No.\nPenny: Oh, my God, it\xe2\x80\x99s about her and Sheldon.\nAmy: It\xe2\x80\x99s not about me and Sheldon. It\xe2\x80\x99s about a young woman in the 1800s named Amelia, and the time-traveling physicist named Cooper she falls in love with.\nPenny: Please show us?\nBernadette: Please?\nAmy: No.\nPenny: You know I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna read it either way.\nAmy: Good luck finding it.\nPenny: Amelia and the time-trav\xe2\x80\xa6 found it. It was just past dawn on the prairie, and like every morning, Amelia prepared to do her chores. Except something about this morning felt different.\nBernadette: Why? Why did it feel different?\nPenny: Maybe it was the first whisper of winter in the air, or maybe it was the unconscious handsome man with porcelain skin and curious clothing she was about to discover lying in the field. A man who would open her mind to new possibilities and her body to new feelings.\nAmy: You know, there was a time when I was alone and had no friends. I\xe2\x80\x99m starting to miss that.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: He still hasn\xe2\x80\x99t responded. What\xe2\x80\x99s taking him so long?\nLeonard: Do you really want him to write back?\nSheldon: Yeah, I do. Then no matter how he responds, I am going to destroy him with a picture of a bored cat saying oh, really?\nLeonard: Me-wow.\nHoward: What are you doing?\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99ve, uh, created some other user accounts so I can post positive comments about their paper.\nHoward: This wee li\xe2\x80\x99l bairn of a theory nearly blew my kilt off.\nRaj: No. You have to read it how Dr. Angus McDougal of the University of Edinburgh would. This wee li\xe2\x80\x99l bairn of a theory nearly blew me kilt off.\nSheldon: He wrote back. Cooper and Hofstadter resorting to juvenile attempts at humour is proof they have nothing to back up their ridiculous paper. It should come as no surprise given they work at Cal Tech, essentially a technical school, where even the physicists are basically engineers. Engineers? Do you know how insulting that is?\nHoward: Yes.\nRaj: Guys, this person\xe2\x80\x99s just going out of their way to get a rise out of you.\nSheldon: Yeah, but it\xe2\x80\x99s still so aggravating.\nRaj: Yeah, well, all the other comments said really nice things. Focus on those.\nHoward: Yeah. Dr. Dmitri Plancovik of Moscow University said dis paper great, I love it more than wodka.\nRaj: See? Better with the accent.\nSheldon: And send.\nLeonard: What did you write?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m done hiding from bullies. I\xe2\x80\x99m taking this into the real world.\nLeonard: What does that mean?\nSheldon: I told him we\xe2\x80\x99ll meet him face-to-face anytime, anywhere.\nLeonard: Are you crazy? You don\xe2\x80\x99t know who this person is. Delete that.\nRaj: Come on, Sheldon!\nSheldon: Oh, okay, okay, calm down. (Skype tone) It\xe2\x80\x99s him. He\xe2\x80\x99s trying to video chat. Perhaps I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have taken this into the real world.\nLeonard: Oh, really?\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nPenny: \xe2\x80\x9cTime travel? I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand,\xe2\x80\x9d said Amelia. Cooper stared at her. \xe2\x80\x98Which word don\xe2\x80\x99t you understand, time or travel?\xe2\x80\x9d\nBernadette: Wow, even in your fantasies Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s kind of exhausting.\nAmy: He\xe2\x80\x99s like that in the beginning, so she can change him. It\xe2\x80\x99s called good writing. And wishful thinking.\nPenny: It stung Amelia when he spoke to her this way. In her little one-room schoolhouse, she was always the smartest student, regularly besting the boys in her class, but this was no boy in front of her, this was a man.\nBernadette: Here we go.\nPenny: Cooper told Amelia about all the strange and incredible things the future would hold, like computers and living past 30. He asked her if she had any questions. All she longed to ask was if his heart was beating as fast as hers, but she was too afraid to hear the answer.\nBernadette: Oh, Amelia.\nPenny: So instead she asked if, in the future, Montana ever became a state.\nAmy: In the 1800s that was considered flirting.\nScene: The apartment.\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99m so sick of people being mean on the Internet.\nHoward: Well, I think the anonymity makes everyone feel like they can say things they\xe2\x80\x99d never say to your face.\nSheldon: Interesting. I can\xe2\x80\x99t think of a single thing I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say to someone\xe2\x80\x99s face.\nLeonard: Never noticed that about you.\nRaj: You know what? At least you guys did something. You know, you, you had a theory, you wrote a paper, you made an actual contribution. All guys like this do is just stand on other people\xe2\x80\x99s work.\nSheldon: He\xe2\x80\x99s right. I say we call this person back. We\xe2\x80\x99ve got no reason to hide.\nLeonard: All right, do it. Call him. Let\xe2\x80\x99s find out what this loser\xe2\x80\x99s ever accomplished.\nSheldon: Click it with me. One, two, three, click.\nStephen Hawking: Well, hello there.\nSheldon: Professor Hawking?\nStephen Hawking: Oh, brother, you should see the look on your faces.\nLeonard: You really didn\xe2\x80\x99t like our paper?\nStephen Hawking: I like your paper very much. The premise is intriguing.\nSheldon: Then why are you attacking us?\nStephen Hawking: If you were sitting in a chair for 40 years, you\xe2\x80\x99d get bored, too. Anyway, got to go. I promised to help the neighbour kid with his maths homework. Ciao.\nLeonard: Stephen Hawking liked our paper. Said the premise is intriguing.\nSheldon: Good to see you again, Mr. Stephen-Hawking Liked-Our-Paper.\nLeonard: And you as well, Mr. Our-Premise-Is-Intriguing.\nHoward: How do you do, Mr. I\xe2\x80\x99ll-Admit-That\xe2\x80\x99s-Pretty-Cool?\nRaj: Yeah, you keep setting me up for failure.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nPenny: With a heavy heart, Amelia stood before the newly repaired time machine. She regretted giving Cooper the part he needed.\nBernadette: Because she wanted him to give her the part she needed.\nAmy: Okay, that\xe2\x80\x99s enough.\nPenny: What? No, I really want to know what happens, and Bernadette really, really, really wants to know what happens.\nAmy: You\xe2\x80\x99re just making fun of me.\nBernadette: I was just kidding. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. And the story\xe2\x80\x99s really good.\nPenny: No, it is. Does he stay? Do they kiss? Does she find out about Montana?\nBernadette: Please?\nAmy: Fine. As Cooper prepared to depart, tears filled Amelia\xe2\x80\x99s eyes. He took her hand in his and said, \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t stay, but I will never forget you.\xe2\x80\x9d He brushed his fingers against her cheek, then quickly stepped into the machine. \xe2\x80\x9cPlease don\xe2\x80\x99t go,\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered. But it was too late. The engine hummed to life.\nBernadette: But they didn\xe2\x80\x99t even kiss.\nAmy: She turned away, wiping her eyes. She couldn\xe2\x80\x99t bear to watch her one chance at true love disappear forever. Then she felt a strong hand on her shoulder spin her around. It was Cooper.\nPenny: Yes.\nAmy: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat about the future?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Amelia. He looked deeply into her eyes and whispered, \xe2\x80\x9cThere is no future without you.\xe2\x80\x9d He pulled her in close. She began to tremble all over. She felt his warm breath\xe2\x80\xa6\nLeonard: You will not believe what Stephen Hawking just said.\nPenny: Get out!\nBernadette: Not now!\nScene: An 1800\xe2\x80\x99s house.\nAmelia: Is the water warm enough?\nCooper: Given the fact that you took the time to build a wood fire, draw the water from the well and heat it, it would be rude to complain. But since you asked, it\xe2\x80\x99s a little nippy.\nAmelia: I can fix that. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help but notice your unusual undergarments.\nCooper: They\xe2\x80\x99re not undergarments. They\xe2\x80\x99re Underoos. Where I come from, they\xe2\x80\x99re known as underwear that\xe2\x80\x99s fun to wear.\nAmelia: And what\xe2\x80\x99s the significance of the spider?\nCooper: Oh, that represents Spider-Man. He does whatever a spider can.\nAmelia: There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of rhyming in the future, isn\xe2\x80\x99t there?\nLeonard (in bed): You\xe2\x80\x99re right. This is even weirder than I thought.\nPenny: You want me to stop reading?\nLeonard: Are you kidding? No, no.\nPenny: As he stood for Amelia to dry him\xe2\x80\xa6\nAmelia: So, tell me, Cooper, are the ways of physical love different in the future?\nLeonard: Yeah, okay, I\xe2\x80\x99m good.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
