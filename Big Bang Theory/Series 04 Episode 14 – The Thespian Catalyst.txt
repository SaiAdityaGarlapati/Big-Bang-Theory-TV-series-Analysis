b'Scene: A lecture hall.\nSheldon: Good evening. I\xe2\x80\x99m your guest lecturer, Dr. Sheldon Cooper. I was expecting applause, but I suppose stunned silence is equally appropriate. I agreed to speak to you this evening, because I was told that you\xe2\x80\x99re the best and the brightest of this university\xe2\x80\x99s doctoral candidates. Hmm. Of course, that\xe2\x80\x99s like saying you are the most important electron in a hydrogen atom. \xe2\x80\x98Cause, you see, there\xe2\x80\x99s only one electron in a hydrogen atom. Best and brightest, my sweet patootie. All right, let\xe2\x80\x99s begin. Show of hands, who here is familiar with the concept of topological insulators? Don\xe2\x80\x99t kid yourselves.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: I found another tweet from a student at Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s lecture. Dr. Cooper has taken a relatively boring subject and managed to make it completely insufferable. Plus, he looks like a giant insect.\nHoward: Look. Listen to this one. Does Einstein\xe2\x80\x99s theory explain why time flies when you\xe2\x80\x99re having fun, but when you\xe2\x80\x99re listening to Dr. Cooper, it falls out of the sky, dead?\nRaj: Ooh, somebody took pictures and uploaded them to their Flickr account.\nLeonard: Wow. How do you get an entire lecture hall to flip you off at the same time?\nHoward: Apparently, if you\xe2\x80\x99re Sheldon, all you need to do is turn your back.\nPenny: Hey, Leonard, is your wi-fi down? I can\xe2\x80\x99t get on.\nLeonard: Oh, Sheldon changed the password. It\xe2\x80\x99s now Penny is a freeloader. No spaces.\nPenny: Thanks. What are you guys doing?\nLeonard: Sheldon gave a lecture at the university tonight. We\xe2\x80\x99re reading the reviews.\nPenny: Oh. How\xe2\x80\x99d he do?\nHoward: Well, picture the Hindenburg meets Chernobyl meets Three Mile Island meets Tron 2.\nPenny: That bad, huh?\nLeonard: Read this woman\xe2\x80\x99s tweet.\nPenny: Listening to Dr. Cooper has made me want to start cutting myself again\nLeonard: Yeah.\nSheldon: Good evening, Leonard, Howard, Raj, freeloader.\nHoward: So, how\xe2\x80\x99d the lecture go?\nLeonard: In a word, triumphant.\nLeonard: Really? Triumphant?\nSheldon: Oh, yes, you should have seen those young people. Thirsty for knowledge, drinking in my wisdom. I may have changed a few lives today.\nPenny: Oh, please let me tell him.\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, I kind of promised Howard.\nSheldon: Tell me what?\nHoward: Actually, we should all share the moment. Raj, if you would.\nSheldon: Oh, tweets about my lecture. Hmm. That\xe2\x80\x99s rather unfair. That\xe2\x80\x99s downright cruel. Plus, insects have six legs. Yeah, I\xe2\x80\x99m not familiar with the acronym KMN.\nLeonard: Oh, uh, from the context, we think it means kill me now.\nSheldon: Well, I suppose everyone\xe2\x80\x99s entitled to their own opinion. I think I\xe2\x80\x99ll turn in. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to teach those poopy heads, anyway.\nHoward: FYI, I think that\xe2\x80\x99s what Darth Vader said just before he started building the Death Star.\nScene: The Cheesecake Factory\nHoward: Sheldon still moping?\nLeonard: Yeah, it\xe2\x80\x99s weird. Even though he didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to give the lecture in the first place, being rejected by those students really hit him hard.\nRaj: Mmm, I know the feeling. It\xe2\x80\x99s like accidentally walking into a gay bar and then having no one hit on you. It-It happened to a friend of mine.\nBernadette: Are you guys doing okay?\nHoward: Yeah, Leonard and I are fine, but I think Raj needs to meet a girl really soon.\nBernadette: Well, that shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be too hard. He\xe2\x80\x99s such a cutie.\nRaj: Thank you, but cute is for bunnies. I want to be something with sex appeal, like, like a labradoodle.\nHoward: Labradoodle?\nLeonard: We might be starting to zero in on your problem.\nBernadette: Don\xe2\x80\x99t you listen to them. You\xe2\x80\x99ve got plenty of sex appeal.\nRaj: You really think so?\nBernadette: Yeah. You\xe2\x80\x99re a hottie.\nRaj: Well, thanks, Bernadette. And just for the record, labradoodles are hypo-allergenic, which is a very sexy quality to those troubled by animal dander.\nScene: The apartment.\nAmy (on webcam, with an undersea background): So, what do you think?\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s a charming illusion, but it does not cheer me up.\nAmy: Not even when I do this? (Pretends to be a fish)\nSheldon: No.\nAmy: Well, that was the last arrow in my quiver of whimsy.\nSheldon: Do you realize that teaching is the first thing I\xe2\x80\x99ve failed at since my ill-fated attempt to complete a chin-up in March of 1989?\nAmy: If this humiliating experience is really troubling you, there are things we could do about it.\nSheldon: For instance?\nAmy: Well, the first thing that comes to mind is isolating the part of your brain where the memory is stored and destroying it with a laser.\nSheldon: Hmm, no. One slip of the hand, and suddenly I\xe2\x80\x99m sitting in the Engineering Department, building doodads with Wolowitz.\nAmy: All right. Have you considered improving your socialization skills, thus allowing you to communicate more effectively with other people?\nSheldon: Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that their burden? I\xe2\x80\x99m the one with something interesting to say.\nAmy: Fair enough, but in its essence, teaching is a performance art. In the classroom paradigm, the teacher has the responsibility to communicate, as well as entertain and engage.\nSheldon: I sense that you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to slow-walk me to an epiphany. Would you mind very much jumping to it?\nAmy: Perhaps you should consider taking acting lessons.\nSheldon: Acting lessons. Interesting. It might help if I could act as though I care about my students and whether or not they learn.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment door.\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny.\nPenny: What?\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re an (finger quotes) actress, correct?\nPenny: I\xe2\x80\x99m not an (finger quotes)actress. I\xe2\x80\x99m an actress.\nSheldon: All right. You\xe2\x80\x99re an actress. I need you to teach me.\nPenny: You want an acting lesson?\nSheldon: Perhaps two. I\xe2\x80\x99d like to master the craft.\nPenny: Okay, where is this coming from?\nSheldon: It has been suggested to me that acting techniques could improve my lecturing, at which, if certain tweets and blogs are to be believed, I suck the big one.\nPenny: Yeah, I saw those. They were funny. I printed a few out and put \xe2\x80\x99em on my fridge.\nSheldon: So, when could we start?\nPenny: Okay, just to be clear. You are asking me for help because I know something that the brilliant Dr. Sheldon Cooper doesn\xe2\x80\x99t.\nSheldon: I suppose that\xe2\x80\x99s one way to look at it.\nPenny: I think it\xe2\x80\x99s the only way to look at it.\nSheldon: Are you going to help me or not?\nPenny: Probably. I\xe2\x80\x99m just enjoying the foreplay. Does this mean you are done mocking my acting career?\nSheldon: Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, I thought making the transition from actor to acting teacher was the signal that one\xe2\x80\x99s career had reached the end of the road.\nPenny: Forget it.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99ll pay you 40 dollars.\nPenny: Saturday, nine a.m. Bring cash.\nScene: The university cafeteria\nHoward: Raj, I have amazing news!\nRaj: What?\nHoward: I just got offered a fellowship at the Weitzmann Institute in Israel.\nRaj: Dude, that\xe2\x80\x99s incredible!\nHoward: I know. The only thing is, I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna be gone for two years.\nRaj: Aw, I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna miss you. Are you going with him?\nBernadette: I have to stay here for school.\nHoward: That\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99re here to talk to you about. You see, Bernadette has needs.\nRaj: What kind of needs?\nHoward: Sexual needs.\nBernadette: Most of them regular, some of them kind of messed up.\nHoward: So, while I\xe2\x80\x99m gone, you\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to satisfy her.\nBernadette: What do you say?\nRaj: I say okey-dokey.\nHoward (to the real Raj who is daydreaming): What ya thinking so hard about?\nRaj: Just that I\xe2\x80\x99m definitely not gay.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny.\nPenny: What\xe2\x80\x99s wrong?\nSheldon: Nothing. I was acting.\nPenny: You were acting?\nSheldon: Yes. In preparation for today\xe2\x80\x99s studies, I read Stanislavski\xe2\x80\x99s An Actor Prepares, Stella Adler\xe2\x80\x99s\nThe Technique of Acting, Uta Hagen\xe2\x80\x99s Respect for Acting, and Henry Winkler\xe2\x80\x99s Heyyy, I\xe2\x80\x99m an Actor.\nPenny: Well, good for you. Come on in.\nSheldon: How shall we begin?\nPenny: Well, I thought we\xe2\x80\x99d start with some basic movement exercises. You know, get our bodies warmed up a little.\nSheldon: All right.\nPenny: So I just want you to relax and kind of move around in the space. You know, just do whatever feels natural. Sheldon?\nSheldon (doing nothing): You said to do whatever feels natural. This feels natural. Certainly more natural than what you\xe2\x80\x99re doing.\nPenny: Come on, you got to work with me. We need to get connected with our bodies.\nSheldon: Penny, my body and I have a relationship that works best when we maintain a cool, wary distance from each other.\nPenny: All right, let\xe2\x80\x99s just say we\xe2\x80\x99ve warmed up.\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re the teacher.\nPenny: Okay. One of the things that might help you in connecting with your students is being a little more spontaneous. So why don\xe2\x80\x99t we try some improvisation?\nSheldon: Why not? It seems like you\xe2\x80\x99re improvising your entire curriculum.\nPenny: This is all about listening and responding.\nSheldon: Gotcha.\nPenny: I\xe2\x80\x99m going to create a character and a situation, and you just jump in when you feel it.\nSheldon: All right.\nPenny: All right.\nSheldon: Action.\nPenny: Okay, it\xe2\x80\x99s not a movie. It\xe2\x80\x99s improv. So no one calls action.\nSheldon: Hey, you taught me something. Who would have thought it?\nPenny: Okay. Uh, no, the shipment has not arrived, and I really need those shoes. They are my biggest seller. Yes, ladies sizes six through ten. Thank you. Oh, sorry, I have to go, I have a customer. Bye-bye. Hi. Can I help you?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99d like a frozen yogurt, please.\nPenny: Yogurt?\nSheldon: Yeah.\nPenny: Um, okay, sure. Luckily, we sell both shoes and yogurt here.\nSheldon: You do?\nPenny: Yes. Look up at the sign, and remember, improv is always about saying yes.\nSheldon: All right. Yes. I see a sign. It says Camarillo State Mental Hospital.\nPenny: What?\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s the only explanation I can come up with for why you think you sell shoes and yogurt.\nPenny: Okay, you know what? Let\xe2\x80\x99s just try a different improv. Uh, oh, this time we will be two winos living under a freeway overpass.\nSheldon: Oh, and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to use props?\nPenny: You bet. I had dreams, you know. I was gonna be famous. Show everybody back home I could be someone. Now look at me. Want some?\nSheldon: You have any frozen yogurt?\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m still not adjusted to how the SyFy channel spells their name now. S-Y-F-Y. That\xe2\x80\x99s siffy.\nRaj: Uh-huh.\nLeonard (phone rings): Hello? Oh, my God! Is he okay?\nRaj: What happened?\nLeonard: Hang on. Hang on. Uh-huh. Okay, thank you. Howard was on his scooter, and got hit by a truck. He\xe2\x80\x99s in critical condition.\nRaj: Oh, no!\nBernadette: Did you hear? Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it terrible?\nLeonard: Have you seen him?\nBernadette: They wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t let me in. Oh my Howie.\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99ll be okay. It\xe2\x80\x99ll be okay.\nRaj: It\xe2\x80\x99ll be okay. It\xe2\x80\x99ll be okay. (Phone rings) It\xe2\x80\x99s Howard. Howard, hello.\nHoward: Raj, is that you?\nRaj: Yeah, I\xe2\x80\x99m right here, buddy. How are you?\nHoward: Shh, shh. Listen to me. I\xe2\x80\x99m not gonna make it.\nRaj: No, no, no, don\xe2\x80\x99t say that. You\xe2\x80\x99re going to be all right.\nHoward: Raj, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have time. Now, pay attention. My last wish is that you look after Bernadette.\nRaj: Of course, of course. Now when you say look after, you mean\xe2\x80\xa6\nBernadette: Sexually.\nRaj: Excuse me, Bernadette. I have to hear it from him.\nHoward: Sexually.\nRaj: Got it. Take care. I guess I have no choice but to make sweet, guilt-free love to you over and over again for the rest of my life.\nBernadette: That\xe2\x80\x99s how I heard it.\nLeonard (out of Raj\xe2\x80\x99s daydream): Or it could be sy-fee.\nRaj: What?\nLeonard: S-Y-F-Y. Sy-fee.\nRaj: Oh, right. Good one.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nPenny: So, did you get a chance to go over the scene I gave you?\nSheldon: Yes. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t care for it.\nPenny: Okay, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof is an American classic.\nSheldon: So is the McRib sandwich. I don\xe2\x80\x99t care for that, either.\nPenny: Fine. What would you rather do as a scene study?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m glad you asked. I took the liberty of adapting a Star Trek fan fiction novella I wrote when I was ten into a one-act play.\nPenny: And you think it\xe2\x80\x99s better than Tennessee Williams?\nSheldon: Why don\xe2\x80\x99t we leave that for future generations to decide?\nPenny: Where No Sheldon Has Gone Before.\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s the story of a young boy who is transported from the ignorant backwoods of East Texas to the 23rd Century, where his genius is not only appreciated, but celebrated.\nPenny: KMN.\nSheldon: Now, in this pivotal scene, Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s mother, played by you, argues with an emissary of the United Federation of Planets, Mr. Spock, the role I will bring to life.\nPenny: Okay, that\xe2\x80\x99s fine, but let\xe2\x80\x99s try and get you out of your comfort zone.\nSheldon: Why would we want to do that? It\xe2\x80\x99s called the comfort zone for a reason.\nPenny: Okay, the whole point of this is to loosen you up a little, so I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking you\xe2\x80\x99ll play the role of your mother, and I will bring life to Mr. Spock.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. You\xe2\x80\x99ll be Spock?\nPenny: It\xe2\x80\x99s only logical.\nSheldon: Very well. I\xe2\x80\x99ll set the scene.\nPenny: All right.\nSheldon: East Texas. A warm summer night. A woman, Mary, stands on a porch. In the distance, we hear a lonesome train whistle. Woo-woo. The droning buzz of cicadas. Zzzzzzzzz. A coyote howls at the moon, frightening sensitive young boys everywhere. Aw-aw-aw! Out in the woods, an owl screeches.\nPenny: Okay, okay. We get it. You set the scene.\nSheldon: Hoo!\nPenny: Now just read your mother\xe2\x80\x99s line.\nSheldon: Shelly! Shelly, how many times have I told you not to leave your sciencey stuff out on the porch? Goodness, I\xe2\x80\x99ll never understand that boy. But then again, I\xe2\x80\x99m a religious nut, and my mind is closed to so many things.\nPenny: Woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo. Spock to Enterprise. Transport successful.\nSheldon: Glory be to Heaven, some sort of creature just manifested out of thin air. George, put down that Pepsi can full of bourbon that ain\xe2\x80\x99t foolin\xe2\x80\x99 no one, and get your shotgun!\nPenny: Greetings, Mary Cooper. I am Spock.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. I just don\xe2\x80\x99t buy it.\nPenny: Just keep going!\nSheldon: Oh, my, your sudden appearance startles me.\nPenny: We have been monitoring your son Sheldon from the 23rd Century, and we have determined that he is now ready to join us. His unique genius is our best hope for bringing peace to a vast and troubled galaxy.\nSheldon: I understand. Oh, Shelly? A man\xe2\x80\x99s here to take you away to the future! Be sure to pack clean underwear.\xe2\x80\x9d\nPenny: Okay, okay, let\xe2\x80\x99s try that last line again, and this time, maybe try choking up a little.\nSheldon: Why?\nPenny: Well, you\xe2\x80\x99re losing your son.\nSheldon: Yes, but he\xe2\x80\x99s going to a better place where he won\xe2\x80\x99t get beat up. So much.\nPenny: All right, come on, just try it my way. Pretend you\xe2\x80\x99re sad to see him go. I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna lead you in. His unique genius is our best hope for bringing peace to a vast and troubled galaxy. That\xe2\x80\x99s your cue.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. I just love that line. Even the way you do it.\nPenny: All right, come on, come on. Put some real emotion into it. Blah-blah, blah, blah, vast and troubled galaxy. Go.\nSheldon: Oh, Shelly? A man\xe2\x80\x99s here to take you away to the future. Be sure to pack clean underwear.\nPenny: That\xe2\x80\x99s good. That\xe2\x80\x99s good. That\xe2\x80\x99s good.\nSheldon: Mommy, why are you crying? \xe2\x80\x98Cause I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna miss you, Shelly-bean, even though you creep the bejeezus out of me.\nPenny: Okay, I guess we\xe2\x80\x99re improvising now.\nSheldon: Well I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. It\xe2\x80\x99s not my fault. I\xe2\x80\x99m just incredibly smart, and everyone around here is dumber than a bag of rocks. Oh, now, don\xe2\x80\x99t you start crying. You get in that spaceship. Mommy\xe2\x80\x99s late for Indian bingo.\nPenny (on phone): Mrs. Cooper, hey, it\xe2\x80\x99s Penny. Yeah, I think I broke your son. Hey, hold on. Talk to your mother.\nSheldon: Mommy, I love you. Don\xe2\x80\x99t let Spock take me to the future!\nScene: The cafeteria.\nBernadette: Okay, Raj, I know you\xe2\x80\x99ve been avoiding me and Howard, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not leaving until you tell me what\xe2\x80\x99s going on inside that little head of yours.\n(Scene turns into a Bollywood musical)\nRaj (singing): Like the wild elephant I am trumpeting my love for you!\nBernadette (singing): Like a hidden flower my sweet fragrance comes into view!\nRaj (singing): My heart burns for you like the sun at noon!\nBernadette (singing): My desert welcomes you like the rainy monsoon!\nRaj (singing): You are my heart!\nBernadette (singing): My universe!\nRaj (singing): You are my heart!\nBernadette (singing): My universe!\nBoth together (singing): My universe!\nChorus of everyone in cafeteria (singing): Hey! You are my heart! My universe! You are my heart! My universe! You are my heart! My universe! My universe!\nRaj (out of daydream): Dance number aside, I\xe2\x80\x99m so not gay.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
