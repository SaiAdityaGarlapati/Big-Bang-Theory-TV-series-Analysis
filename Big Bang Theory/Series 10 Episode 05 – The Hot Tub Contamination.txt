b'Following a previously on scene\xe2\x80\xa6\nScene: The apartment.\nPenny: Okay, I\xe2\x80\x99m confused. Which one is Mr. Robot?\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you a hint. We\xe2\x80\x99re watching Daredevil.\nSheldon: Will you two please inform Amy how much you enjoy adhering to a strict bathroom schedule?\nPenny: Can\xe2\x80\x99t.\nLeonard: Won\xe2\x80\x99t.\nPenny: Didn\xe2\x80\x99t.\nLeonard: Don\xe2\x80\x99t.\nAmy: I told you, you can\xe2\x80\x99t regulate every aspect of our lives.\nSheldon: I can if you\xe2\x80\x99d just roll over and accept your fate.\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry for bringing this over here.\nPenny: Believe me, we know what you\xe2\x80\x99re going through.\nLeonard: And I think the most helpful thing we can tell you is no backsies.\nPenny: Mm-hmm.\nAmy: Sheldon, I understand that you like things a certain way and I\xe2\x80\x99m willing to make some concessions, but you have to be open to compromise.\nPenny: She\xe2\x80\x99s right. That\xe2\x80\x99s reasonable.\nSheldon: Oh, look who\xe2\x80\x99s in favour of compromise, the woman who married Leonard Hofstadter.\nLeonard: Hey, she didn\xe2\x80\x99t compromise. She settled. There\xe2\x80\x99s a difference.\nPenny: Yeah. You tell him, babe.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The comic book store.\nRaj: What time do you and Bernadette head out?\nHoward: As soon as I get home. We\xe2\x80\x99re hoping to make it before dark.\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99ve never been to Palm Springs.\nStuart: Oh, you should go. It\xe2\x80\x99s terrific. I really thrive anywhere the women and the temperature are over 90.\nRaj: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. If I want to watch old people sweat, I can just FaceTime my family in India.\nStuart: It\xe2\x80\x99s nice you and Bernadette are getting away.\nHoward: Well, she wants us to spend more time together before the baby comes.\nStuart: So then what are you doing here buying comic books?\nHoward: Well, he wants us to spend more time together before the baby comes.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: When you live with someone, there\xe2\x80\x99s gonna be conflict. You just have to keep communicating.\nSheldon: Well I\xe2\x80\x99m open to that.\nAmy: Okay. Well, for starters, there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing wrong with keeping our toothbrushes in the same holder.\nPenny: Sheldon, what do you say to that?\nSheldon: I think we should see other people.\nAmy: What?\nSheldon: Well, as a male, I have an evolutionary drive to perpetuate my DNA. Restricting myself to a single partner is against my nature.\nAmy: We sleep together once a year. You want other partners?\nSheldon: Don\xe2\x80\x99t blame me. Blame your pal, biology. He\xe2\x80\x99s the pervert pulling the strings here.\nAmy: You wanna see other people? Go see other people.\nPenny: I hope one of those people is a monkey, \xe2\x80\x99cause this is bananas.\nLeonard: Hey, you can make jokes, but if this keeps up, he\xe2\x80\x99s gonna move back in here.\nPenny: All right. Well, let\xe2\x80\x99s just get them apart for a while so they can cool down.\nLeonard: Good. Then before we reintroduce them, we\xe2\x80\x99ll give him one of her sweaters so he can get used to her scent again.\nPenny: So it\xe2\x80\x99s okay for you to joke around?\nLeonard: No, that\xe2\x80\x99s actually what we did with him when Howard came back from space.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom.\nHoward: Honey, how ya feeling? (Sound of Bernadette vomiting violently) The book says at this stage of the pregnancy morning sickness should be going away. (More vomiting) So that\xe2\x80\x99s good news, right?\nBernadette (pff): The only thing I hate more than you right now is that book.\nHoward: There she is. Who\xe2\x80\x99s ready for a hot, three-hour car ride to the desert?\nBernadette: Next vomit is gonna be in your lap.\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. We don\xe2\x80\x99t have to go.\nBernadette: But it\xe2\x80\x99s our last chance to take a vacation that\xe2\x80\x99s just the two of us.\nHoward: How \xe2\x80\x99bout we stay here? We don\xe2\x80\x99t even have to tell anyone. It\xe2\x80\x99ll be like a secret vacation at home.\nBernadette: Keeping secrets from our friends, it does sound kinda fun.\nHoward: Does it sound sexy?\nBernadette: You just heard me throwing up.\nHoward: You bet I did.\nBernadette: You\xe2\x80\x99re so weird.\nHoward: You know what\xe2\x80\x99s weird? How turned on you are right now.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s car.\nSheldon: You know, people are quick to accuse me of being difficult to live with, but the truth is, Amy is just as challenging.\nPenny: Just as challenging?\nSheldon: Yes.\nPenny: As you?\nSheldon: Yes.\nPenny: Just as challenging as you?\nSheldon: When we\xe2\x80\x99re sleeping, she breathes on me. One night, it got so bad I almost grabbed Toto\nand headed for the storm cellar.\nPenny: Leonard breathes on me, too. It\xe2\x80\x99s not a big deal.\nSheldon: She\xe2\x80\x99s always complaining about people at work.\nPenny: Well, so does Leonard. It\xe2\x80\x99s kind of annoying, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not the end of the world.\nSheldon: Do you know that when I get out of the shower, she eyes me up and down like I\xe2\x80\x99m a piece of meat?\nPenny: You know, so does Leonard. Can\xe2\x80\x99t I just get ready in the morning without him giving me his goofy thumbs-up? Hey-hey-hey.\nSheldon: I know. Sometimes I would just like to be appreciated for my mind.\nPenny: Agreed. Thank you.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom.\nBernadette: That feels great.\nHoward: Well, pulling a quarter out of your ear isn\xe2\x80\x99t the only magic these hands can do. In fact, what\xe2\x80\x99s this between your toes?\nBernadette: Can you please stop making money come out of me for two minutes? Was that the front door?\nHoward: It sounded like it. Oh, my God. Someone\xe2\x80\x99s in the house.\nBernadette: Lock the door, lock the door.\nHoward: We should call the police.\nBernadette: Uh, I left my phone downstairs.\nHoward: Damn, so did I.\nBernadette: Wait, I have my iPad.\nHoward: What are we gonna do, e-mail 911?\nBernadette: That\xe2\x80\x99s not helpful.\nHoward: You know I rely on humour in times of stress.\nBernadette: Let me know when you start, because that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t funny.\nHoward: Is that the hot tub?\nBernadette: Who would use our hot tub?\nHoward: Well, the answer is both more and less disturbing than you think.\nBernadette: Who is it?\nHoward: Stuart. He heard me talking about us going away. I guess he decided to invite himself over?\nBernadette: Should we say something to him?\nHoward: Maybe. How \xe2\x80\x99bout, hey, you look like a boiled chicken breast?\nBernadette: I meant like, what are you doing here?\nHoward: Nah, that\xe2\x80\x99s not gonna hurt his feelings.\nScene: The apartment.\nAmy: Why is nothing easy with him?\nLeonard: Look, here\xe2\x80\x99s the thing you need to understand about Sheldon. He\xe2\x80\x99s the worst.\nAmy: I prefer to think of it as high-maintenance.\nLeonard: I prefer to think of myself as five-ten, but I still need to get all my pants hemmed.\nAmy: I guess I should have known what I was getting myself into.\nLeonard: Don\xe2\x80\x99t beat yourself up. You\xe2\x80\x99ve never lived with anyone before.\nAmy: That\xe2\x80\x99s true.\nLeonard: And you\xe2\x80\x99re starting out with Sheldon Cooper. That\xe2\x80\x99s like getting your first pet and having it be, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, what\xe2\x80\x99s a kind of pet that ruins your life?\nAmy: You\xe2\x80\x99re not making me feel better.\nLeonard: Look, even when Penny and I started living together, there was a learning curve. But I promise you, it does get easier.\nAmy: He put a sign up in the bathroom that says, number of days without Amy\xe2\x80\x99s hair on the soap.\nLeonard: Yeah. My record was six.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s house.\nBernadette: Is it me, or is there something fun about watching him just float there?\nHoward: Maybe this is why people get fish tanks. Who just turned the porch lights on?\nBernadette: Is someone else here?\nRaj: Hmm. They must have left the tub on. Good thing I stopped by. Ah. Aaaaah! What are you doing here?\nStuart: What are you doing here?\nRaj: Maybe Howard and Bernadette said I could be here.\nStuart: Did they?\nRaj: Answer the question, what are you doing here?\nStuart: I had nothing else to do tonight. The last couple of months, I come here when I know they\xe2\x80\x99re not home.\nBernadette: What?\nStuart: They heard me in the bushes once, but they thought I was a raccoon.\nBernadette: I told you raccoons don\xe2\x80\x99t say uh-oh.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s car.\nPenny: You know, one night, Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s nose whistled so loud, I swear it was like sleeping on a train track.\nSheldon: Have you noticed it\xe2\x80\x99s always an A-flat?\nPenny: Is it? Oh. It\xe2\x80\x99s like his sinuses are right here in the car.\nSheldon: If we\xe2\x80\x99re just going to drive around aimlessly, the least you could do is take me for ice cream.\nPenny: Yeah, I\xe2\x80\x99ll take you for ice cream.\nSheldon: Well, see, why can\xe2\x80\x99t Amy be that subservient? She has coitus one time, suddenly she\xe2\x80\x99s Gloria Steinem. Anyway, I suppose an ice cream parlour will be a good place to meet other women.\nPenny: Oh, please, you\xe2\x80\x99re barely interested in a physical relationship with one person. Why would you want to confuse and disappoint others?\nSheldon: Being with Amy has awoken the sexual creature within. When I see a pretty gal walking down the street, I think, hubba hubba, like any other guy.\nPenny: You kiss your mother with that mouth? \xe2\x80\x98Cause it\xe2\x80\x99s fine.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s house.\nRaj: Here you go.\nStuart: Thank you.\nRaj: Shall we toast?\nStuart: To Howard and Bernadette, and the house key they never asked me to return.\nBernadette: You said you got it back.\nHoward: Well, clearly, I lied.\nRaj: So how\xe2\x80\x99s your apartment?\nStuart: Not great. The electricity\xe2\x80\x99s out.\nRaj: So why don\xe2\x80\x99t you get it fixed?\nStuart: I called, and they\xe2\x80\x99re like, pay your bill.\nRaj: If you ever need somewhere to crash, there\xe2\x80\x99s always my place.\nStuart: Oh, no. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be an inconvenience. You\xe2\x80\x99ve got all your lady friends, and\xe2\x80\xa6\nRaj: Actually, I\xe2\x80\x99m single now.\nStuart: What? When did that happen?\nRaj: It\xe2\x80\x99s okay. It\xe2\x80\x99s by choice. Well, their choice, and it\xe2\x80\x99s not okay.\nStuart: Oh. Sorry. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know.\nRaj: Nobody does. I was embarrassed so I didn\xe2\x80\x99t say anything.\nBernadette: Why wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t he tell us? Are we bad friends?\nHoward: He\xe2\x80\x99s in our hot tub drinking our wine.\nBernadette: Yeah, he deserves to be alone.\nStuart: So you\xe2\x80\x99re back out on the dating scene now?\nRaj: Yeah, yeah, a little.\nStuart: Oh, that must be fun. How\xe2\x80\x99s that going?\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99m in a hot tub with you, so pretty bad.\nScene: The apartment.\nAmy: Maybe I should just give in to his stupid bathroom schedule.\nLeonard: No, don\xe2\x80\x99t do that.\nAmy: But you did.\nLeonard: Exactly. Learn from my mistakes. No matter where I am at 7:18am, there better be a toilet nearby.\nAmy: It\xe2\x80\x99s just so much easier to give him what he wants.\nLeonard: Oh, true, but think of how much you\xe2\x80\x99ve accomplished. Who got him to stop Purelling his pocket change?\nAmy: Me.\nLeonard: And who got him to put things other than gloves in the glove compartment?\nAmy: Me. It was mittens.\nLeonard: And who got him to try a turkey dog?\nAmy: That was actually Koothrappali, but I did let him spit it out in my hand.\nLeonard: How can you stop now? That\xe2\x80\x99s like walking out of Pinocchio right before he becomes a real boy.\nAmy: You know, you\xe2\x80\x99re right. I\xe2\x80\x99m in this relationship, too. I need to stand up for myself.\nLeonard: Of course you do.\nAmy: And if he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like it, he can move back here.\nLeonard: Oh. He can try. He\xe2\x80\x99d just need a good locksmith.\nScene: An ice-cream parlour.\nPenny: Well, who you gonna hit on? The girl in front of us got strawberry. That\xe2\x80\x99s your favourite.\nSheldon: No. No, if we both like it, I\xe2\x80\x99ll spend the rest of my life opening the freezer and going, aw, no strawberry.\nPenny: What about the girl behind the counter?\nSheldon: Hmm? Well, she spends her whole day scooping. One arm\xe2\x80\x99s probably bigger than the other.\nPenny: Is it possible you might not actually want to meet someone?\nSheldon: You are truly wise.\nPenny: Thank you.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99d say wise beyond your years, but you\xe2\x80\x99re getting up there.\nPenny: All right. Come on. What is really going on with you?\nSheldon: Penny, I am going to tell you a story that I\xe2\x80\x99ve never told anyone.\nPenny: All right.\nSheldon: I was 13 years old, and on spring break from college.\nPenny: Not relating. Go on.\nSheldon: I came home early because they ran out of math to teach me.\nPenny: Oh, now I\xe2\x80\x99m with ya. Okay.\nSheldon: My mother was at bible study. I walked in the house expecting to find it empty, and I heard a sound coming from my parents\xe2\x80\x99 bedroom. When I opened the door, I saw my father having relations with another woman.\nPenny: Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s awful.\nSheldon: I know. It\xe2\x80\x99s also why I never open a door without knocking three times. I mean, the first\none\xe2\x80\x99s traditional, but two and three are for people to get their pants on.\nPenny: Well, what happened with your dad?\nSheldon: We locked eyes, I ran to my room, and we never, ever spoke of it.\nPenny: You poor thing.\nSheldon: Since Amy and I have been living together, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been bickering like my parents used to.\nPenny: And you\xe2\x80\x99re afraid you\xe2\x80\x99re gonna do something like your dad did?\nSheldon: Yes. I need to prepare her now to save her from pain down the road.\nPenny: Down the road? Sheldon, she wanted to share a toothbrush holder with you, and now you\xe2\x80\x99re at an ice cream parlour trying to pick up women.\nSheldon: Well, anything can sound silly when you put it in that tone.\nPenny: Honey, instead of worrying about pain you might cause in the future, how about trying to fix the pain you\xe2\x80\x99re causing her right now?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you\xe2\x80\x99re right. I suppose I should apologize to you, as well.\nPenny: Okay.\nSheldon: That must have hurt watching me look for other women without ever even considering you. Please understand that I think of you as more of a nanny.\nPenny: Just finish your ice cream so I can get you home to bed.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s house.\nRaj: I wonder if this is what it feels like to be Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s baby.\nStuart: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s baby doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have a Jacuzzi jet hitting just the right spot.\nHoward: Those jets are for my secret spot, not his.\nBernadette: What do you do in there?\nHoward: It\xe2\x80\x99s called relaxing, and that\xe2\x80\x99s all you need to know.\nRaj: Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s getting late. Maybe we should head home.\nStuart: Yeah, you\xe2\x80\x99re probably right.\nRaj: You coming?\nStuart: Yeah, just give me a minute.\nRaj: Why?\nStuart: Well, you know how you\xe2\x80\x99re wearing a bathing suit?\nRaj: Yeah?\nStuart: I kind of went the other way.\nHoward: You jackasses just bought yourselves a hot tub!\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: What do you think?\nAmy: It\xe2\x80\x99s a nice enough spot. You know, if I\xe2\x80\x99m going to start standing up for myself, this is exactly the kind of thing\xe2\x80\xa6\nPenny: We\xe2\x80\x99re back.\nAmy: Oh, hi. Hi.\nSheldon: Hello.\nLeonard: How you guys doing?\nPenny: We\xe2\x80\x99re doing good. I think Sheldon has something he would like to say to Amy.\nSheldon: I wanted to apologize for my behaviour today. It, it was unnecessary. This is warm. Oh, and also, I am willing to forego the bathroom schedule.\nAmy: Oh. Really?\nLeonard: Why does she get that? We never got that.\nPenny: Do you want him back?\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m very happy for you.\nSheldon: Amy, you should know I was never really interested in seeing other women. And to prove how serious I am about us, I\xe2\x80\x99m willing to take our relationship to the next level.\nScene: Amy and Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s bathroom.\nSheldon: Amy Farrah Fowler, will you share this toothbrush holder with me?\nAmy: I would love to.\nLeonard: Did we really need to be here for this?\nPenny: Call me crazy, but I found it moving.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
