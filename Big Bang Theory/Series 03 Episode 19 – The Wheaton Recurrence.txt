b'Scene: Leonard and Penny are in Penny\xe2\x80\x99s bed.\nPenny: Having a little trouble catching your breath there?\nLeonard: No, no, I\xe2\x80\x99m good. If my P.E. teachers had told me this is what I was training for, I would have tried a lot harder.\nPenny: Do or do not. There is no try.\nLeonard: Did you just quote Star Wars?\nPenny: I believe I quoted Empire Strikes Back.\nLeonard: Oh, my God. I\xe2\x80\x99m lying in bed with a beautiful woman who can quote Yoda. I love you, Penny.\nPenny: Oh. Oh. Thank you.\nLeonard: You\xe2\x80\x99re welcome. I just wanted to put that out there.\nPenny: Oh, yeah, no, I, I\xe2\x80\x99m, I\xe2\x80\x99m glad.\nLeonard: Good. Glad is good.\nPenny: Yeah. Yeah. No, no. Um. So, it\xe2\x80\x99s getting pretty late. We should probably go to sleep.\nLeonard: Yeah.\nPenny: Okay.\nLeonard: Yeah.\nPenny: Hmm.\nLeonard: Yeah, probably.\nPenny: Okay, good night, sweetie.\nLeonard: Good night.\nCredits sequence\nScene: The apartment.\nHoward: Hey, Leonard, where do you come down on giant ants?\nRaj: Sheldon says impossible. Howard and I say not only possible, but as a mode of transportation, way cooler than a Batmobile.\nSheldon: You are ignoring the square-cube law. The giant ant would be crushed under the weight of its own exoskeleton. And for the record, the appropriate ranking of cool modes of transportation is jet pack, hoverboard, transporter, Batmobile, and then giant ant.\nLeonard: Seriously? You have nothing better to do than sit around and discuss the possibility of giant ants?\nHoward: What\xe2\x80\x99s with him?\nSheldon: Perhaps he\xe2\x80\x99s at a sensitive point in his monthly cycle.\nHoward: Are you saying he\xe2\x80\x99s man-struating?\nSheldon: Not literally. But as far back as the 17th century, scientists observed a 33-day fluctuation in men\xe2\x80\x99s hormone levels.\nRaj: Interesting. That might explain my weepy days in the middle of the month. You know what I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about.\nScene: The comic book store.\nHoward: Okay, forget giant ants. How about giant rabbits?\nRaj: Big or small, I don\xe2\x80\x99t like rabbits. They always look like they\xe2\x80\x99re about to say something, but they never do.\nSheldon: Rabbits do have a respiratory system that would support great size. And on a side note, they are one of the few mammals whose scrotum is in front of the penis.\nRaj: Maybe that\xe2\x80\x99s what they want to talk about.\nHoward: Leonard, where do you stand on giant rabbits and scrotal position?\nLeonard: I honestly don\xe2\x80\x99t care.\nRaj: Really? Because every time we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about unusual animal genitals, you\xe2\x80\x99ve always had some pretty strong and controversial opinions.\nLeonard: What do you want from me? I just don\xe2\x80\x99t give a rat\xe2\x80\x99s ass.\nHoward: Would that be a giant rat\xe2\x80\x99s ass?\nSheldon: For the record, giant rats are possible.\nLeonard: Can we please talk about something else? Maybe something vaguely related to life as we know it on this planet?\nHoward: Okay, how about this for a topic, why is Leonard being a giant douche? Assuming giant douches are possible.\nSheldon: Of course they are. Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s being one.\nRaj: Maybe he\xe2\x80\x99s having a lover\xe2\x80\x99s spat with Penny.\nLeonard: No, there was no spat.\nHoward: Oh, but something happened.\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to talk about it.\nSheldon: But I sense you\xe2\x80\x99re going to and I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to hear about it. Excuse me.\nHoward: What\xe2\x80\x99d you do, Romeo? You pour maple syrup all over your body and ask her if she was in the mood for a short stack?\nRaj: Did you think it would be funny to put on a pair of her panties and jump around, but it wound up just creeping her out?\nLeonard: What? No.\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99m just asking, dude. It happens.\nStuart: You guys still on for bowling tonight?\nSheldon: Oh, yes. In fact, I\xe2\x80\x99ve prepared some trash talk for the occasion. You bowl like your mama. Unless, of course, she bowls well. In which case, you bowl nothing like her.\nStuart: Oh. Ouch.\nSheldon: That is what is referred to as a burn on you.\nHoward: Did you ask her to start waxing?\nLeonard: No.\nRaj: Did you start waxing?\nLeonard: No.\nHoward: While making love, did you accidentally spank your own ass and cry out Mommy?\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m walking away from you now.\nHoward: That wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a no.\nRaj: Yeah, I think we\xe2\x80\x99re getting close.\nScene: The stairwell.\nHoward: Did you take a Benadryl and fall asleep while pleasuring her? Because you can die that way.\nRaj: Oh, that would be a good way to go.\nPenny: Hi.\nLeonard: Oh, hey.\nSheldon: Good, Penny, reminder, bowling tonight at seven o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\nPenny: Oh, right, bowling.\nLeonard: You don\xe2\x80\x99t have to come if you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to.\nPenny: No, no, it\xe2\x80\x99s okay. I mean, let\xe2\x80\x99s face it, you guys would get creamed without me.\nSheldon: We would indeed. In this particular case, your lack of femininity works to our advantage.\nPenny: It\xe2\x80\x99s always nice chatting with you, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Sarcasm?\nPenny: Thinly veiled contempt.\nSheldon: Remember, seven o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\nPenny: Got it.\nSheldon: Pacific Daylight time!\nPenny: Bite me!\nSheldon: Please reserve that butch spirit for the lanes.\nScene: The bowling alley.\nHoward: I thought you were bringing your own bowling shoes.\nSheldon: These are my own bowling shoes.\nHoward: Then what\xe2\x80\x99s with the disinfectant?\nSheldon: I know where my feet have been.\nStuart: Hey, Penny! And you guys. Albino Bob couldn\xe2\x80\x99t make it, so I brought a substitute. I believe some of you know Wil Wheaton.\nWil: Hi, Sheldon. How\xe2\x80\x99s it going?\nSheldon: Well, well, well. If it isn\xe2\x80\x99t Wil Wheaton, the Green Goblin to my Spider-Man, the Pope Paul the fifth to my Galileo, the Internet Explorer to my Firefox.\nWil: You\xe2\x80\x99re not still carrying a grudge because I beat you at that card tournament, are you?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m the proud owner of Wil Wheaton stinks dot com, dot net, and dot org. What does that tell you?\nWil: It tells me that I am living rent-free right here (pointing at Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s head). You ready to bowl?\nSheldon: Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m ready. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if Stuart told you what you\xe2\x80\x99re up against tonight, but before you stands the co-captain of the East Texas Christian Youth Holy Roller Bowling League championship team. Seven to twelve year-old division. Also, Penny\xe2\x80\x99s pretty good.\nWil: Great. Then it\xe2\x80\x99s on.\nSheldon: Oh, foolish Wil Wheaton, it was never off.\nTime lapse.\nWil: Yes!\nSheldon: A common spare. The Miss Congeniality of the bowling pageant. Before you jump on Twitter to tout your modest accomplishment, watch how it\xe2\x80\x99s really done. I am the ball. My thoughts are its thoughts. Its holes are my holes. (Gets a strike) Yes. Tweet that, Tweety Bird.\nHoward: Hey, I just wanted to tell you I\xe2\x80\x99m a big fan.\nWil: Oh, thanks.\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you\xe2\x80\x99re probably sick of Star Trek questions, but, Whoopi Goldberg, you ever hit that?\nRaj: Ah, beer. The magic elixir that can turn this poor, shy Indian boy into the life of the party. Oh, yeah.\nLeonard: Chilli cheese fry?\nPenny: Yes. I love chilli cheese fries.\nLeonard: Really? You love them?\nPenny: Yeah, why?\nLeonard: No reason. I\xe2\x80\x99m just glad to hear you\xe2\x80\x99re comfortable saying you love something.\nPenny: Do you really want to get into this right now?\nLeonard: Get into what? Why wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you love the chilli cheese fries? They\xe2\x80\x99ve been in your life a long time. They make you happy. They deserve to know.\nPenny: Okay, look, you just caught me by surprise last night. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what to say.\nLeonard: Okay, well, now you\xe2\x80\x99ve had some time to think about it. So, what do you want to say?\nPenny: I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure.\nLeonard: How can you not be sure?\nPenny: Okay, this isn\xe2\x80\x99t the place to have this conversation.\nLeonard: No, the place to have the conversation was in bed after I said, I love you, and you said, Thank you, good night.\nPenny: Don\xe2\x80\x99t push it, Leonard.\nLeonard: I am not pushing anything.\nPenny: You are. You don\xe2\x80\x99t get to decide when I\xe2\x80\x99m ready to say I love you!\nRaj: Ah, the premature I love you.\nHoward: I guessed premature. Does that count?\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment door.\n  Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Penny, (knock, knock, knock) Penny, (knock, knock, knock) Penny.\nPenny: What?\nSheldon: This is for you.\nPenny: Ice cream?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99ve been familiarizing myself with female emotional crises by studying the comic strip Cathy. When she\xe2\x80\x99s upset, she says Ach and eats ice cream.\nPenny: Um, Ach.\nSheldon: If you were a cat, I would have brought you a lasagna.\nPenny: Did Leonard send you over here?\nSheldon: No, we haven\xe2\x80\x99t spoken since your abrupt departure last night caused us to forfeit to Stuart and his dastardly ringer Wil Wheaton.\nPenny: Yeah, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry about that.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m not too proud to admit that I cried myself to sleep.\nPenny: Again, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.\nSheldon: And let me tell you sleep did not come easily with Leonard in the next room singing along with Alanis Morrisette.\nPenny: You\xe2\x80\x99re kidding.\nSheldon: No. Clearly another woman in dire need of ice cream.\nPenny: All right, Sheldon, what part of this is supposed to make me feel better?\nSheldon: The part where I tell you I\xe2\x80\x99ve engineered a rematch with Stuart\xe2\x80\x99s team for tonight.\nPenny: Oh, honey, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Things are a little weird with Leonard right now.\nSheldon: You want me to remove him from the team? I\xe2\x80\x99m the captain, I can do that.\nPenny: No, no, that\xe2\x80\x99s okay. Just let me talk to him, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll get back to you.\nSheldon: When are you going to talk to him?\nPenny: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\nSheldon: He\xe2\x80\x99s in the laundry room now. Now would be a good time.\nPenny: You\xe2\x80\x99re not gonna leave me alone until I do it, are you?\nSheldon: Oh, I think we both know the answer to that question.\nScene: The laundry room.\nPenny: I think we should talk now.\nLeonard: What? No, it\xe2\x80\x99s okay. We don\xe2\x80\x99t have to talk \xe2\x80\x99cause there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to talk about. Everything\xe2\x80\x99s good.\nPenny: Really? So, you didn\xe2\x80\x99t get all snarky \xe2\x80\x99cause I said something nice to a bowl of chilli fries?\nLeonard: All right, maybe I overreacted. So we\xe2\x80\x99re in two different places emotionally. So what? And maybe I\xe2\x80\x99m a little ahead of you. That\xe2\x80\x99s fine. You know. In fact, it makes sense, \xe2\x80\x99cause let\xe2\x80\x99s face it, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been in this relationship two years longer than you.\nPenny: Look, Leonard, you have to know how much I care about you. It\xe2\x80\x99s just that I\xe2\x80\x99ve said the L word too soon before, and it didn\xe2\x80\x99t work out very well.\nLeonard: Really? I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t know what that\xe2\x80\x99s like.\nPenny: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. You know what I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about, though.\nLeonard: Yeah, I do.\nPenny: So, we\xe2\x80\x99re good?\nLeonard: Yes, that\xe2\x80\x99s what I\xe2\x80\x99m telling you. We are good. We are great.\nSheldon: All right! Fence mended, problem swept under the rug. Time to bowl! Yes, I was eavesdropping, there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot at stake here.\nScene: The bowling alley.\n  Sheldon: Attention, all bowlers. I\xe2\x80\x99ve taken the liberty of having these made for our rematch.\nPenny: The Wesley Crushers?\nSheldon: No, not the Wesley Crushers. The Wesley \xe2\x80\x9cCrushers.\xe2\x80\x9d\nPenny: I don\xe2\x80\x99t get it.\nLeonard: Wesley Crusher was Wil Wheaton\xe2\x80\x99s character on Star Trek.\nPenny: Still don\xe2\x80\x99t get it.\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s a blindingly clever play on words. By appropriating his character\xe2\x80\x99s name and adding the S, we imply that we we\xe2\x80\x99ll be the crushers of Wesley.\nPenny: Okay, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, honey, but the Wesley Crushers sounds like a bunch of people who like Wesley Crusher.\nSheldon: What? No! Again, it\xe2\x80\x99s not the Wesley Crushers. It\xe2\x80\x99s the Wesley \xe2\x80\x9cCrushers.\xe2\x80\x9d\nHoward: You know, if you want it to mean you\xe2\x80\x99re crushing Wesley, it\xe2\x80\x99d be the \xe2\x80\x9cWesley\xe2\x80\x9d Crushers.\nSheldon: Do you people even hear yourselves? It\xe2\x80\x99s not the Wesley Crushers. It\xe2\x80\x99s not the \xe2\x80\x9cWesley\xe2\x80\x9d Crushers. It\xe2\x80\x99s the Wesley \xe2\x80\x9cCrushers.\xe2\x80\x9d\nWil: Hey, look. They named their team after me.\nSheldon: No, it\xe2\x80\x99s not the\xe2\x80\xa6 Never mind.\nStuart: So, we\xe2\x80\x99re all clear on the bet and the stakes?\nSheldon: Oh, yes. The losers will be publicly humiliated in a fashion to be chosen by the victor. FYI, I plan on having you publish a scientific paper expounding the discredited Velikovsky hypothesis.\nStuart: Ouch again.\nWil: Hey, Sheldon, I just wanted you to know that I\xe2\x80\x99m really looking forward to wiping the floor with you.\nSheldon: Oh, yes? Well, before I respond, let me ask you a question. Is your mother a good or poor bowler?\nTime lapse.\n  Wil: After you.\nSheldon: No, after you, as we are currently crushing you, Wesley.\nWil: It\xe2\x80\x99s customary for the player on the right-hand lane to bowl first.\nSheldon: All right.\nWil: It\xe2\x80\x99s a custom, not a rule.\nSheldon: I so loathe you.\nWil: That\xe2\x80\x99s right, Sheldon. Embrace the dark side.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s not even from your franchise!\nStuart: I, um, I want you to know that even though we\xe2\x80\x99re on opposite sides, I, I bear you no ill will.\nPenny: Thank you, Stuart. It\xe2\x80\x99s nice to know.\nStuart: Mmm, mmm. People from opposite sides often have good relationships. You know, Romeo and Juliet, Tony and Maria from West Side Story, what\xe2\x80\x99s-his-name and the big blue chick in Avatar. I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna bowl now.\nSheldon: Be the ball, Howard.\nHoward: Leave me alone, Sheldon.\nSheldon: You weren\xe2\x80\x99t the ball.\nPenny: Hey, thanks.\nLeonard: This is fun, huh?\nPenny: Yeah.\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s good that we got out and did something physical.\nPenny: Mm-hmm.\nLeonard: Gets us out of our heads. You get in your head, you start to overthink, overanalyze, obsess, you worry. That\xe2\x80\x99s not what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing tonight. Tonight we\xe2\x80\x99re just throwing a ball at some pins.\nPenny: Yeah, that\xe2\x80\x99s right.\nLeonard: Mm-hmm, and someday, we don\xe2\x80\x99t know when, maybe you\xe2\x80\x99ll love me back. Ooh, I\xe2\x80\x99m up.\nAll (chanting): Shel-don! Shel-don! Shel-don! Shel-don!\nSheldon: Excuse me. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know who you\xe2\x80\x99re chanting for as I am currently the ball.\nAll (chanting): The ball! The ball! The ball! The ball! The ball! The ball!\nSheldon: Thank you, Jesus! As my mother would say.\nWil: I\xe2\x80\x99m glad you patched things up with your boyfriend.\nPenny: Oh, yeah, me, too.\nWil: It\xe2\x80\x99s always tough when the L bomb gets dropped and you\xe2\x80\x99re not ready for it.\nPenny: Tell me about it.\nWil: I dated this one girl, and I told her that I loved her, and she said she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure. And she strung me along for almost two years. It was brutal.\nPenny: Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.\nWil: Thanks. Yeah, I wish she had just broken up with me right there, put me out of my misery.\nPenny: Really?\nWil: Yeah, would have been kinder.\nStuart: Wil, you\xe2\x80\x99re up.\nWil: Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s me.\nSheldon: Did you let Wil Wheaton get in your head?\nPenny: What are you talking about?\nSheldon: He\xe2\x80\x99s evil. He plays evil mind games. Did he tell you his grandmother died?\nPenny: No!\nSheldon: Well, if he does, don\xe2\x80\x99t believe it. He\xe2\x80\x99s not above playing the dead meemaw card.\nWil: Yes!\nSheldon: Enjoy the accolades now, Wil Wheaton, but like your time on Star Trek: Next Generation, your smug self-satisfaction will be short-lived.\nLeonard: Penny, you\xe2\x80\x99re up.\nSheldon: All right, remember, his meemaw\xe2\x80\x99s alive and be the ball.\nPenny: Yeah, I got it.\nLeonard: We really need a strike here.\nPenny: I know.\nLeonard: So just take your time and concentrate.\nPenny: Leonard, stop pressuring me.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m not pressuring you.\nPenny: Yeah, you are! Just back off!\nLeonard: Okay, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. I\xe2\x80\x99ll shut up.\nPenny: I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean shut up.\nLeonard: Fine. Just tell me what to do, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll do it.\nPenny: No, this isn\xe2\x80\x99t fair to you, Leonard. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.\nSheldon: Wait! Where are you going? Penny, come back! I\xe2\x80\x99ll get you ice cream!\nLeonard: No, let her go.\nSheldon: Are you insane? If she leaves, it\xe2\x80\x99s over!\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m pretty sure it\xe2\x80\x99s already over.\nWil: Tough luck, Sheldon.\nSheldon: You did this, didn\xe2\x80\x99t you?\nWil: Do you think I would really break up a couple just to win a bowling match?\nSheldon: No, I suppose not.\nWil: Good. Keep thinking that.\nSheldon: Wheaton!\nScene: The comic book store.\nStuart: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, yeah, I\xe2\x80\x99m telling you the Match.com chicks are much looser than on eHarmony. You know, I, I gotta call you back. I won a bet, and it\xe2\x80\x99s time to collect.\n(The guys enter dressed as female superheroes. Howard is Batgirl, Sheldon is Wonder Woman, Leonard is Supergirl and Raj is Catwoman.)\nRaj: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know about you, but I feel empowered.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
