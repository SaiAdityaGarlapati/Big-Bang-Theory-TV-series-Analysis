b'Scene: Amy\xe2\x80\x99s laboratory.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99ve invented a science joke, would you like to hear it?\nAmy: Sure.\nSheldon: How many Edisons does it take to screw in a light bulb?\nAmy: How many?\nSheldon: Who cares? He stole the idea and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t deserve his own joke.\nAmy: Is that really true?\nSheldon: Of course, that\xe2\x80\x99s how you know it\xe2\x80\x99s a good joke. It not only entertains, it informs.\nBarry: Hey, sowwy to intewupt.\nSheldon: Uh, Barry, uh, how many Edisons does it take to screw in a light bulb?\nBarry: Did you know Edison didn\xe2\x80\x99t actuawy invent the wight bulb?\nSheldon: What do you want, Barry?\nBarry: Just wanted to dwop this off as a wittle thank you for Amy.\nAmy: What\xe2\x80\x99s this for?\nBarry: Your idea weawy hewped me out. My wight-cone quantization paper\xe2\x80\x99s onwine alweady. The wesponse has been amazing.\nAmy: Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s fascinating. I can\xe2\x80\x99t wait to read it.\nSheldon: Oh, no, me as well. Uh, please e-mail it to Sheldon at bazinga dot biz. Why dot biz? Because I just gave you the business. And also bazinga dot com was taken.\nBarry: Anyway, thanks again. Cooper, suck eggs.\nSheldon: Since when do you help out Barry Kripke?\nAmy: Well, I\xe2\x80\x99d been thinking about a cellular automata approach to neuronal connectivity, and I thought it might have some interesting applications to string theory, it\xe2\x80\x99s not a big deal.\nSheldon: Oh, really? When I was doing string theory and hit a dead end, why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you try to help me?\nAmy: I did. You said the only math biologists know is if you have three frogs and one hops away, that leaves two frogs.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s pretty funny, that does sound like me. But that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that you should be standing on street corners handing out your math to whatever guy comes along.\nAmy: Sheldon, we\xe2\x80\x99re all scientists. I helped out a fellow colleague. You\xe2\x80\x99re being petty.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m being petty? You know Barry and I have a professional rivalry. You heard him, he told me to suck eggs. If we were friends, he would have suggested I suck something more pleasant. Why are you laughing? Did you learn something?\nCredits sequence.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nHoward (on phone): Okay, Ma. Say hi to Aunt Gladys. Yeah, I love you, too. Bye.\nBernadette: Your mom having fun in Florida?\nHoward: Mmm, she loves it. She finally found a place where everyone talks about how sweaty they are. Anyway, she wants us to go to the house and check in on Stuart because he might be lonely.\nBernadette: She\xe2\x80\x99s just being nice.\nHoward: Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m her son, how come she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t send someone to check on me if I\xe2\x80\x99m lonely?\nBernadette: Because you have a wife.\nHoward: Yeah, well, sometimes you work late.\nBernadette: I know you don\xe2\x80\x99t like Stuart being in the house, but the store\xe2\x80\x99s about to reopen, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure he\xe2\x80\x99ll get back on his feet.\nHoward: That would be great. I\xe2\x80\x99d love for things between me and Mom to get back to normal.\nBernadette: Well, normal\xe2\x80\x99s a strong word, but sure.\nScene: The laundry room.\nPenny: Hey.\nSheldon: Hello.\nPenny: You okay?\nSheldon: If I was okay, I would\xe2\x80\x99ve said hello, and not the much more ominous hello.\nPenny: What\xe2\x80\x99s going on?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m mad at Amy.\nPenny: Did she leave pit stains in your favourite crop top, too?\nSheldon: No. She helped Barry Kripke make an advancement in string theory.\nPenny: Oh, that sounds like a good thing.\nSheldon: Well, it would be, except that I left string theory because I decided it was a dead end. Yeah, and then she went behind my back to help someone else prove me wrong. My rival, no less. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry you had to see that.\nPenny: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry I didn\xe2\x80\x99t have a camera.\nSheldon: Why would she do this to me?\nPenny: Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure she didn\xe2\x80\x99t upset you on purpose. Besides, aren\xe2\x80\x99t you the one who says there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing more important than the advancement of science?\nSheldon: No, I said there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing more important than me advancing science.\nPenny: All right, well, if I\xe2\x80\x99m understanding this right, and all she did was help out another scientist, I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking you might have to let this one go.\nSheldon: Ugh, let it go. I have heard that my whole life. Every time something upsets me somebody says, let it go, you know, like it\xe2\x80\x99s my fault, and it\xe2\x80\x99s not okay to feel the way I feel.\nPenny: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to tell you. I mean, why don\xe2\x80\x99t you talk to her?\nSheldon: Is that all you have? Shopworn tidbits like talk to her and let it go? Gee, Penny, life\xe2\x80\x99s giving me lemons. What should I do?\nPenny: Well, you could shove them somewhere.\nSheldon: Okay, now you\xe2\x80\x99re getting creative.\nScene: The comic book store.\nStuart: Thanks again for your help.\nLeonard: No problem.\nRaj: Our pleasure.\nLeonard: The place really looks great.\nRaj: Yeah, you should have burned it down years ago.\nStuart: I keep telling you I didn\xe2\x80\x99t burn it down.\nLeonard: We know, we know, because burning something down for the insurance money is a crime.\nBernadette: Stuart, this place looks amazing.\nStuart: Thanks.\nHoward: You really did a nice job.\nStuart: And thank you for putting up with me staying at your mom\xe2\x80\x99s through all this. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have done it otherwise.\nHoward: I appreciate that, and I\xe2\x80\x99m glad you were able to\xe2\x80\xa6 is that my mother\xe2\x80\x99s furniture?\nStuart: Yeah, she said I could use it. Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it look great?\nHoward: Not as great as it looks in the den where it belongs.\nBernadette: Howie.\nHoward: Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you just clean out the whole room? Take the string art clown I made her in third grade and the ribbon I got in swim class for putting my face in the water.\nStuart: What is your problem? She said it was okay.\nHoward: Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m her son, and I say it\xe2\x80\x99s not okay.\nStuart: Some son, looks like you spent ten minutes on that clown art.\nHoward: Well, maybe I should\xe2\x80\x99ve gone to a fancy art school like you. Then I could run a failed comic shop and mooch off some guy\xe2\x80\x99s mother.\nBernadette: Why don\xe2\x80\x99t we leave so you can cool off?\nStuart: I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a good idea. Take him out of my store.\nHoward: Your store? My mother gave you the money to reopen. I\xe2\x80\x99m not going anywhere.\nLeonard: Why don\xe2\x80\x99t we go get the food for the party.\nStuart: Thank you.\nRaj: Smart, looks like we\xe2\x80\x99re being helpful.\nLeonard: Mmm, when really we\xe2\x80\x99re just exiting an uncomfortable situation.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nSheldon: Kripke, you know, of all the people, Barry Kripke. I\xe2\x80\x99m so\xe2\x80\xa6 Are you folding that like a crazy person to get me to do it for you?\nPenny: No.\nSheldon: Oh, give me that. Just out of curiosity, if I were to let something go, how would I do that?\nPenny: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, just think about something else.\nSheldon: Can I think about the spiny anteater?\nPenny: Sure.\nSheldon: The spiny anteater never went behind my back and worked with Barry Kripke. That didn\xe2\x80\x99t help at all.\nPenny: You know, some people try visualization.\nSheldon: How does that work?\nPenny: Okay, imagine your problems are a pen.\nSheldon: Okay.\nPenny: Now imagine you\xe2\x80\x99re holding that pen.\nSheldon: Okay.\nPenny: Now open your hand and let it go.\nSheldon: But I just got this pen. It\xe2\x80\x99s got my initials on it and everything. Look.\nPenny: Sheldon, this isn\xe2\x80\x99t that hard.\nSheldon: I may have a better way that you can teach me.\nPenny: How?\nSheldon: What if I told you that over the past few months Amy has secretly been giving you little puzzles to test your intelligence against chimpanzees in her lab?\nPenny: What? She didn\xe2\x80\x99t give me any puzzles.\nSheldon: Are you sure?\nAmy (in flashback): Boy, I just can\xe2\x80\x99t seem to get these scissors back together. Can you do it?\nAmy (in flashback): Darn it. There\xe2\x80\x99s something in my eye, and I need to sort these coins by size. Can you help?\nAmy (in flashback): Penny? I really want to eat this banana, but it\xe2\x80\x99s stuck inside this bamboo puzzle box.\nPenny: Son of a bitch.\nSheldon: Okay, that\xe2\x80\x99s great. Now, let it go.\nPenny: I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe you were testing me against a chimp.\nSheldon: Well, excuse me, Amy was testing you. I was rooting for you. Good job on that banana box, by the way.\nPenny: Why would she even do this?\nSheldon: She\xe2\x80\x99s been conducting an experiment on apes where they\xe2\x80\x99re given various puzzles to solve. I was surprised at the complexity of the puzzles and thought some humans wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be able to solve them. That\xe2\x80\x99s when Amy said, want to make this interesting?\nPenny: Make this interesting? You bet money on me?\nSheldon: No, no. We designed an experiment involving you. See? Now, isn\xe2\x80\x99t that interesting?\nPenny: It\xe2\x80\x99s not interesting. It\xe2\x80\x99s incredibly insulting.\nSheldon: Okay, maybe this will help. Imagine you\xe2\x80\x99re holding a pen. Before you go too far, not a special pen with your initials engraved on it, that\xe2\x80\x99ll make the next part really hard.\nPenny: Oh, my, that\xe2\x80\x99s it. Get out.\nSheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand why you\xe2\x80\x99re mad at me. You should be mad at Amy. Like I was this afternoon. Hey, look at that, I let it go.\nPenny: Get out.\nSheldon: Penny?\nPenny: What?\nSheldon: I think I left my pen in there.\nScene: The comic book store.\nBernadette: I understand why you\xe2\x80\x99re upset, but he worked really hard to get the store ready. And it\xe2\x80\x99s just furniture.\nHoward: It\xe2\x80\x99s my mom\xe2\x80\x99s furniture. It belongs in the house I grew up in, next to that pile of TV Guides and in plain view of what, for a ten-year-old, was a quality piece of string art.\nBernadette: Howie, if the store succeeds, Stuart has a source of income, and he can move out of your mother\xe2\x80\x99s house. Seems like some old furniture is a reasonable price to pay for that.\nHoward: That is a good point. But I didn\xe2\x80\x99t marry you for good points. I married you to blindly support me no matter how ridiculous I\xe2\x80\x99m being.\nBernadette: This is why I had to rewrite our wedding vows.\nScene: A deli.\nLeonard: Hi, we\xe2\x80\x99re here to pick up an order for Comic Center.\nWaitress: Sure, let me go check on that.\nRaj: Dude, I, I think that\xe2\x80\x99s Nathan Fillion.\nLeonard: Oh yeah, look at that.\nRaj: And he\xe2\x80\x99s picking the tomatoes out of his salad just like I do. I always did feel a connection with him. Oh, I have got an idea.\nLeonard: We\xe2\x80\x99re not selling his tomatoes on eBay.\nRaj: No, if we got Captain Reynolds from Firefly to do a signing at Stuart\xe2\x80\x99s store, that would be amazing.\nLeonard: That would be great.\nRaj: So should we go talk to him?\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I mean, if he\xe2\x80\x99s not nice, it\xe2\x80\x99s gonna make it hard for me to watch him in anything again.\nRaj: What? The, the guy who plays Jon Snow was a jerk. We still watch Game of Thrones.\nLeonard: He was a jerk because you rear-ended him.\nRaj: I was distracted. It\xe2\x80\x99s weird seeing a member of the Night\xe2\x80\x99s Watch with a kayak strapped to his car. Come on. Hi, excuse me, s, sorry, I, I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to bother you, but we\xe2\x80\x99re just really big fans of Firefly. And Dr. Horrible.\nNathan Fillion: Oh, uh, I think you made a mistake. I\xe2\x80\x99m not an actor.\nRaj: Don\xe2\x80\x99t say that. I mean, you\xe2\x80\x99re not Dame Judi Dench, but you\xe2\x80\x99re pretty great.\nNathan Fillion: Oh, yeah, I get it, you think I\xe2\x80\x99m Nathan Fillion, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not. So if you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind, I would just love to eat my lunch.\nLeonard: Come on. Sorry to bother you.\nRaj: Don\xe2\x80\x99t know why he\xe2\x80\x99s so grumpy. I got mistaken for that guy in Life of Pi once, and I\xe2\x80\x99m still floating.\nScene: The hallway.\nAmy: Sheldon, it\xe2\x80\x99s me.\nPenny: Oh, hey. Did you see that? I, I figured out how to open the door all by myself. Maybe I\xe2\x80\x99ll fling some faeces around my cage to celebrate.\nAmy: What are you talking about?\nPenny: I know you\xe2\x80\x99ve been giving me secret puzzle tests.\nAmy: Sheldon, open the door.\nSheldon: I can\xe2\x80\x99t. I\xe2\x80\x99m naked.\nAmy: I just saw you.\nSheldon: Hang on.\nPenny: Open the door now.\nAmy: Oh, hey.\nPenny: Pull up your pants.\nAmy: It\xe2\x80\x99s not a big deal. I run tests like this on undergrads all the time. If you fill out some paperwork at the university, I can get you five dollars.\nPenny: I don\xe2\x80\x99t want five dollars. I want my dignity.\nAmy: So what are we talking, like, ten bucks?\nScene: The deli.\nLeonard: Thank you.\nRaj: Thanks.\nLeonard: Sorry again.\nNathan Fillion: No problem.\nRaj: Are you sure you\xe2\x80\x99re not him? Uh, you can tell us. We\xe2\x80\x99re scientists, not crazy fanboys.\nNathan Fillion: All right, fine. I\xe2\x80\x99m him.\nRaj: And you\xe2\x80\x99re eating alone at a deli. I don\xe2\x80\x99t buy it, you\xe2\x80\x99re not him.\nNathan Fillion: I just wanted to eat my lunch in peace. But I really am him. And thank you very much for being a fan. If you want, uh, let\xe2\x80\x99s take a picture.\nLeonard: That would be great.\nRaj: Great.\nLeonard: Yeah, thank you.\nNathan Fillion: You bet.\nRaj: Wait, hang on. If you\xe2\x80\x99re really Nathan Fillion, what\xe2\x80\x99s the line from Firefly about your bonnet?\nNathan Fillion: I swear by my pretty floral bonnet, I will end you.\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99s it, that\xe2\x80\x99s the line.\nRaj: Although, I knew the line, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make me Nathan Fillion.\nNathan Fillion: Do you want the picture or not?\nRaj: I want a picture with Nathan Fillion.\nNathan: How about a picture with a guy who looks like Nathan Fillion but a little more annoyed than Nathan Fillion usually is?\nLeonard: What do you think?\nRaj: Ah, it\xe2\x80\x99s good enough for Facebook.\nScene: The comic book store.\nLeonard: I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe they did that.\nPenny: I know, it\xe2\x80\x99s so insulting. At one point, they had me figure out how to get a banana out of a puzzle box.\nLeonard: Wait, Sheldon gave me a banana in a box. He was testing me, too.\nPenny: Unbelievable.\nLeonard: And how could a chimp even solve that? That was impossible.\nPenny: Really? You couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get it out?\nSheldon: Thank you.\nAmy: Wow, the store looks great.\nLeonard: So you guys were testing us both? What is the matter with you?\nPenny: Eh, what\xe2\x80\x99s the matter with them is they think they\xe2\x80\x99re so smart they don\xe2\x80\x99t care if they hurt other people\xe2\x80\x99s feelings.\nAmy: That\xe2\x80\x99s not true.\nSheldon: That sounds like us. I still don\xe2\x80\x99t understand why you\xe2\x80\x99re upset. You solved every puzzle faster than all of the chimps.\nAmy: Well, except Barnabas, but he was on Adderall.\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, but it\xe2\x80\x99s making me crazy.\nBernadette: Can you please just let it go?\nSheldon: Oh, I can help you with that. Imagine you\xe2\x80\x99re holding an ordinary pen. While your favourite pen is safe and secure in your pocket.\nHoward: Hold that thought. (On phone) Hello?\nAmy: How can I make this up to you?\nPenny: The answer\xe2\x80\x99s in this puzzle box. Let\xe2\x80\x99s see if you can open it.\nStuart: You could have at least warned him about the furniture.\nRaj: That\xe2\x80\x99s what I said when we moved it.\nBernadette: You helped him?\nRaj: No, Stuart picked out those throw pillows all on his own.\nLeonard: Hey, you okay?\nHoward: No.\nLeonard: What\xe2\x80\x99s wrong?\nHoward: My mom died.\nBernadette: What?\nHoward: Uh, that was my aunt. Ma took a nap. She never woke up.\nBernadette: Oh, my God, Howie.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m so sorry.\nRaj: What can we do?\nHoward: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\nSheldon: May I say something?\nLeonard: Not right now, Sheldon.\nSheldon: But I think it would be comforting.\nLeonard: Buddy.\nHoward: No, it\xe2\x80\x99s okay. What?\nSheldon: When I lost my own father, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t have any friends to help me through it. You do.\nPenny: I really thought he was gonna say let it go.\nScene: The apartment.\nRaj (on phone): Okay, thanks, Bernadette. Travel safe. Okay, bye. Well, they\xe2\x80\x99ve booked a flight. They\xe2\x80\x99re heading to the airport now.\nPenny: How\xe2\x80\x99s Howard holding up?\nRaj: He\xe2\x80\x99s hanging in there.\nLeonard: How are you doing, Stuart?\nStuart: Still can\xe2\x80\x99t believe she\xe2\x80\x99s gone. I mean, that woman took me in. If it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t for her, I, I would have been homeless.\nAmy: One of us would have taken you in.\nStuart: Yeah, I don\xe2\x80\x99t recall any offers. But, you know what, uh, I, I\xe2\x80\x99m glad it worked out the way it did because I got to know this wonderful person.\nRaj: Yeah. Mrs. Wolowitz was pretty special. When I first moved to America, Howard was my only friend and she made me feel so welcome in her home. Which says a lot, because, those first few years, she thought I was the gardener.\nPenny: Whenever I saw her, she\xe2\x80\x99d say I was too skinny and try and feed me.\nAmy: She did that to me, too.\nPenny: Don\xe2\x80\x99t take this away from me.\nSheldon: I didn\xe2\x80\x99t care for her yelling. But now that I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to hear it again, I\xe2\x80\x99m sad.\nLeonard: If you want, I can yell at you later.\nSheldon: It won\xe2\x80\x99t be as good.\nLeonard: Let\xe2\x80\x99s have a toast. To Mrs. Wolowitz. A loving mother to all of us. We\xe2\x80\x99ll miss you.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
