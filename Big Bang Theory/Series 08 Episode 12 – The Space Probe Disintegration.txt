b'Scene: The apartment.\nSheldon: What colour would you like to be?\nLeonard: Well, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to be green, but you know you always take it.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s not true. Any colour\xe2\x80\x99s fine with me. Yeah, I could be a-a combination of blue and yellow.\nLeonard: Blue and yellow make green.\nSheldon: Well, then it\xe2\x80\x99s settled.\nPenny: Hi. Ready to go?\nSheldon: Oh, good news, we ordered lunch, so we can all stay here and play Lord of the Rings Risk.\nAmy: Sheldon, we said that we would play games with you tonight.\nSheldon: Oh, no, we\xe2\x80\x99ll still be playing it tonight, this game can easily take eight hours.\nPenny: Sweetie, you really thought I\xe2\x80\x99d want to do this?\nLeonard: No.\nPenny: Well, did you tell him that?\nLeonard: Yes.\nPenny: Did you say it out loud with words?\nLeonard: No.\nPenny: I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to spend the whole day playing a board game.\nSheldon: Yeah, well, you may change your mind when you hear that this is the new expanded edition which contains a more complete map of Middle Earth, now including the Haradwaith Territories.\nAmy: I will literally race you to the car.\nLeonard: No, no, no, come on, don\xe2\x80\x99t leave. Just try it.\nPenny: No. We\xe2\x80\x99re always doing what you guys want. Just once, it\xe2\x80\x99d be nice if you did something we wanted.\nSheldon: You want to be green?\nLeonard: You know, they really have tried to like a lot of the same stuff we\xe2\x80\x99re into.\nPenny: Yeah, we do game nights and video game nights and we watch movies with director\xe2\x80\x99s commentary.\nAmy: Oh, my favourite, George Lucas can talk all the way through Star Wars, I say one word and I\xe2\x80\x99m banished to the kitchen.\nPenny: Yeah, today Amy and I are deciding what we\xe2\x80\x99re all gonna do.\nLeonard: You got it, you girls are in charge.\nPenny: Thank you.\nAmy: Sheldon?\nSheldon: Fine. Now that we\xe2\x80\x99re not playing, you can be green.\nLeonard: Thank you.\nSheldon: And since you\xe2\x80\x99re green this time, I can be it next time.\nPenny: All right, let\xe2\x80\x99s see. What\xe2\x80\x99s something fun the guys would never take us to do? Oh, I know, we could go horseback riding.\nAmy: I actually can\xe2\x80\x99t. My hips don\xe2\x80\x99t open wider than 22 degrees. I rode a very thin pony once. On the first bump, just popped right off.\nPenny: All right, well, what do you want to do?\nAmy: There\xe2\x80\x99s a craft and folk art museum on Wilshire.\nPenny: Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s Wilshire\xe2\x80\x99s problem. Come on, you know, there, there\xe2\x80\x99s got to be something fun we could do that the guys will hate.\nLeonard: Hang on, why do we have to hate it?\nPenny: Three words, Doctor Who convention.\nLeonard: I did not force you to go to that.\nPenny: You walked out of the house in a fez and bow tie. I went so you didn\xe2\x80\x99t get beat up.\nLeonard: I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t gonna get beat up.\nPenny: You were, but somehow I held myself back.\nSheldon: You know what you could make us do? Ice-skating. The cold air will trigger Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s asthma and it plays right into my well-known fear of getting flattened by a Zamboni.\nLeonard: Now you\xe2\x80\x99re helping them find ways to make us miserable?\nSheldon: Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, Leonard, I\xe2\x80\x99m a problem-solver, it\xe2\x80\x99s what I do.\nAmy: I actually can\xe2\x80\x99t go ice-skating. I have unnaturally brittle ankles.\nPenny: Is there any part of your body that\xe2\x80\x99s normal?\nCredits sequence.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nRaj: Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God.\nHoward: Will you please relax?\nRaj: I can\xe2\x80\x99t take it, dude.\nBernadette: You okay?\nRaj: No, I\xe2\x80\x99m not okay. I feel like I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna jump out of my skin.\nBernadette: I told you not to wax down there. It\xe2\x80\x99s itchy when it grows back.\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99m worried about the New Horizons space probe.\nBernadette: What\xe2\x80\x99s he talking about?\nHoward: Nine years ago he was part of a team that launched a spacecraft to collect data about Pluto, and it\xe2\x80\x99s finally close enough, so this morning it turned itself on.\nRaj: We hope. The signal has to travel over three billion miles. So it\xe2\x80\x99s gonna be hours before we know if it even survived.\nHoward: Now we get to see him flip out because he\xe2\x80\x99s worried it was demolished by space ice.\nRaj: Space ice is no joke. I can\xe2\x80\x99t even watch Frozen anymore.\nScene: The apartment.\nAmy: Ooh, the philharmonic is playing Beethoven downtown.\nSheldon: Before you say yes, it\xe2\x80\x99s not the movie about the big dog.\nPenny: How come we can\xe2\x80\x99t think of something we both want to do?\nAmy: Because you always pick what we do and I just go along with it.\nLeonard: Ah, interesting, we\xe2\x80\x99re being accused of making you do things you don\xe2\x80\x99t like, and here you are, doing the same thing to poor Amy.\nSheldon: You should point out the hypocrisy of that.\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99s what I was doing.\nSheldon: Oh, that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t clear. Try it again, but this time drive it home with how do you like them apples, Missy?\nPenny: All right, keep thinking.\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re making it too complicated. Why not stick to the basics? Go shopping for clothes while Leonard and I sit in those uncomfortable chairs and hold your purses, hmm? I know I\xe2\x80\x99d hate that. Leonard?\nLeonard: Well, yeah.\nSheldon: Well, then, it\xe2\x80\x99s settled?\nAmy: What do you say? Sounds kind of perfect.\nPenny: It does, somehow he managed to take all the fun out of it.\nSheldon: Well, once again, it\xe2\x80\x99s what I do.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nRaj: Oh, another two hours to go. The wait is killing me.\nHoward: I know. I get it. When I was in the Soyuz capsule returning from the space station, plummeting toward Earth at 17,000 miles per hour\xe2\x80\xa6\nRaj: Before you finish, is this a story about patience and waiting or just another reminder that you went to space?\nHoward: A story can do two things.\nRaj: Ugh, I feel like I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna have a heart attack.\nHoward: You work in pharmaceuticals, don\xe2\x80\x99t you have anything you can give him?\nBernadette: All I have is our new urine flow drug. Won\xe2\x80\x99t help with his anxiety, but it\xe2\x80\x99s so strong, when he pees he\xe2\x80\x99ll fly around the room like he\xe2\x80\x99s got a jet pack.\nRaj: I can\xe2\x80\x99t stop thinking about it.\nBernadette: You know, worrying won\xe2\x80\x99t have any effect on what happens.\nRaj: I know.\nHoward: Maybe you need to do something more productive.\nRaj: Okay. If I make this shot in the trash can, the probe will have arrived in perfect working order.\nHoward: So, in addition to being crazy, you\xe2\x80\x99re resting the fate of the mission on your athletic prowess.\nRaj: Yes.\nHoward: The man who crashed his stationary bike.\nRaj: I didn\xe2\x80\x99t crash it, okay? My playlist was too up-tempo, I got light-headed and I fell off. Okay. It all comes down to this.\nHoward: You happy? Now you can relax.\nRaj: What kind of scientist are you? Everyone knows you got to make two out of three.\nScene: A clothes shop.\nLeonard: This isn\xe2\x80\x99t so bad.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s easy for you to say. Your chair\xe2\x80\x99s not facing the lingerie section. Boy, that\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of panties.\nAmy: You guys comfy? This might take a while.\nSheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand why women insist on making a big production out of buying clothes.\nPenny: No, you\xe2\x80\x99re right, we should do what you do. Have our mom send us pants from the Walmart in Houston.\nSheldon: They have a man there who understands my personal style.\nPenny: Bye.\nLeonard: Uh, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got some bad news. There\xe2\x80\x99s no cell service in here.\nSheldon: Oh. Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s all right. There were plenty of ways to pass the time before smart phones were invented.\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99s true.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99ll look them up. Son of a biscuit.\nLeonard: Sheldon, it\xe2\x80\x99s fine.\nSheldon: No, it\xe2\x80\x99s not fine. What kind of store in the 21st century doesn\xe2\x80\x99t at least have Wi-Fi? I\xe2\x80\x99m going to call their corporate office. Son of a biscuit.\nScene: The same, later.\nSheldon: Let\xe2\x80\x99s see, my armies are going to attack the Shire from Buckland. And I roll a five and a three.\nLeonard: Okay. And to defend, I roll two sixes. I win.\nSheldon: Boy, double-sixes again. You know, if I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t seen it with my own eyes, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t believe it. I wonder how long we\xe2\x80\x99re gonna be stuck here.\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, but the girls do a lot for us. It\xe2\x80\x99s the least we can do.\nSheldon: Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s true. I suppose it\xe2\x80\x99s only fair we make compromises.\nLeonard: Look at you, being all mature.\nSheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why you\xe2\x80\x99re so surprised. If there\xe2\x80\x99s one thing I know about after living with you for so many years, it\xe2\x80\x99s how to compromise.\nLeonard: I, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry? You make compromises for me?\nSheldon: All the time.\nLeonard: On Earth? In our lives? That, that, that we\xe2\x80\x99re living?\nSheldon: Oh, yes. I, just yesterday, you had a, a big piece of lettuce stuck in your teeth at lunch. Did I say anything? No. I compromised and kept my mouth shut. Like you should\xe2\x80\x99ve, because everyone was laughing at you.\nLeonard: That is not a compromise. A compromise is me driving you everywhere because you refuse to learn how.\nSheldon: Oh, I learned how. Amy taught me.\nLeonard: What? Then. then why don\xe2\x80\x99t you do it?\nSheldon: Uh, well, it\xe2\x80\x99s scary. And sometimes I get the pedals mixed up. But, more importantly, driving me to work is one of the things that gives your life purpose. I can\xe2\x80\x99t take that away from you, so what do I do? Oh, come on, I\xe2\x80\x99m practically feeding you the answer. I compromise.\nScene: Raj\xe2\x80\x99s car.\nRaj: Hey, uh, thanks for keeping me company.\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to. I think getting out of the apartment will do you good. So, where we headed?\nRaj: If it\xe2\x80\x99s okay with you, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to go to temple.\nHoward: Buddy, trust me, you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to convert to Judaism. I mean, I know I make it look cool, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not all briskets and dreidels.\nRaj: I meant a Hindu temple.\nHoward: Oh. Okay. It\xe2\x80\x99s not like Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, right? Some bald guy with horns isn\xe2\x80\x99t gonna rip my heart out.\nRaj: Dude, that movie\xe2\x80\x99s an imperialist fantasy that makes the followers of a beautiful and peaceful religion look like a bunch of bloodthirsty barbarians.\nHoward: You love that movie.\nRaj: Yeah, it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty great.\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m surprised to see you suddenly get religious.\nRaj: Why?\nHoward: Well, because I\xe2\x80\x99ve known you for ten years and you\xe2\x80\x99ve never gone to temple, you never talked about believing in God, and last Diwali I watched you eat two pounds of sacred cow at a Brazilian steak house.\nRaj: Religion is a very personal thing. I do go to temple, I just, I don\xe2\x80\x99t talk about it.\nHoward: Yeah, but you\xe2\x80\x99re a scientist.\nRaj: So?\nHoward: So, as a scientist, you believe the way to understand the universe is through facts and evidence, and now you\xe2\x80\x99re counting on some blue chick with a hundred arms to help you?\nRaj: That is so offensive. Does everything you know about Hinduism come from Indiana Jones?\nHoward: No. There\xe2\x80\x99s also Apu from The Simpsons.\nRaj: Well, lots of scientists believe in God. Okay? Newton, uh, Faraday, uh, Pascal, all were believers. Even Einstein was famous for attacking quantum theory on the grounds that God does not play dice with the universe.\nHoward: Well, of course he believed in God. he slept with Marilyn Monroe.\nRaj: Actually there\xe2\x80\x99s no proof of that.\nHoward: You believe in your religion, I\xe2\x80\x99ll believe in mine.\nScene: The store changing rooms.\nAmy: How\xe2\x80\x99s it going in there?\nPenny: Uh, not really a great outfit for work, unless something opens up in the hookers and whores division. Hey, can I ask you something?\nAmy: Sure.\nPenny: Do I really force you to do things you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to?\nAmy: Yeah, but it\xe2\x80\x99s okay.\nPenny: How is it okay?\nAmy: I promised myself, if I ever got friends, I\xe2\x80\x99d do whatever they said. Really, I\xe2\x80\x99m lucky you found me before a cult did.\nPenny: Well, you know, that was a long time ago. You\xe2\x80\x99re a different woman now. You\xe2\x80\x99re smart, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got great friends, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got a boyfriend, you\xe2\x80\x99re pretty, you have zero fashion sense, but, anyway, tonight we\xe2\x80\x99re gonna do whatever you want.\nAmy: Really?\nPenny: Absolutely. You name it, we\xe2\x80\x99re doing it.\nAmy: Basket weaving at the craft museum.\nPenny: Well, you named it.\nScene: The store.\nSheldon: Oh, here\xe2\x80\x99s another one. I wish that the apple pancake mix was on the top shelf because it starts with an A, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t put it there because I don\xe2\x80\x99t want you breaking one of your little legs when you\xe2\x80\x99re supposed to be making my breakfast.\nLeonard: Is it my turn to talk about the compromises I make?\nSheldon: I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t done, but go ahead. He said, compromising.\nLeonard: Because of you, I\xe2\x80\x99m not allowed to adjust the temperature in my own home. I\xe2\x80\x99m not allowed to whistle. I don\xe2\x80\x99t wear shoes that might squeak.\nSheldon: Well, you\xe2\x80\x99re a physicist, not a circus clown.\nLeonard: Sheldon, do you realize I don\xe2\x80\x99t live with the woman I love because of you? No other reason. Just you.\nSheldon: Is that true?\nLeonard: Yes, it\xe2\x80\x99s true. The last time I brought it up, you had an emotional breakdown and got on a train and ran away.\nSheldon: Well, given my history on the subject, t seems a little reckless to bring it up now.\nLeonard: You have no idea how much you inconvenience the lives of everyone around you. It\xe2\x80\x99s exhausting.\nSheldon: You know what? You think you\xe2\x80\x99re so tolerant, but the truth is you\xe2\x80\x99re mean to me a lot. Yeah, you think that I don\xe2\x80\x99t notice all those sarcastic comments and those eye rolls, but I do. Hmm? I have excellent peripheral vision. On a good day, I can see my ears.\nLeonard: Sheldon, I, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry if I hurt your feelings. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been holding a lot of this in for a while.\nSheldon: Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, too. And if you want to live with Penny, then I think you should.\nLeonard: Do you mean that?\nSheldon: Yes. Yeah, just put on your squeaky shoes and eee-eee-eee your way out of my life.\nLeonard: Come on, don\xe2\x80\x99t get upset.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m not upset. I\xe2\x80\x99m just imagining a world without my best friend in it.\nLeonard: Sheldon.\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s okay.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m not leaving your world. I\xe2\x80\x99m just talking about living across the hall.\nSheldon: I understand. Either way, I want you to know that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of how difficult I can be. So I just want to say thank you for putting up with me.\nLeonard: Buddy.\nPenny: How are you guys getting along? What? Why are there tears?\nLeonard: Everything\xe2\x80\x99s fine. We just started talking about living arrangements.\nAmy: Are you crazy? You know he\xe2\x80\x99s a flight risk.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what I told him.\nPenny: Sheldon, we know this is a sensitive subject, and Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s not gonna move out until you\xe2\x80\x99re ready.\nSheldon: Well, what if you did it gradually?\nLeonard: All right. How about we start with two nights a week I live with Penny?\nSheldon: How about one night and I let you whistle?\nLeonard: Okay.\nSheldon: When I\xe2\x80\x99m not home.\nLeonard: You got it.\nSheldon: There we go, compromising again. We really are the best.\nScene: The temple car park.\nHoward: Here we go, my first Hindu temple.\nRaj: You see behind the fountain, that tower that looks like a pyramid? It\xe2\x80\x99s called a Sikhara. It symbolizes the, the connection between the human and the divine.\nHoward: Huh. I always thought it was mini golf.\nRaj: All right. Shall we?\nHoward: Yeah. Just, uh, is there anything I should know before I go in?\nRaj: Like what?\nHoward: Like am I dressed okay?\nRaj: Really? So every other place you\xe2\x80\x99ve been, you thought this was fine?\nHoward: I know you\xe2\x80\x99re under a lot of pressure, so I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna let that pass.\nRaj: Sorry. You\xe2\x80\x99re right. I\xe2\x80\x99m so stressed. But you know what, whenever I walk into that temple I realize that whatever happens, it\xe2\x80\x99s okay. We\xe2\x80\x99re all part of an immense pattern, and though we can\xe2\x80\x99t understand it, we can be happy to know that it\xe2\x80\x99s, it\xe2\x80\x99s working its will through us.\nHoward: That\xe2\x80\x99s nice.\nRaj: Whether you call it God or the universe or the self, we\xe2\x80\x99re all interconnected, and that\xe2\x80\x99s just a beautiful\xe2\x80\xa6 Son of a bitch, that guy just dinged my car. S, seriously? You were just gonna drive away? Like my life isn\xe2\x80\x99t hard enough right now. A space probe might be destroyed, my parents are going through an awful divorce, the guy who cuts my dog\xe2\x80\x99s hair just gave her bangs.\nHoward: Raj.\nRaj: You saw her. She looks like Jim Carrey from Dumb and Dumber.\nHoward: Raj, you just got a text. The probe turned on. It\xe2\x80\x99s fine.\nRaj: Oh, good. Namaste, Grandpa.\nScene: The craft museum.\nLeonard: I thought this was gonna be boring, but it\xe2\x80\x99s actually kind of fun.\nPenny: Don\xe2\x80\x99t tell Amy that. We\xe2\x80\x99ll be here every Sunday.\nAmy: Sheldon, that really is an excellent basket.\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s not a basket. It\xe2\x80\x99s a soldier\xe2\x80\x99s helmet from 16th century China.\nAmy: Very nice.\nLeonard: Yeah, it looks great.\nSheldon: I saw that.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom.\nLeonard: Well, roomie, it\xe2\x80\x99s only one night a week, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a start.\nPenny: I know. I\xe2\x80\x99m really proud of Sheldon.\nLeonard: Yeah, I\xe2\x80\x99m proud of him, too.\nSheldon (in Penny\xe2\x80\x99s living room): Can you keep it down? Some of us are trying to sleep out here.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
