b'Scene: The apartment.\nPenny: So, Bernadette, how goes the hunt for bridesmaid dresses?\nBernadette: Well, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind looking like an orange traffic cone, great.\nAmy: Girlfriends, I have the answer to our dress problems.\nBernadette: Really?\nAmy: Twelve years ago, my cousin Irene and her entire family died in a horrific carbon monoxide accident the night before her wedding.\nBernadette: That\xe2\x80\x99s horrible.\nAmy: Yes and no. All those bridesmaids dresses remain unused and available to us for free. So it seems that cloud of odourless deadly gas had a silver lining after all. Check it out, still in the bags. The gowns, not the bridesmaids.\nBernadette: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Dead people\xe2\x80\x99s dresses?\nPenny: Yeah, and cap sleeves? U-u-uh.\nAmy: Uh, I was hoping you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t notice. Irene was always a slave to a good bargain when it came to clothes, and sadly as it turned out, space heaters.\nSheldon: Ladies, please. These four walls once housed an intellectual salon where the mind received nourishment as well as the stomach. But through no one\xe2\x80\x99s fault, Penny, the quality of dinner conversation in this apartment has declined. And again, I\xe2\x80\x99m looking at no one in particular, Penny.\nLeonard: Fine. What would you like to talk about, Sheldon?\nHoward: What would you like to talk about, Sheldon? Why do you hate us?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99ve prepared a number of topics that should appeal to both the advanced and novice conversationalists.\nPenny: Okay, that time you looked at me.\nAmy: Who didn\xe2\x80\x99t? Your skin is like alabaster. Do you even have pores?\nSheldon: Topic one. Faster-than-light particles at CERN, paradigm-shifting discovery or another Swiss export as full of holes as their cheese? And converse.\nPenny: All right, who wants to go to my apartment and look at bridal magazines?\nBernadette: Oh, me.\nPenny: Through no one\xe2\x80\x99s fault, Sheldon, we\xe2\x80\x99re leaving.\nAmy: Wait for moi.\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re leaving?\nAmy: Sheldon, sometimes you forget, I\xe2\x80\x99m a lady. And with that comes an oestrogen fuelled need to page through thick glossy magazines that make me hate my body.\nSheldon: Ah. New topic. Women, delightfully mysterious or bat-crap crazy?\nRaj: Totally. What\xe2\x80\x99s wrong with cap sleeves? If you have the right figure for it, they\xe2\x80\x99re adorable.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The cafeteria.\nLeonard: Hey, Amy, what brings you to our neck of the woods?\nAmy: Your neurology department loaned me a culture of prions for my research on bovine spongiform encephalopathy.\nSheldon: She popped by to borrow a cup of mad cow disease.\nAmy: It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to make degenerative brain maladies hilarious, and yet somehow you do it.\nHoward: That\xe2\x80\x99s fun to have in a lunchroom.\nAmy: The real fun starts when you get to pick the rat you\xe2\x80\x99re going to feed it to, and maybe you choose the beady-eyed little mother who\xe2\x80\x99s been biting you all week.\nHoward: Please, we\xe2\x80\x99re eating. Can we get that off the table and change the subject?\nSheldon: Can we? Stand back while I turn this conversation into a conver-sensation.\nLeonard: This time, it\xe2\x80\x99s your fault.\nSheldon: I have 100 alphabetized topics from artichoke, come on, people, it\xe2\x80\x99s just a giant thistle, to zzz, the onamona-poetry of sleep.\nLeonard: Amy, how long would it take for that mad cow disease to kill me?\nAmy: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, four or five years.\nLeonard: No, it\xe2\x80\x99s not gonna do it.\nHoward: Oy. Bernadette keeps texting me pictures of Penny in bridesmaid dresses.\nAmy: They\xe2\x80\x99re out shopping right now?\nHoward: Yeah.\nAmy: Just the two of them?\nHoward: I guess.\nAmy: That\xe2\x80\x99s cool, that\xe2\x80\x99s cool.\nHoward: Why are they asking me about this stuff? What guy knows what a sweetheart neckline is? (Raj raises his hand)\nScene: The apartment. Leonard is horseracing on a Kinnect game.\nLeonard: Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s coming down the home stretch! Come on, horsey, you can do this! Damn. Come on, thigh muscles, you can do this! Yes! First place. I would have been a great jockey if I weren\xe2\x80\x99t too tall. And scared of horses. Sheldon, you\xe2\x80\x99re up.\nSheldon: What?\nLeonard: Come on, it\xe2\x80\x99s your turn. We said we\xe2\x80\x99d get more fresh air.\nSheldon: Sorry. I\xe2\x80\x99m a little distracted. I can\xe2\x80\x99t seem to get in touch with Amy. I tried e-mail, video chat, tweeting her, posting on her Facebook wall, texting her, nothing.\nLeonard: Did you try calling her on the telephone?\nSheldon: The telephone. You know, Leonard, in your own simple way, you may be the wisest of us all. Voice mail. Curiouser and curiouser.\nLeonard: If you\xe2\x80\x99re worried, we can go over there and see if she\xe2\x80\x99s all right.\nSheldon: Okay. You know, I heard in the news a bobcat has been spotted in her neighbourhood.\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t think Amy was eaten by a bobcat.\nSheldon: Who thinks Amy was eaten by a bobcat?\nLeonard: You do?\nSheldon: Leonard, I was just mentioning an interesting local news item. Now, thanks to you, I\xe2\x80\x99m worried Amy\xe2\x80\x99s been eaten by a bobcat.\nLeonard: Forget about the bobcat.\nSheldon: How can I? You won\xe2\x80\x99t stop talking about it.\nScene: Amy\xe2\x80\x99s apartment. Amy is playing the harp.\nAmy (singing): Everybody hurts, sometimes everybody cries. Everybody hurts, sometimes.\nSheldon (outside): She sounds weepy. I don\xe2\x80\x99t like weepy. Let\xe2\x80\x99s go.\nLeonard: Uh, she\xe2\x80\x99s your friend. Step up.\nLeonard: (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. Bye.\nSheldon: Where are you going?\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m single, I don\xe2\x80\x99t need this crap.\nAmy: Sheldon, what are you doing here?\nSheldon: You didn\xe2\x80\x99t respond to any of my electronic communications.\nAmy: I wanted to be alone.\nSheldon: Would you like to talk about it? And keep in mind that no is a perfectly viable answer.\nAmy: Sheldon, my world is crumbling around me.\nSheldon: Point of order. As you\xe2\x80\x99re in distress, it would be customary for me to offer you a hot beverage. But I\xe2\x80\x99m a guest in your home, so it would be customary for you to offer me a beverage. How do you want to proceed vis-a-vis beverages?\nAmy: It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter. Nothing matters.\nSheldon: If you\xe2\x80\x99d like to take your mind off what\xe2\x80\x99s troubling you, uh, word on the street is a bobcat has been spotted.\nAmy: Penny and Bernadette went shopping for bridesmaids dresses without me.\nSheldon: And that made you feel sad?\nAmy: Yes.\nSheldon: I knew it. Just keep going, I guess I\xe2\x80\x99m good at this.\nAmy: It\xe2\x80\x99s just, I thought they liked hanging out with me, but I guess I was fooling myself.\nSheldon: When they were over here, did you fail to offer them a beverage? \xe2\x80\x98Cause I can see how that could stick in someone\xe2\x80\x99s craw.\nAmy: Sheldon, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to ask you something, and I\xe2\x80\x99d like you to keep an open mind.\nSheldon: Always.\nAmy: At this moment, I find myself craving human intimacy and physical contact.\nSheldon: Oh, boy. You know ours is a relationship of the mind.\nAmy: Proposal. One wild night of torrid lovemaking that soothes my soul and inflames my loins.\nSheldon: Counterproposal. I will gently stroke your head and repeat, aw, who\xe2\x80\x99s a good Amy.\nAmy: How about this? French kissing, seven minutes in heaven culminating in second base.\nSheldon: Neck massage, then you get me that beverage.\nAmy: We cuddle. Final offer.\nSheldon: Very well. Oh, boy. (They cuddle, awkwardly.)\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99m just saying, second base is right there.\nScene: The cafeteria.\nRaj: Mm, I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking about adopting some quirky affectation, like a pipe or a monocle or a handlebar moustache.\nLeonard: For all those girls out there looking for the Indian Monopoly man?\nRaj: This is not a safe place. You can\xe2\x80\x99t share anything here.\nSheldon: The two of you need to get your women in line!\nHoward: What?\nSheldon: Last night I was strong-armed into an evening of harp music and spooning with an emotional Amy Farrah Fowler. This on a night that I had originally designated for solving the space-time geometry in higher-spin gravity and building my Lego Death Star. And why? Your gal pals, Penny and Bernadette, went out shopping for some wedding nonsense without Amy, an action they took with no thought or regard as to how it would affect me, the future of string theory or my Lego fun time.\nHoward: What do you want us to do about it?\nSheldon: You clearly weren\xe2\x80\x99t listening to my topic sentence, get your women in line! You make them apologize to Amy and set things right. I am a man of science, not someone\xe2\x80\x99s snuggle bunny!\nLeonard: Why do I have to talk to Penny? She\xe2\x80\x99s not my girlfriend.\nSheldon: You invited her to lunch four years ago. Everything about her is on you, you make it so!\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: Moo-shu is Penny.\nPenny: Thank you. Where\xe2\x80\x99s Sheldon?\nLeonard: Oh, he was up late last night, so I gave him an early dinner and put him to bed.\nBernadette: That\xe2\x80\x99s so sweet.\nLeonard: Yeah, but now he\xe2\x80\x99s gonna be up at dawn and want to play.\nHoward: So, listen, guys, the reason he was up late is because he was taking care of Amy. She\xe2\x80\x99s kind of upset.\nPenny: Why?\nLeonard: Her feelings got hurt because you guys went dress shopping without her.\nBernadette: I told you that would happen.\nPenny: Okay, look, this is her first time being a bridesmaid and she\xe2\x80\x99s just getting a little crazy with it.\nBernadette: She keeps on telling us stories about bridesmaid traditions in other cultures, and they\xe2\x80\x99re all about getting naked and washing each other.\nPenny: Yeah, and she keeps trying to figure out if our cycles have synced up so we can call ourselves the Three Menstra-teers\nBernadette: We thought it would be easier to look at dresses one time without her. I feel terrible.\nPenny: I know. Me, too. We\xe2\x80\x99ll talk to her. Hey, wait, how did she find out?\nHoward: Raj did it. And he says he would do it again. Okay, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. You sent me the picture, I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t thinking.\nBernadette: Oh, Howie.\nHoward: Well, hey, I\xe2\x80\x99m usually pretty good at not blabbing. You tell me tons of stuff about these guys, and I never repeat it.\nPenny: What do you tell him?\nBernadette: Oh, you know, just pillow talk. You guys have nothing to worry about.\nLeonard: Hold on, did you talk about us when we were dating?\nPenny: No. All your little secrets are fine.\nBernadette: Yes, absolutely fine.\nHoward (after Raj whispers to him): I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you later.\nScene: Amy\xe2\x80\x99s lab. Amy is dissecting a brain.\nAmy: Come on, tumour. Come on, tumour, Mama needs an aggressive little glioblastoma. Yay, brain tumour! Probably not the same reaction you had when you got the news.\nPenny: Hi.\nBernadette: Hello.\nAmy: What are you doing here?\nPenny: Well, look, we just wanted to apologize for not bringing you with us the other day.\nAmy: That\xe2\x80\x99s not necessary, it\xe2\x80\x99s like Sesame Street says, one of these things is not like the other, one of these things should die alone.\nPenny: Look, come on, Amy, look, let us make it up to you. We\xe2\x80\x99ll have a girl\xe2\x80\x99s night, we\xe2\x80\x99ll do whatever you want.\nBernadette: We can go down to the Korean baths and do that thing you were talking about where we wash each other.\nPenny: With-with loofah mitts, no hands.\nAmy: It\xe2\x80\x99s okay. I\xe2\x80\x99m glad this happened. I can stop pretending that some beautiful girl and her cute-in-\nthe-right-light friend want to hang out with me.\nBernadette: Amy, we\xe2\x80\x99re really sorry.\nPenny: Yeah, we feel awful.\nAmy: Don\xe2\x80\x99t. I\xe2\x80\x99ll be okay. You\xe2\x80\x99re not the first girls I thought were friends with me who ended up shunning me. It\xe2\x80\x99s like elementary school, junior high, high school, undergrad, grad school, and that semester abroad in Norway all over again.\nPenny: Oh, come on, Amy.\nAmy: You don\xe2\x80\x99t get it. Look at this brain.\nPenny: I don\xe2\x80\x99t really want to.\nAmy: This is us. Bernadette, you are the analytical, scientific left hemisphere. Penny, you\xe2\x80\x99re the creative, spontaneous right hemisphere. And where\xe2\x80\x99s Amy? She\xe2\x80\x99s right here, the sad little tumour no one wants to go dress shopping with.\nBernadette: Amy, you\xe2\x80\x99re not a tumour. Penny, tell her she\xe2\x80\x99s not a tumour. (Penny is vomiting in the dustbin).\nScene: The apartment, Sheldon is building his Lego Death Star. Phone rings.\nSheldon: Did you know that when Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone, he proposed answering it with ahoy? Ahoy. I like it. Amy? Is that you? Have you been drinking? I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, I bet my sweet what? Well, all right. We\xe2\x80\x99re on our way.\nLeonard: What\xe2\x80\x99s going on?\nSheldon: It would seem Amy is drunk in a liquor store parking lot.\nLeonard: Really? Amy?\nSheldon: Leonard, be glad you can\xe2\x80\x99t keep a woman. They are a handful.\nScene: A liquor store parking lot.\nAmy: Oh, look. It\xe2\x80\x99s Sheldon and little Leonard. Hi, little Leonard.\nLeonard: Hi, Amy.\nAmy: Hey, Cuddles.\nLeonard: Cuddles?\nSheldon: Yes, Cuddles. We cuddled. Grow up, Leonard.\nLeonard: Amy, what are you doing here?\nAmy: Well, I came here to get a bottle of wine like Penny taught me to do when you\xe2\x80\x99re sad.\nLeonard: Yeah, but why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you go back to your apartment?\nAmy: Didn\xe2\x80\x99t you go to high school, Leonard? Parking lots are where all the cool kids hang out. Not that the rat bastards ever invited me.\nLeonard: Maybe we should get you home.\nAmy: Oh, hang on, hang on, hang on. Sheldon, what would it take for you to go into that liquor store, buy a bottle of hooch, take me across the street to that motel, and have your way with me?\nLeonard: Yeah, Sheldon, what would it take?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m begging both of you, please, let\xe2\x80\x99s go.\nLeonard: Okay. Come on. Upsy-daisy.\nAmy: Whee! Ooh, finally someone found second base.\nScene: Amy\xe2\x80\x99s lab. She is dissecting a brain.\nAmy: I know how you feel. I got a knife slicing through my frontal lobe, too.\nPenny: Hi.\nAmy: What do you want? Do you want me to give the friendship bracelet back?\nPenny: I never gave you a friendship bracelet.\nAmy: When we first met, I made one and pretended you gave it to me. You can have it back if you want.\nPenny: No, you made that for you, I want you to have it.\nBernadette: We know you\xe2\x80\x99re upset, and you have every right to be, but if it\xe2\x80\x99s okay with you, we\xe2\x80\x99d like a second chance to make things right.\nPenny: We are really sorry, and we were trying to think of some way to show you how much we care about you.\nBernadette: Which is why it would mean so much if you would agree to be the maid of honour at my wedding.\nAmy: What? Wait, is this some kind of practical joke? Like in Norway, when my friends trapped me in a sauna with a horny otter?\nBernadette: No. I, I want you to be the maid of honour.\nAmy: Oh, my gosh. No one\xe2\x80\x99s every asked me to be the maid of honour before. Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s not true. Once, but then they all died.\nBernadette: So is that a yes?\nAmy: Yes. Yes. Oh, my gosh, I, I have so much to do. There\xe2\x80\x99s the bridal shower and the bachelorette party. What should we do for the bachelorette party? Oh, I know, we\xe2\x80\x99ll go to a Native American sweat lodge, we\xe2\x80\x99ll take peyote, roll around in the mud, and paint fertility symbols on Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s naked body. So that\xe2\x80\x99s happening.\nPenny: Yeah, sure, sure. Vegas is fun, too.\nAmy: I feel like crying. Of course, I could just be hormonal. Oh, wait. Maybe our menses are finally syncing up. Bernadette? No? Penny?\nPenny: Sorry.\nAmy: Really?\nPenny: Okay, yeah.\nAmy: Yay!\nScene: A bridal store.\nAmy: Maid of honour Amy Farrah Fowler\xe2\x80\x99s amazing behind-the-scenes wedding video, take one.\nBernadette: We\xe2\x80\x99re just trying on dresses, do we really need to record this?\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, are you the maid of honour?\nBernadette: I am the bride.\nAmy: So no. And action.\nPenny (in a red bridesmaid dress): What do you think?\nBernadette: I love it!\nAmy: What are you, a nun? Come on, bestie, let\xe2\x80\x99s see some skin.\nCut to Amy in a lilac dress.\nBernadette: Oh, Amy! Looking sexy!\nAmy: You think they don\xe2\x80\x99t have mirrors in there? I know how I look.\nCut to Bernadette in a wedding dress.\nPenny: Oh! Bernadette, you look beautiful!\nAmy: You do.\nBernadette: Thank you.\nAmy: Not Penny beautiful, but beautiful.\nCut to changing room door.\nAmy: Come on, bestie, you\xe2\x80\x99re up.\nPenny (off): Give me a minute.\nAmy: What is taking you so long? (Opens door. Penny is in her underwear)\nPenny: Oh, Amy! Get the hell out of here!\nAmy: \xe2\x80\x93 Sorry, sorry. (Swings camera away. Then back again)\nPenny: Oh, God. Amy!\nAmy: Sorry.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
