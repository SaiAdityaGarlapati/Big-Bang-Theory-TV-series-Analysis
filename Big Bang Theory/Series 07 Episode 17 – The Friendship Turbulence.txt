b'Sceme: The apartment\nBernadette: Raj, your tag\xe2\x80\x99s sticking out.\nRaj: Thank you. That was the closest I\xe2\x80\x99ve come to sex in, like, two years.\nBernadette: Now I feel a little gross.\nRaj: You\xe2\x80\x99re only making it seem more real for me.\nHoward: Hey, that\xe2\x80\x99s my wife. If anyone\xe2\x80\x99s gonna make her feel gross about sex, it\xe2\x80\x99s me.\nRaj: Can we please talk about something other than my depressing love life?\nSheldon: How about Penny\xe2\x80\x99s depressing acting career?\nLeonard: Hey. I mean, it\xe2\x80\x99s been a little tough, but Penny\xe2\x80\x99s following her dreams, and in my book, that is not depressing.\nPenny: Aw, thank you.\nHoward: Is that book called Lies I Tell to Get Sex?\nRaj: Is that a real book? I would totally read that book.\nAmy: Can I borrow it when you\xe2\x80\x99re done?\nPenny: Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll have you guys know I turned down a part in a movie last week.\nLeonard: Why would you do that?\nPenny: Because it was crap. It\xe2\x80\x99s a sequel to that awful killer gorilla movie I was in.\nBernadette: Serial Ape-ist? I thought you died in that.\nSheldon: She does. 42 minutes in.\nRaj: While showering topless, 16 minutes after brief side butt during a pillow fight with her sorority sisters.\nSheldon: I have an eidetic memory. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what his problem is.\nPenny: Okay, well, there are no shower scenes in this one. They just try to clone me from my corpse, but my DNA gets mixed with the ape\xe2\x80\x99s DNA and I end up running around with giant gorilla hands and feet.\nSheldon: Am I missing something, or isn\xe2\x80\x99t that the part she was born to play?\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: So are you really not gonna do this movie?\nPenny: Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s the kind of part that\xe2\x80\x99s good for my career.\nLeonard: Well, but don\xe2\x80\x99t a lot of famous actors get their start doing bad movies?\nPenny: Okay, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think Meryl Streep ever had to say \xe2\x80\x9cMust keep gorilla hands from killing again!\xe2\x80\x9d\nRaj: If she did, it would be amazing. That woman can do no wrong.\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know anything about show business, so if you think it\xe2\x80\x99s reasonable to turn down paid work and just burn through your savings, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you know what you\xe2\x80\x99re doing.\nAmy: I think we\xe2\x80\x99re gonna go.\nSheldon: Are you sure? We were making fun of failed careers. We didn\xe2\x80\x99t get to tap the juicy vein that is Howard\xe2\x80\x99s.\nHoward: Hey, I work at the same university you do.\nSheldon: Yes, and Hawkeye\xe2\x80\x99s in the Avengers, but no one ever says help, Hawkeye.\nBernadette: Can I ask you something? Why do you constantly feel the need to put down my husband?\nPenny: Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure he does it out of love. The same way my boyfriend makes me feel terrible about my life choices.\nAmy: I think we\xe2\x80\x99re gonna go.\nLeonard: No, no, no. This is not a fight. I was just excited that someone offered you a part and a little surprised that you\xe2\x80\x99d rather sit at home and do nothing than take it. Now it\xe2\x80\x99s a fight.\nSheldon: Well, with that sorted out, I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to answer your question, Bernadette. Howard started it.\nHoward: I didn\xe2\x80\x99t do anything. I was just sitting here.\nSheldon: I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t referring to this evening. Ten years ago, upon first seeing me, your husband claimed that I looked like C-3PO and Pee-wee Herman. And he called me C-3P-wee Herman.\nRaj: Ha-a-a. Still funny.\nBernadette: That was ten years ago.\nSheldon: Nine years, 11 months and three weeks ago, he followed that up by replacing the slides for my lecture with photographs of nude fat women bending over.\nAmy: Really?\nHoward: The lecture was on cosmic gas clouds. That\xe2\x80\x99s funny.\nRaj: I was there. It was funny.\nSheldon: In any event, that began a decade-long progression of insults, pranks and unwanted magazine subscriptions. To this day, I still get a monthly copy of Granny on Granny. Which, other than its surprisingly fun puzzle page, is complete filth.\nScene: The street\nAmy: Thanks for walking me to my car.\nRaj: Actually, it\xe2\x80\x99s for both of us. Last night, I watched West Side Story, and I\xe2\x80\x99m a little freaked out by street gangs.\nAmy: Why can\xe2\x80\x99t Raj find a girl? The mystery continues.\nRaj: I don\xe2\x80\x99t appreciate your sarcasm, but we\xe2\x80\x99ve still got two blocks to go, so I\xe2\x80\x99ll put up with it.\nAmy: Whatever happened with your online dating?\nRaj: No one was writing me back, so I stopped checking my profile.\nAmy: Before I met Sheldon, I was ready to give up, too. Once, I even dropped in on my OBGYN just to get some human contact.\nRaj: It has been a while since I got my prostate checked.\nAmy: Then I met Sheldon and look at where we are now.\nRaj: What? You\xe2\x80\x99ve kissed, like, once in three years.\nAmy: That\xe2\x80\x99s true. Do whatever you want.\nScene: Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s office.\nHoward: Hey.\nSheldon: Hello.\nHoward: Listen, I was thinking you and I could probably try to be better friends.\nSheldon: Really? I was thinking what we have now is a bit much.\nHoward: Seriously, I was talking to Bernadette last night and she made some great points. You and I have known each other a long time, and I didn\xe2\x80\x99t hear the rest \xe2\x80\x99cause she took her bra off.\nSheldon: Very well. How do you propose we move forward?\nHoward: Uh, for starters, we could stop insulting each other.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s a great idea. And in the spirit of our new arrangement, I will mask my surprise that you came up with it.\nHoward: Anyway, I got invited to do a little talk at NASA in Houston this weekend. They gave me two tickets. Bernadette can\xe2\x80\x99t go. You want to come with me? You can visit your mom, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll show you around the space centre.\nSheldon: I have one question. Is this a prank where we land in Houston and you\xe2\x80\x99ve made up wanted posters that have my face with a moustache and a Spanish name and then I get arrested and deported to South America?\nHoward: No.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m glad because I would not have seen that coming.\nScene: Amy\xe2\x80\x99s lab.\nRaj: Amy, I could use some help.\nAmy: Oh. Let me guess. There\xe2\x80\x99s an undergrad in a leather jacket snapping his fingers by the water fountain.\nRaj: I thought about what you said last night, and I went back on the dating Web site and I was looking at this girl\xe2\x80\x99s profile. She\xe2\x80\x99s amazing.\nAmy: Oh, she\xe2\x80\x99s cute. And smart. Phi Beta Kappa.\nRaj: And judging by her lack of Adam\xe2\x80\x99s apple, she\xe2\x80\x99s been female her entire life. I like that in a woman.\nAmy: Great, so what do you need me for?\nRaj: Well, I was up all night trying to write to her, but I wanted to run it by you first.\nAmy: All right.\nRaj: Emily, your face is like a precious dew-kissed flower.\nAmy: Wow.\nRaj: I know. Powerful stuff, huh?\nAmy: No. You\xe2\x80\x99re supposed to be yourself, not all desperate and creepy.\nRaj: Okay, I\xe2\x80\x99m getting some mixed messages here.\nAmy: Just say something normal like, I saw your profile. Looks like we have a lot in common, let\xe2\x80\x99s get a cup of coffee sometime.\xe2\x80\x9d\nRaj: Yes. Where I can be jealous of the cup touching your ruby lips. Or you just write it for me.\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99m not gonna pretend to be you.\nRaj: I don\xe2\x80\x99t want you to pretend to be me. You can be like my, uh, online wingman. Like if we met her at a bar and you talked me up.\nAmy: Well, what would I say to her?\nRaj: Just tell her what I\xe2\x80\x99m really like. And, if you think it\xe2\x80\x99ll help, that you saw me changing once and my package reminded you of the muscular tail of a jaguar. Use your own words.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s car.\nSheldon: Thanks again for taking me to the pharmacy.\nPenny: Oh, it\xe2\x80\x99s no problem. Is everything okay?\nSheldon: Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m fine. It\xe2\x80\x99s just some, uh, stomach medication for my trip. There\xe2\x80\x99s the remote yet distinct possibility that I may end up in South America.\nPenny: Remember the old days when I would\xe2\x80\x99ve said something dumb like why? Uh, that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t sound good.\nSheldon: Remember the old days when I used to point out that your check engine light was on?\nPenny: Yes.\nSheldon: Well, get ready to stroll down memory lane. Penny, your check engine\xe2\x80\xa6\nPenny: Yeah, I know it\xe2\x80\x99s on, Sheldon. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I cannot afford this right now.\nSheldon: Maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s just something minor. Ooh, good news, the light just went out.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: Are we playing individual or teams?\nRaj: Teams are fun.\nSheldon: Oh, in that case, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to be partnered with my good friend Howard.\nRaj: But I\xe2\x80\x99m always on Howard\xe2\x80\x99s team. We\xe2\x80\x99re best friends. The kind who finish each others\xe2\x80\xa6\nHoward: I really don\xe2\x80\x99t think we do tha\xe2\x80\xa6\nRaj: Do that. See?\nPenny: Oh, hi.\nLeonard: Oh, how\xe2\x80\x99d it go at the mechanic?\nPenny: Not great. Can I talk to you for a sec?\nLeonard: Yeah, sure.\nRaj: Maybe I can go with you guys to Houston?\nHoward: Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it a little late to get plane tick\xe2\x80\xa6\nRaj: Plane tickets? Yeah.\nHoward: Will you please sto\xe2\x80\xa6\nRaj: Stop that? Okay.\nScene: The stairwell.\nPenny: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to do. My car threw a rod and it\xe2\x80\x99s totaled. I can\xe2\x80\x99t afford a new one, I have no job, and now I can\xe2\x80\x99t drive to auditions.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m so sorry. I know it\xe2\x80\x99s a sensitive subject, but can you reconsider that part in the movie?\nPenny: I did. I called them. The part\xe2\x80\x99s gone. They gave it to someone else. Now that girl\xe2\x80\x99s gonna get discovered and become famous and go on Letterman and talk about how she got her big break on a cheap monkey movie all because some dumb girl thought it was beneath her.\nLeonard: At least they talked about you on Letterman. Come on, I can drive you wherever you need to go.\nPenny: How? Unlike me, you have a job. I\xe2\x80\x99m just gonna have to go back to being a waitress, like I will be for the rest of my life.\nSheldon: Leonard, would you wrap it up? We\xe2\x80\x99re waiting on you.\nPenny: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, is the fact that my life\xe2\x80\x99s falling apart interfering with your board game?\nSheldon: It is. You were wrong, friend Howard. She completely understood.\nScene: Amy\xe2\x80\x99s lab.\nRaj: Hey, you busy?\nAmy: No. What\xe2\x80\x99s up?\nRaj: Have you heard back from Emily?\nAmy: I have.\nRaj: Great. And?\nAmy: And I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t think you\xe2\x80\x99re right for her.\nRaj: I give you one simple thing to do, contact a complete stranger and make her fall in love with me, and you blow it.\nAmy: I told her what a good guy you are, but she thought it was a bad sign that you didn\xe2\x80\x99t write to her yourself. She thought it made you seem too shy and passive.\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99m not too shy and passive. You write her back and tell her I said that. You know, when you have a second.\nAmy: Look, I\xe2\x80\x99ll see if I can change her mind tomorrow night.\nRaj: What\xe2\x80\x99s happening tomorrow night?\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99m meeting her for coffee.\nRaj: What?\nAmy: Well, we just, we e-mailed back and forth a bit, and we kind of hit it off.\nRaj: I find a girl I like, and you\xe2\x80\x99re stealing her?\nAmy: No. We just ended up having a lot in common. We went to Harvard, we like Chaucer, we\xe2\x80\x99re both hardcore into quilting.\nRaj: Your words fall like acid rain on the wounded petals of my heart.\nScene: Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s car.\nHoward: That\xe2\x80\x99s Sheldon. He says he\xe2\x80\x99ll be down in a minute.\nBernadette: What are you doing?\nHoward: Oh, he\xe2\x80\x99s not coming out until he sees proof you don\xe2\x80\x99t have an air freshener in your car.\nBernadette: This is gonna be a long weekend for you.\nHoward: You\xe2\x80\x99re the reason I\xe2\x80\x99m doing it.\nBernadette: I said to stop insulting each other. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t tell you to take him on a romantic getaway.\nHoward: How do I know what you said? Damn you and your noise-cancelling breasts.\nSheldon: Hello.\nBernadette: Hi.\nHoward: Hey, buddy.\nBernadette: You excited for Texas?\nSheldon: Oh, very much so.\nHoward: It\xe2\x80\x99s not every day you get to tour NASA with a real astronaut.\nSheldon: Oh, who\xe2\x80\x99s the real astronaut?\nHoward: Buzz Aldrin.\nSheldon: Oh. Yay.\nScene: An airplane.\nSheldon: (Tap, tap, tap) Howard? (Tap, tap, tap) Howard? (Tap, tap, tap) Howard?\nHoward: What now?\nSheldon: I have to go to the bathroom.\nHoward: You just went to the bathroom.\nSheldon: But I didn\xe2\x80\x99t use it because it didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem safe. Despite all my e-mails, the toilet didn\xe2\x80\x99t have a seatbelt.\nHoward: Well, it still doesn\xe2\x80\x99t.\nSheldon: I realize that, but safety concerns went out the window two apple juices ago.\nHoward: Fine.\nSheldon: Why are you getting annoyed?\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to be a better friend, but you constantly say and do irritating things.\nSheldon: Like when?\nHoward: When? How about in the car? I\xe2\x80\x99m an astronaut, and you know it. You just don\xe2\x80\x99t like admitting it, because you\xe2\x80\x99re jealous.\nSheldon: Well, truth be told, as a child, I did dream of going to space. Those astronauts were my heroes. And when you got to go, it was hard for me.\nHoward: Thank you.\nSheldon: Because it made me realize they\xe2\x80\x99ll just send anyone up there. Aren\xe2\x80\x99t you going to let me out?\nHoward: No.\nSheldon: But I still need to use the bathroom.\nHoward: Here you go. Be creative. What\xe2\x80\x99s the matter? Scared of a little turbulence?\nSheldon: No, turbulence is just the equalization of diurnal temperature variations in the atmosphere. I\xe2\x80\x99m not scared at all. Oh, apple juice, stay where you are.\nHoward: Oh, this is nothing. I experienced way worse when I was plummeting back to Earth, apparently not being a real astronaut. Okay, that was a big one.\nSheldon: I take it back. I\xe2\x80\x99m scared of turbulence!\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna need that bag back.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nLeonard: You sure you want to do this?\nPenny: Yeah. Why wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t I want to get my old job back? It\xe2\x80\x99ll be fun to see everyone. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t talked to them since I said I quit, see you at the Oscars, bitches. Come on, let\xe2\x80\x99s just get this over with.\nLeonard: Let\xe2\x80\x99s get this over with. Am I driving you to the Cheesecake Factory, or are we having sex? I\xe2\x80\x99m just, I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to lighten the mood.\nPenny: I know. Thank you.\nLeonard: Sorry.\nPenny: It\xe2\x80\x99s just so humiliating.\nLeonard: So humiliating? Am I driving you to the Cheesecake Factory\xe2\x80\xa6? I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. I\xe2\x80\x99ll. I\xe2\x80\x99ll stop. I\xe2\x80\x99ll stop.\nScene: Outside the building.\nLeonard: Come on, don\xe2\x80\x99t look so sad. You never know what\xe2\x80\x99s gonna happen. Maybe tonight will be great.\nPenny: Sweetie, I know you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to make me feel better, and I love you for that, but it\xe2\x80\x99s making me feel worse, and I kind of hate you. This isn\xe2\x80\x99t your car.\nLeonard: I know. I thought we\xe2\x80\x99d take yours.\nPenny: I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand.\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s nothing fancy, but it\xe2\x80\x99ll get you to auditions, and at least for now, you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to go back to waitressing.\nPenny: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to say.\nLeonard: Don\xe2\x80\x99t say anything.\nPenny: Oh, my God.\nLeonard: I mean, you could say thank you. I did just buy you a car.\nScene: A coffee shop.\nAmy: Look, I admit that it\xe2\x80\x99s odd that Rajesh didn\xe2\x80\x99t write to you himself, but if you get to know him, you\xe2\x80\x99ll see he\xe2\x80\x99s just a sweet, regular guy. As a counterpoint, here he is, uninvited and visibly sweaty.\nRaj: Hello, Emily.\nEmily: Hello.\nRaj: Amy told me you were concerned that I might be too passive and shy. Let me ask you something. Would a passive guy barge in here to look you in the eye and say, hey, dew-kissed flower, what\xe2\x80\x99s up?\nEmily: No, but a weird guy with no boundaries might.\nRaj: Uh, okay, that\xe2\x80\x99s a separate issue. Let\xe2\x80\x99s put a pin in that and just focus on the passive thing.\nEmily: I\xe2\x80\x99m leaving.\nAmy: Are we still going to go to that Chaucer reading Friday?\nEmily: You know, I think I\xe2\x80\x99m just gonna go by myself.\nRaj: Not my best first date. Yeah, but not my worst, either.\nScene: The airplane.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry for every mean thing I ever did or said to you.\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, too. It\xe2\x80\x99s all my fault.\nSheldon: If you weren\xe2\x80\x99t my friend, there\xe2\x80\x99d be a hole in my life.\nHoward: Thank you, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Kind of like when Firefly was cancelled. But not as big.\nAnnouncement: The captain has turned off the fasten seat belt sign. You\xe2\x80\x99re now free to move about the cabin.\nHoward: It\xe2\x80\x99s over.\nSheldon: Yeah.\nHoward: Should we stop holding hands now?\nSheldon: In a minute.\nHoward: Okay, good.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
