b'Scene: The apartment.\nHoward: So, how does this game work? I just throw it, like a real ball?\nLeonard: Yeah, just nice and easy, right over the plate.\nHoward: All right.\nRaj: You suck, Wolowitz.\nHoward: What\xe2\x80\x99s that about?\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99m heckling you. It\xe2\x80\x99s a beloved part of baseball.\nSheldon: He\xe2\x80\x99s right. And given that you\xe2\x80\x99re probably still waiting to be picked for a game that was played in fifth grade, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you do suck.\nPenny: Hi. What\xe2\x80\x99s going on?\nLeonard: Baseball.\nPenny: Okay, this is not what I meant when I said go outside and play.\nLeonard: He\xe2\x80\x99s practicing.\nPenny: For what?\nHoward: The Angels wanted an astronaut to throw out the first pitch, so guess who they called?\nPenny: What, you? Really?\nHoward: Well, a lot of people who weren\xe2\x80\x99t available, but then me.\nPenny: That\xe2\x80\x99s so cool. Congratulations. I guess that makes you the athlete of the group.\nSheldon: Well, not just him. May I remind you that you\xe2\x80\x99re talking to the seeker, beater, chaser and water boy of the third place Griffith Park Quidditch team.\nPenny: I know. Watching your boyfriend run around with a broomstick between his legs isn\xe2\x80\x99t something you forget.\nLeonard: C\xe2\x80\x99mon now, throw one.\nHoward: All right, here we go.\nRaj: You look like a jackass.\nHoward: Cut it out. You\xe2\x80\x99re hurting my feelings.\nLeonard: Now you know why we\xe2\x80\x99re not outside.\nScene: The stairwell.\nSheldon: Did you enjoy my lecture?\nAmy: No, and neither did our waiter.\nSheldon: Well, if you\xe2\x80\x99re going to serve Cornish game hen, you should either be familiar with the history of Cornwall or be prepared to learn it.\nAmy: It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to argue with that. And I know because I saw a sad man with a pepper mill desperately try and fail.\nPenny: Hey, how was dinner?\nSheldon: Good, I had Cornish game hen.\nLeonard: Oh, that poor waiter.\nAmy: Sheldon, how about tomorrow night we see a movie?\nPenny: You guys are going out two nights in a row?\nSheldon: I missed a number of date nights while I was on my train trip, and I\xe2\x80\x99m contractually obligated to make them up under the terms of the Relationship Agreement.\nPenny: That\xe2\x80\x99s so hot.\nAmy: It\xe2\x80\x99s better than hot, it\xe2\x80\x99s binding.\nSheldon: If you\xe2\x80\x99re free tomorrow night, I\xe2\x80\x99d love to have you join us on a double date.\nPenny: Aw.\nAmy: You are aware that a double date doesn\xe2\x80\x99t count as two dates.\nSheldon: Oh. Well, then come or don\xe2\x80\x99t. I don\xe2\x80\x99t care.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nBernadette: I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe you\xe2\x80\x99re sore.\nHoward: Hey, even professional pitchers need a rubdown after the game.\nBernadette: But they throw an actual ball. You were throwing air at a TV.\nHoward: For your information, I also gave Leonard one hell of a high five.\nBernadette: I\xe2\x80\x99m kind of surprised you agreed to do this in front of a stadium full of people.\nHoward: They\xe2\x80\x99re doing Space Day and NASA asked me. I felt like I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t say no.\nBernadette: Okay. Well, if you want, I could help you practice. I played a lot of softball growing up.\nHoward: Thank you, that would be great.\nBernadette: Great. And while we\xe2\x80\x99re at it, maybe we could butch up your run for when you head out to the mound.\nHoward: What\xe2\x80\x99s wrong with the way I run?\nBernadette; Oh, just kidding. Nothing.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nPenny: Sheldon, I\xe2\x80\x99m surprised you\xe2\x80\x99d choose to go to a pub.\nSheldon: At our committee meeting, Amy made a motion for a picnic in a park, but I tacked so many amendments on that thing it sank like a lead balloon.\nAmy: I then suggested a pub.\nSheldon: Yeah, which I was initially sceptical of until I saw online that they serve Yorkshire pudding.\nLeonard: You don\xe2\x80\x99t even like Yorkshire pudding.\nSheldon: No, it\xe2\x80\x99s yucky, but informing people about the history of Yorkshire is yummy, yum-yum.\nAmy: After a lively debate, that proposal passed by a two-zero margin.\nLeonard: Nice to see a busy couple keep the spark of bureaucracy alive.\nSheldon: Ignore them, Amy. They\xe2\x80\x99re just jealous because they\xe2\x80\x99ll never have a relationship as good as ours.\nPenny: Isn\xe2\x80\x99t this when he says bazooka or something?\nSheldon: I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t making a joke, I was merely stating fact. Amy and I have a superior relationship to yours.\nLeonard: You don\xe2\x80\x99t honestly think that, do you?\nSheldon: Leonard, I assumed you knew. The ranking of relationships in our circle by quality is me and Amy, Howard and Bernadette, Raj and his girlfriend, Penny and Chardonnay, Penny and you.\nLeonard: There isn\xe2\x80\x99t any ranking. And if there were, we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be at the bottom of it.\nPenny: Yeah, and actually, I drink Sauvignon Blanc.\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99s the part you have a problem with?\nPenny: Relax.\nAmy: There they go, fighting again. You\xe2\x80\x99d never hear her talk that way to Sauvignon Blanc.\nScene: A gymnasium.\nRaj: So you never played baseball as a kid, not even Little League?\nHoward: Well, I was going to, but the day of tryouts I found my dad\xe2\x80\x99s Playboy collection. Threw my arm out.\nBernadette: All right, the pitcher\xe2\x80\x99s mound in Major League Baseball is sixty feet, six inches away from home plate.\nHoward: Great. You take this and say when to stop. How much further?\nBernadette: Keep going.\nHoward: How about now?\nBernadette: I\xe2\x80\x99ll let you know.\nHoward: Are you saying stop and we\xe2\x80\x99re just too far away to hear you?\nBernadette: Okay, stop.\nHoward: Are you kidding me?!\nBernadette: That\xe2\x80\x99s sixty feet.\nHoward: There\xe2\x80\x99s no way this is sixty feet.\nBernadette: I\xe2\x80\x99m looking at it.\nHoward: You realize this isn\xe2\x80\x99t one of those times I want you to exaggerate how long something is.\nScene: Amy\xe2\x80\x99s car.\nLeonard: Okay, I got to, I, I, I, I got to ask. What makes you think that your relationship is so wonderful and ours isn\xe2\x80\x99t?\nSheldon: For starters, we enjoy spending time together.\nLeonard: So do we. And I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen you guys ignore each other for hours doing totally different things.\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s called parallel play.\nLeonard: Yeah, toddlers do that.\nSheldon: Not as well as we do.\nLeonard: You believe this guy? He has to be the best at everything.\nPenny: So what? Why do you even care?\nSheldon: Oh, listen to them. Not even married and the honeymoon\xe2\x80\x99s over.\nLeonard: Whatever. You can\xe2\x80\x99t even go on a date without checking your relationship agreement.\nSheldon: If you\xe2\x80\x99ve got a problem basing a relationship on a contract, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to tell you about 13 plucky colonies that entered a relationship agreement called the U.S. Constitution. And it may not be cool to say so, but I think that love affair is still pretty hot today.\nAmy: It\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing I\xe2\x80\x99m not wearing flag underwear right now, \xe2\x80\x99cause there\xe2\x80\x99s about to be a fire.\nScene: The gym.\nBernadette: Okay, it\xe2\x80\x99s not that hard. You just look to where you want to throw it, step towards where you want to throw, and throw it.\nHoward: That\xe2\x80\x99s your help? That\xe2\x80\x99s like saying here\xe2\x80\x99s how you fly a plane, get in the airplane, know where you want to go and fly it.\nBernadette: Just throw the ball. Let\xe2\x80\x99s see what we\xe2\x80\x99re working with.\nRaj: Come on Howard, fire it in.\nBernadette: Throw the damn ball!\nScene: The pub.\nAmy: So when do you guys plan on getting married?\nPenny: Uh, we\xe2\x80\x99re not sure. But I want to wait long enough to prove to my mother I\xe2\x80\x99m not pregnant.\nSheldon: May I have one of your fries?\nAmy: Of course. Can I have a bite of your burger?\nSheldon: Absolutely not.\nLeonard: Some perfect couple. He won\xe2\x80\x99t even share his food with her.\nSheldon: It has avocado on it. She\xe2\x80\x99s allergic to avocado. Are you so jealous of our relationship you want Amy to die?\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m not jealous. I just think it\xe2\x80\x99s silly for you to compare relationships like they\xe2\x80\x99re something that can be quantified.\nSheldon: Everything is quantifiable. That French fry? A seven. Spider-Man? A nine. The number nine? Oddly, only a four.\nLeonard: How ridiculous is he?\nPenny: A hundred.\nLeonard: Sheldon, you\xe2\x80\x99re just assigning random numbers to things based on your opinion.\nSheldon: No, I\xe2\x80\x99m not. French fries have three variables, crispiness, saltiness and shape. Which is why a curly fry only gets a two. If I wanted curls for dinner, I\xe2\x80\x99d order a clown wig.\nPenny: Well, a relationship is more complicated than a French fry.\nSheldon: Not according to the work of Berscheid, Snyder and Omoto.\nPenny: Oh, what did those rascals do now?\nAmy: They developed the Relationship Closeness Inventory, which predicts the stability of a couple based on behaviour.\nSheldon: Yeah, not to be confused with the French Fry Goodness Inventory. That\xe2\x80\x99s pure Cooper.\nLeonard: So, this is accurate?\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s been around for 25 years, and has been extensively corroborated by other researchers.\nPenny: Well, kind of takes the romance out of relationships.\nSheldon: Kind of? It does it perfectly.\nAmy: Sheldon and I got an eight-point-two out of ten.\nLeonard: Fine. We\xe2\x80\x99ll take it right now.\nPenny: No, don\xe2\x80\x99t.\nLeonard: What?\nPenny: Just don\xe2\x80\x99t take it.\nLeonard: Why not?\nPenny: \xe2\x80\x98Cause it\xe2\x80\x99s stupid. Who cares what number it is?\nLeonard: Come on. It\xe2\x80\x99ll be fun.\nPenny: I said I don\xe2\x80\x99t want you to. I\xe2\x80\x99m getting another drink.\nLeonard: Sorry.\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna let you count this as two dates. They\xe2\x80\x99re a lot of work.\nScene: The gym.\nBernadette: Think he\xe2\x80\x99s getting any better?\nRaj: Yup.\nHoward: That was a close one.\nBernadette: Okay.\nRaj: Is it too late for him to cancel?\nBernadette: I think so.\nHoward: Heads up! Watch out!\nScene: The pub.\nLeonard: Are you mad at me?\nPenny: No, stop being stupid.\nLeonard: Um, whew? Is this about the test, or is this about us?\nPenny: Look, I don\xe2\x80\x99t need a score on a test to make me worry about something I\xe2\x80\x99m already worried about.\nLeonard: What are you worried about?\nPenny: That we\xe2\x80\x99re engaged and have nothing in common, and it scares me.\nLeonard: Yeah, that scares me, too.\nPenny: It does?\nLeonard: Sometimes.\nPenny: Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s not good. You being blindly infatuated with me was the rock we were building this relationship on.\nLeonard: Okay, well, this might make you feel better. Uh, we\xe2\x80\x99re both scared that our marriage will be a disaster, and so, that\xe2\x80\x99s something that we have in common. Also, we both think I\xe2\x80\x99m not funny. Huh? See, you\xe2\x80\x99re not laughing.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nMike (on Skype): Hey, Froot Loops, what\xe2\x80\x99s up?\nHoward: Hey, Mike. Listen, NASA asked me to throw out the first pitch at an Angels game. You got any advice?\nMike: Yeah. Don\xe2\x80\x99t do it. What else you up to?\nHoward: Why shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t I do it?\nMike: There\xe2\x80\x99s no upside. If you do well, no one cares. And if you screw up, you\xe2\x80\x99re an idiot on YouTube forever.\nHoward: But it\xe2\x80\x99s for a good cause. What about all the kids that\xe2\x80\x99ll be there?\nMike: That\xe2\x80\x99s what I\xe2\x80\x99m telling you. Kids are the worst. My own daughter tweeted I have a giant nose.\nHoward: Well, maybe I\xe2\x80\x99ll do a good job.\nMike: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. In space, you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t even toss me a pen, and that was in zero gravity.\nHoward: Okay, thanks for the pep talk.\nMike: Anytime, Froot Loops. Give your wife a hug for me. She\xe2\x80\x99s so much cuter than you, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how you ever got her.\nBernadette: He\xe2\x80\x99s so nice.\nScene: The pub.\nPenny: Hey, sorry about that.\nAmy: No, we\xe2\x80\x99re sorry. We never should have been comparing relationships in the first place.\nSheldon: Why? We won. You know, I say, next, we take on Koothrappali and his dog. Really give ourselves a challenge.\nLeonard: I just want to say one more thing about this. Just because Penny and I are very different people does not mean that we\xe2\x80\x99re a bad couple.\nSheldon: The answer is one simple test away. Hmm? You know, it\xe2\x80\x99s like when I thought there was a possum in my closet. Did I sit around wondering? No, I sent Leonard in with a pointy stick and a bag.\nLeonard: I killed his Chewbacca slippers.\nPenny: Let\xe2\x80\x99s just take the test.\nLeonard: No, no, no, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to.\nPenny: Oh, well, \xe2\x80\x99cause you know we\xe2\x80\x99re gonna do bad.\nLeonard: Because it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter. I don\xe2\x80\x99t care if we\xe2\x80\x99re a ten or a two.\nSheldon: Or a one. A one is possible.\nLeonard: Marriage is scary. You\xe2\x80\x99re scared, I\xe2\x80\x99m scared. But it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make me not want to do it. It, it just makes me want to hold your hand and do it with you.\nPenny: Leonard.\nAmy: It would make me so happy if you said things like that.\nSheldon: We got an eight-point-two. Trust me, you\xe2\x80\x99re happy.\nScene: Angels Stadium\nRaj: Mmm, I love how they put a waterfall at centre field. It really ties the whole stadium together.\nPenny: Look at you, talking sports.\nLeonard: This is fun, huh? We get to see our friend throw out the first pitch, have a hot dog, watch the game.\nSheldon: Whoa. Nobody said anything about watching the game.\nAmy: Sheldon, what did you expect?\nSheldon: I expected to see Howard throw the baseball, finish my hot dog, and hightail it across the street to Disneyland just in time for Mickey\xe2\x80\x99s Soundsational Parade.\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what. If we stay, I\xe2\x80\x99ll buy you cotton candy and a bobblehead.\nSheldon: Who\xe2\x80\x99s the bobblehead of?\nAmy: Does it matter?\nSheldon: No, as long as it bobbles.\nBernadette: Howie, I am so proud of you.\nHoward: Thanks. I\xe2\x80\x99m proud of me, too.\nMan: You ready?\nHoward: Let\xe2\x80\x99s do it.\nMan: All right.\nHoward: Wish me luck.\nBernadette: Go get \xe2\x80\x99em.\nStadium Announcer: Ladies and gentlemen, in honour of Space Day at Angel Stadium, the first pitch will be thrown out by NASA astronaut Howard Wolowitz.\nHoward: Thank you. Thank you.\nPenny: Can he really throw a ball?\nLeonard: On our Quidditch team, he\xe2\x80\xa6\nPenny: Yeah, that\xe2\x80\x99s a no.\nHoward: I have a message for the young people here today. When I was asked to throw the first pitch, a little voice in my head said I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do it. So, I practiced and practiced, and you know what? That little voice was right, but then I remembered that I\xe2\x80\x99m not an athlete. I\xe2\x80\x99m a scientist. So, today\xe2\x80\x99s first pitch will be delivered to home plate by science. Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, I present to you a working prototype of the Mars Rover. And here\xe2\x80\x99s the wind-up, and the pitch.\nBernadette: Why is it going so slow?\nHoward: \xe2\x80\x98Cause I\xe2\x80\x99m an idiot who didn\xe2\x80\x99t think this through.\nSheldon: Okay, new plan. We go to Disneyland, play hide and seek on Tom Sawyer\xe2\x80\x99s Island, and then come back and see the end of the pitch.\nHoward: Okay, while we\xe2\x80\x99re waiting for the ball to arrive, here\xe2\x80\x99s some fun facts about Mars.\nMan in Crowd: You suck, Wolowitz!\nSheldon: He makes a valid point.\nHoward: Okay, booing isn\xe2\x80\x99t gonna make it go any faster.\nAdvertisements'
