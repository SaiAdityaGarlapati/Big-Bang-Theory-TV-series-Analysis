b'Following a \xe2\x80\x9cpreviously on\xe2\x80\x9d sequence.\nScene: Outside the University legal office.\nHoward: Okay, I gotta ask, why are you wearing a bow tie?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99ve never applied for a patent before. I wanted to make a good impression.\nHoward: Is the impression that your first name is Pee-Wee?\nSheldon: Yeah, well, you\xe2\x80\x99re an engineer. End of joke, burn.\nAttorney: Come on in, fellas.\nHoward: See, he\xe2\x80\x99s not wearing a tie.\nLeonard: Well, he\xe2\x80\x99s a patent attorney. Maybe his tie is pending.\nAttorney: So, I\xe2\x80\x99ve reviewed your paperwork, and it seems like we\xe2\x80\x99ve got everything we need to file a patent for your infinite persistence gyroscope.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s great.\nHoward: Excellent.\nLeonard: So what happens next?\nAttorney: Well, the legal team needs to review existing patents to avoid overlap.\nHoward: Oh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there will be.\nLeonard: Yeah, we did our own search.\nAttorney: That\xe2\x80\x99s nice, but I think ours might be a bit more thorough.\nSheldon: Get a load of this guy.\nHoward: Can you imagine if we make money with this?\nLeonard: If we do, I am splurging on the best sinus irrigator money can buy.\nHoward: That old sad story, guy gets a little money, goes straight up his nose.\nAttorney: Just need you to review and sign this document acknowledging that you understand the university will own 75% of the patent.\nHoward: Seventy-five percent?\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s outrageous. This is our idea based on our research. How can you possibly justify owning a majority share?\nAttorney: It\xe2\x80\x99s university policy.\nSheldon: I know when I\xe2\x80\x99m beat.\nLeonard: Hold on, hold on. So the three of us do all the work and only end up with 25%?\nAttorney: Dr. Hofstadter, this university has been paying your salaries for over ten years. Did you think we do that out of the goodness of our hearts?\nLeonard: Well, until you just said that mean thing, kinda.\nAttorney: And as far as Mr. Wolowitz is concerned, I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid as a federal employee on loan from NASA, your name can be on the patent, but you\xe2\x80\x99re not entitled to an ownership share.\nHoward: Wait, so this can turn out to be a financial success, and I get nothing?\nAttorney: Well, sometimes they give you a plaque.\nSheldon: Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s not fair. We should all get plaques.\nLeonard: Sorry, but we can\xe2\x80\x99t sign this.\nHoward: Come on, let\xe2\x80\x99s go.\nLeonard: Thank you for your time.\nSheldon: Couple of questions about the plaque.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nAmy: So, have you been having any morning sickness?\nBernadette: A little. And it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t help that I\xe2\x80\x99ve got this heightened sense of smell.\nPenny: Is that a pregnancy thing?\nBernadette: Yeah. The other day I sniffed out where Howie hid the Girl Scout cookies. No more Tagalongs, my ass.\nPenny: But now you\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to make your own milk to eat the cookies with.\nRaj: Hey, guys. Hey, Penny. I really appreciate you helping me with this. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to do.\nPenny: Oh, sure. Let me see it.\nAmy: See what?\nRaj: I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t spoken to Emily since I broke up with her, and she left this on my doorstep with a note.\nPenny: Raj, I got you this before we split up, but couldn\xe2\x80\x99t return it and thought you\xe2\x80\x99d like to have it. Happy belated Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s Day, Emily.\nBernadette: That\xe2\x80\x99s nice.\nPenny: Nice, or is she trying to manipulate him?\nRaj: I know. I mean, do I open it? Do I return it?\nAmy: Why wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you open it?\nRaj: Well, she was pretty mad. For all I know it\xe2\x80\x99s a voodoo doll of me with a fork stuck in my junk.\nBernadette: You don\xe2\x80\x99t think she\xe2\x80\x99d actually send you something gross or dangerous, do you?\nPenny: I know one way to find out. Sniff this.\nAmy: She\xe2\x80\x99s pregnant, she\xe2\x80\x99s not a bloodhound.\nBernadette: Although I am getting a little machine oil. I think it\xe2\x80\x99s metal.\nPenny: Come on, just open it.\nRaj: You know, on Game of Thrones, Balon Greyjoy received his son\xe2\x80\x99s genitals in a box.\nPenny: Well, never hurts to have a spare.\nBernadette: What is that?\nRaj: Wow. It\xe2\x80\x99s an antique sextant. Sailors used these to find their position by the stars.\nAmy: What a nice gift for an astrophysicist.\nRaj: I know, she\xe2\x80\x99s so thoughtful.\nPenny: See, she\xe2\x80\x99s trying to get you back. Now, that is exactly what I would\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten you if I had any idea what it is or what you do.\nRaj: You know, I have too much self-esteem to let this girl guilt me into getting back together with her.\nAmy: You don\xe2\x80\x99t need to be pregnant to smell that load of crap.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: Well, what if we go around the university and just get the patent ourselves?\nHoward: We can\xe2\x80\x99t. It says on their Web site, as long as we work there, they have a controlling ownership of anything we come up with.\nSheldon: Great, so they own my idea for a T-shirt that says Dumb as a Bag of Geologists.\nLeonard: Well, our choices are we do this with the university or we don\xe2\x80\x99t do it at all.\nHoward: Either way, I get nothing.\nLeonard: Or, if we ended up making money from this, Sheldon and I could split our shares with you.\nSheldon: To be clear, Leonard is referring to the gyroscope, not the T-shirt and mugs. Oh, now they own the mugs.\nHoward: I guess that is a way around this. You guys would be cool doing it like that?\nLeonard: Of course, we can split any profits three ways.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m fine with that.\nHoward: Okay, great.\nSheldon: It sounds like a, uh, contract might be in order.\nLeonard: Sure, we could write something up.\nSheldon: But which one of us should be the party who\xe2\x80\xa6\nHoward: You can do it, Sheldon.\nSheldon: So stipulated.\nLeonard: Once I found a stash of contracts under his bed. It was weird.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nBernadette: I wonder how much she spent on this.\nAmy: Ooh, let\xe2\x80\x99s find out.\nRaj: It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter. It\xe2\x80\x99s the thought that counts.\nPenny: Yeah, yeah, and beauty\xe2\x80\x99s on the inside, size doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter, how much she spend?\nRaj: Seriously, guys, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to know.\nAmy: Oh, my.\nRaj: Oh, come on, you can\xe2\x80\x99t say oh my, and then not tell me.\nAmy: These things go for five hundred dollars and up.\nBernadette: Damn. All I got for Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s Day was a postcard saying my Vermont Teddy Bear was back-ordered.\nPenny: Okay, so, she drops off a five hundred dollar gift and she\xe2\x80\x99s not trying to get back together with you?\nRaj: Maybe you\xe2\x80\x99re right.\nBernadette: Or she\xe2\x80\x99s telling the truth and just being nice.\nRaj: Maybe you\xe2\x80\x99re right. Wow, I am easy to manipulate. (Phone rings) Oh, guys, it\xe2\x80\x99s Emily. What should I do?\nPenny: Okay, answer it. Just be strong. And if she starts to cry, don\xe2\x80\x99t make any promises. And most importantly, put it on speaker so we can hear.\nRaj: Hello?\nEmily (voice): Hey, it\xe2\x80\x99s Emily. Is this a good time?\nRaj: Yeah, yeah. Sure. What\xe2\x80\x99s up?\nEmily: Was it okay I left that gift? I\xe2\x80\x99m really hoping we can be friends.\nRaj: Maybe, maybe.\nEmily: Um, you think you\xe2\x80\x99d want to grab a cup of coffee? Hello?\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, I seem to be taking an annoying amount of time deciding how I feel about this.\nEmily: I just, I miss hanging out with you. It\xe2\x80\x99s not like I lost a friend, it\xe2\x80\x99s like I lost my best friend. Is there any chance you\xe2\x80\x99d want to come over?\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x99s a good idea.\nEmily: Okay. I\xe2\x80\x99m just, I\xe2\x80\x99m having a really hard time, but that\xe2\x80\x99s not your problem, that\xe2\x80\x99s mine. I, I won\xe2\x80\x99t bother you again, but please know that you\xe2\x80\x99ll always have a place in my heart. Bye, Raj. You\xe2\x80\x99re a good guy.\nRaj: Good-bye, Emily. That was rough, you guys.\nPenny: I know, but you did it. I\xe2\x80\x99m so proud of you.\nRaj: Well, anyway, I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave you to your girls\xe2\x80\x99 night.\nAmy: Are you sure you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to stay here with us?\nRaj: No, I kind of feel like being alone right now.\nBernadette: Well, if you change your mind, we\xe2\x80\x99ll be here.\nRaj: Thank you.\nPenny: Say hi to Emily for us.\nRaj: Will do.\nScene: The apartment.\nHoward: This contract looks good to me.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99ll say it looks good. It\xe2\x80\x99s in my proprietary font, Shelvetica.\nLeonard: I want to say something obnoxious, but it is easy on the eyes.\nBernadette: I\xe2\x80\x99m a little tired, Howie. You ready to go?\nHoward: Yeah, one sec. I just need to sign this contract.\nBernadette: What is it?\nHoward: Well, we ran into a problem about my share of the patent, so we\xe2\x80\x99re forming a partnership to split anything we make equally.\nPenny: Sheldon, did you draft the contract?\nSheldon: You bet I did.\nPenny: Ooh. You\xe2\x80\x99re gonna make out so hard tonight.\nBernadette: So, you\xe2\x80\x99re just gonna sign this without having a lawyer look at it?\nSheldon: Excuse me. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been drafting contracts since kindergarten. Didn\xe2\x80\x99t need a lawyer to get me out of finger painting. Don\xe2\x80\x99t need one now.\nBernadette: I know, but\xe2\x80\xa6\nHoward: Bernie, the guys were nice enough to find a way to keep me from being cut out.\nBernadette: Well, I should hope so. The whole thing was your idea.\nAmy: Well, to be fair, Howard\xe2\x80\x99s idea was based on Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s math.\nLeonard: Guys, everyone is involved in thios, okay? Howard\xe2\x80\x99s invention, Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s math, my original theory that space-time was like a supercooled liquid. Which I\xe2\x80\x99m sure Penny would\xe2\x80\x99ve mentioned if she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t working on that hangnail right now.\nPenny: What?\nHoward: Honey, this is fine.\nBernadette: If you want to sign a contract that Sheldon whipped up, go ahead.\nHoward: Can I talk to you in the hall?\nBernadette: Sure.\nHoward: Excuse us.\nSheldon: Hey, Leonard.\nLeonard: What?\nSheldon: If she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t think that we should apply for this patent, she\xe2\x80\x99s being patently absurd.\nLeonard: Good one.\nSheldon: Okay, you got it. See, I was afraid it was a thinker.\nHoward: What are you doing?\nBernadette: I just want to make sure you\xe2\x80\x99ve thought this through.\nHoward: What\xe2\x80\x99s to think about? We have an invention and want to move forward.\nBernadette: Howie, you\xe2\x80\x99re about to form a legal partnership with Sheldon Cooper.\nHoward: All right, if you\xe2\x80\x99re gonna calmly make excellent points, then I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if I want to talk to you. Okay. I get it. And it\xe2\x80\x99s sweet that you\xe2\x80\x99re worried about me, but I can take care of myself.\nBernadette: I\xe2\x80\x99m not worried about you. I\xe2\x80\x99m worried about me. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to go through this pregnancy listening to you complain about Sheldon driving you crazy more than you already do.\nHoward: Here we go with the ironclad logic again.\nBernadette: You\xe2\x80\x99ve tried to work with him before. It hasn\xe2\x80\x99t gone well. Why is this time gonna be any different?\nHoward: Is the foetus helping you? \xe2\x80\x98Cause that\xe2\x80\x99s cheating.\nScene: Raj\xe2\x80\x99s car.\nRaj (answering phone): Hello?\nClaire: Hey, Raj. It\xe2\x80\x99s Claire. How are you?\nRaj: Hi. I\xe2\x80\x99m good. Really good. Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why I said really good. I\xe2\x80\x99m just regular good. I really just wanted to sound confident. And that really was a real really, not a fake really like the first really.\nClaire: Really?\nRaj: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I lost track and I missed my exit. So, uh, so what\xe2\x80\x99s up?\nClaire: Well, last time we talked, I had just gotten back together with my boyfriend, and I wanted to let you know that things didn\xe2\x80\x99t work out.\nRaj: Really? I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. I swear I know other words.\nClaire: So if you were still interested.\nRaj: Yes. Indeed. Absolutely. Indubitably. I\xe2\x80\x99m not even sure what the last one means, but it\xe2\x80\x99s another word, and I know it. So, uh, when do you want to meet up?\nClaire: Uh, I\xe2\x80\x99m almost off work. What are you doing now?\nRaj: Right now, well, well, actually, to, to be completely honest, I\xe2\x80\x99m stopping by to see my ex-girlfriend because she\xe2\x80\x99s having a tough time. But it\xe2\x80\x99s not like we\xe2\x80\x99re getting back together or anything.\nClaire: Let me guess, the worst part about breaking up is that she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have her best friend to talk to any more?\nRaj: That\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what she said. How do you know that?\nClaire: I\xe2\x80\x99m a girl. It\xe2\x80\x99s, like, page one out of the playbook.\nRaj: Any chance you could send me a PDF of that playbook?\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: They\xe2\x80\x99ve been out there a while.\nAmy: I hope everything\xe2\x80\x99s okay.\nSheldon: I wonder what they\xe2\x80\x99re talking about.\nPenny: If you guys would shut up, I could tell you. Oh. Be cool, be cool, be cool.\nHoward: Hey.\nSheldon: Hello.\nLeonard: You guys all right?\nHoward: Yeah. But, um, we were talking, and I\xe2\x80\x99m a little concerned about the three of us forming a partnership.\nSheldon: Are you suggesting a limited liability corporation? \xe2\x80\x98Cause I did not L-L-see that coming.\nHoward: Sheldon, my concern is not with the money or anything. It\xe2\x80\x99s, it\xe2\x80\x99s with how you treat me.\nSheldon: Well, I believe I\xe2\x80\x99m treating you generously. That\xe2\x80\x99s why I\xe2\x80\x99ve stipulated in the contract that your contributions to our invention are as valuable as my own.\nBernadette: Are you saying that his contributions aren\xe2\x80\x99t as valuable as yours?\nSheldon: No, I am not saying that, because I kept saying that this morning and Leonard said stop saying that.\nHoward: See? This is what happens every time we work together.\nPenny: You know what, hang on. What if Sheldon had no choice but to be respectful?\nLeonard: What? Is there a switch on the back of his neck we don\xe2\x80\x99t know about?\nPenny: No. What I\xe2\x80\x99m saying is you could add a clause to the contract that he can\xe2\x80\x99t make fun of Howard.\nBernadette: How would you enforce it?\nSheldon: Oh, please. Any contract I sign is enforced by my own personal code of ethics.\nAmy: And his obsessive-compulsive disorder.\nSheldon: Yeah, that, too. And scoot over. Part of your shadow\xe2\x80\x99s on my spot.\nLeonard: Howard, what do you think?\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m on board.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99ll add it right now. Oh, baby, it\xe2\x80\x99s addendum time.\nScene: Raj\xe2\x80\x99s car.\nEmily (voice): Hello?\nRaj: Hey, Emily, listen, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been thinking, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure it\xe2\x80\x99s a good idea that I come over.\nEmily: Oh. Okay. I understand.\nRaj: No, no. Please don\xe2\x80\x99t cry.\nEmily: Okay, I\xe2\x80\x99ll stop.\nfade\nClaire: Hello?\nRaj: Hey, so, listen, Claire, change of plans\xe2\x80\xa6\nClaire: Fine. Do what you want, but she\xe2\x80\x99s playing you.\nRaj: I don\xe2\x80\x99t think so. She sounded pretty upset.\nClaire: You mean like, I was just really looking forward to seeing you. I\xe2\x80\x99m having such a rough day.\nfade\nRaj: Emily, listen, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, but I can\xe2\x80\x99t come by.\nEmily: Why not?\nRaj: I think we both know if I come over, we\xe2\x80\x99re gonna get back together and\xe2\x80\xa6\nEmily: I told you I needed a friend. What do you think is happening here?\nRaj: Call you right back.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: The, the revisions I made start on page four.\nPenny: Wow. That is a lot of whereupons.\nAmy: You should see the Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s Day card he gave me.\nHoward: Article three, as it pertains to this project, Dr. Sheldon Cooper promises to abstain from all insulting or disrespectful language directed toward Howard Wolowitz, including but not limited to mockery of engineering, his height, his hair, his wardrobe, and his insane belief that the Ghost Rider movie was, quote, not that bad.\nLeonard: Hang on. Maybe there should be a no insult clause about me, too.\nSheldon: Do you still like cilantro?\nLeonard: Yeah.\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re tying my hands here.\nHoward: All right, let\xe2\x80\x99s sign this.\nPenny: Wait, wait, wait. What are these changes on page six?\nAmy: Sheldon, what did you do?\nHoward: I should\xe2\x80\x99ve known.\nBernadette: 25% of profits due to Sheldon Cooper will be allocated to a scholarship fund for the firstborn child of Howard and Bernadette Wolowitz. Sheldon, that\xe2\x80\x99s so nice.\nLeonard: That beats the onesie I was gonna get them from baby Gap.\nHoward: That\xe2\x80\x99s very generous, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99ve always valued education over money. And the very fact that you needed a written guarantee of respect made me realize how dismissive I\xe2\x80\x99ve been of your contributions.\nHoward: I appreciate that.\nSheldon: And I just hope that this scholarship can rescue your child from the subpar education and menial life of an engineer.\nAmy: Sheldon.\nSheldon: What? I didn\xe2\x80\x99t sign it yet.\nScene: Raj\xe2\x80\x99s car.\nRaj: I hear what you\xe2\x80\x99re saying, but I\xe2\x80\x99ve known Emily a long time, and I think she deserves the benefit of the doubt.\nClaire: All right, it\xe2\x80\x99s your life. But you know how this is gonna end.\nRaj: As a matter of fact, I do. I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna comfort her, because I\xe2\x80\x99m a caring and decent friend who\xe2\x80\x99s happy to be there when she needs someone to talk to.\nScene: Emily\xe2\x80\x99s bed.\nRaj: Good talk.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
