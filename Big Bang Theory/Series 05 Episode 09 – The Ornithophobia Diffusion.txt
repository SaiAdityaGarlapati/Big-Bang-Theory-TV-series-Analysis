b'Scene: The lobby.\nPenny: Hey.\nLeonard: Oh, hey. You work the lunch shift?\nPenny: Yeah. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got eight pounds of salmon that\xe2\x80\x99s about to go bad. Do you know how to cook it?\nLeonard: Not really.\nPenny: Damn it. Should have liberated the iffy chicken. What are you and Professor Fussyface up to tonight?\nLeonard: Star Wars on Blu-ray.\nPenny: Haven\xe2\x80\x99t you seen that movie, like, a thousand times?\nLeonard: Not on Blu-ray. Only twice on Blu-ray.\nPenny: Oh, Leonard.\nLeonard: I know, it\xe2\x80\x99s high-resolution sadness.\nPenny: Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to take myself out to a movie tonight. You want to go?\nLeonard: Really? Do we do that?\nPenny: What do you mean?\nLeonard: You know, we haven\xe2\x80\x99t spent time alone together since we broke up.\nPenny: Oh, it\xe2\x80\x99s not a date, Leonard. It\xe2\x80\x99s just a man and a woman hanging out, and not having sex at the end of the night.\nLeonard: Sounds like most of my dates.\nSheldon (off, voice heard through apartment door as they approach): Oh, dear Lord, get away from me, you monster!\nPenny: What is that about?\nLeonard: Well, he\xe2\x80\x99s smart and crazy enough, he may have actually created a monster. (They enter. Sheldon is by the window.)\nSheldon: Shoo, shoo! Be gone!\nLeonard: What the hell is going on?\nSheldon: There\xe2\x80\x99s a bird outside the window, and he won\xe2\x80\x99t go away. That is the hell that is going on. We have no worms or seeds here. Shoo, shoo.\nPenny: Really? On top of everything else, you\xe2\x80\x99re afraid of birds?\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s called ornithophobia. And someday it will be recognized as a true disability, and the landlord will be required by law to put a giant net over the building. Which is unfortunate, because I have a fear of nets.\nPenny: So movies, yes or no?\nLeonard: Movies, yes.\nPenny: Great. I\xe2\x80\x99ll see you later. And remember, he\xe2\x80\x99s more afraid of you than you are of him.\nSheldon: That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t help.\nPenny: No, I was talking to the bird.\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Go away, bird. (Knock, knock, knock) Go away, bird. (Knock, knock, knock) Go away, bird.\nLeonard: Sheldon, just ignore him.\nSheldon: Good idea. Attention is what birds want. (Pulls curtain) Oh, much better. All right. Now I\xe2\x80\x99ll just get along with my life. (Bird squawks) Make a pot of tea, Leonard. It\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a long night.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The apartment.Sheldon is trying to scare the bird away making cat noises.\nLeonard: The bird\xe2\x80\x99s still there?\nSheldon: Quick, what does a hawk sound like?\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Scree-scree.\nSheldon: Please, that\xe2\x80\x99s a seagull. If you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to help, don\xe2\x80\x99t help.\nLeonard: Sorry. Do you think I\xe2\x80\x99m overdressed?\nSheldon: It depends on the activity. For a prostate exam, yes. If you\xe2\x80\x99re playing Vegas, I\xe2\x80\x99d add sequins.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m going to the movies with Penny. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want her to think that I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a date.\nSheldon: Do you think it\xe2\x80\x99s a date?\nLeonard: No, but she might think I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a date even though I don\xe2\x80\x99t.\nSheldon: Or you might think she thinks you think it\xe2\x80\x99s a date even though she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t.\nLeonard: Are we overthinking this?\nSheldon: Not at all.\nLeonard: You\xe2\x80\x99re right. I\xe2\x80\x99m fine. I\xe2\x80\x99m wearing this.\nSheldon: Really? A blazer? All right. (Leonard takes off blazer and heads back to his room. Sheldon dials phone) Yes, hello. This is Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Yeah, I\xe2\x80\x99m at 2311 North Robles Avenue. Yeah, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to report a dangerous wild animal. A blue jay. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, this is Animal Control. I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand the laughter. No, the bird is not in my home. If he was in my home, I obviously would have called 911. Sir, I have no doubt that there are things that you\xe2\x80\x99re frightened of. Being stuck in a dead-end public service job? Or your wife stepping out on you because you\xe2\x80\x99re stuck in a dead-end public service job? Or spiders? Don\xe2\x80\x99t you think I tried making cat noises?\nLeonard (returning in a tee shirt and backwards cap): Too casual?\nSheldon: For an audience with the queen, yes. For an evening of passing a bottle of fortified wine around a flaming trash can, you look great. (Leonard leaves again. Sheldon draws a picture of a cats face and returns to making cat noises at the window.) What am I thinking? Whiskers!\nScene: The cinema.\nPenny: Oh, hey, if we hurry, we can make the new Jennifer Aniston movie.\nLeonard: Oh, yeah, sure. There\xe2\x80\x99s also an amazing documentary about building a dam on river in South America.\nPenny: Okay, but the Jennifer Aniston movie has Jennifer Aniston, and she\xe2\x80\x99s not building a dam.\nLeonard: Can\xe2\x80\x99t argue with that. I\xe2\x80\x99ll get the tickets.\nPenny: Okay.\nLeonard: Actually, you know what? I think it\xe2\x80\x99s about time I pick a movie we see.\nPenny: You pick plenty of movies.\nLeonard: No. You always picked, and it was always the same. An hour and a half of beach houses in the rain until the woman turns around and realizes love was here all along.\nPenny: But come on, that is a great movie, and it starts in ten minutes.\nLeonard: I hate those movies.\nPenny: No, you don\xe2\x80\x99t.\nLeonard: Yes, I do. The only reason I went is because you wanted to see them, and I wanted to have sex. To this day, I can\xe2\x80\x99t see a Sandra Bullock movie poster without getting both bored and aroused.\nPenny: Okay, so while we were going out, how often would you pretend to like things just to have sex with me?\nLeonard: All the time.\nPenny: You\xe2\x80\x99re kidding.\nLeonard: Does this sound familiar? I\xe2\x80\x99d love to go shoe shopping with you. Hiking? It\xe2\x80\x99s great. It\xe2\x80\x99s two a.m., of course I want to go to Korea Town and sing karaoke with your friends. Who wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t?\nPenny: Okay, we were going out. You were going to get sex anyway.\nLeonard: Really? You would have slept with me after a three-hour documentary on dams?\nPenny: No. No woman would.\nLeonard: See? Now, that\xe2\x80\x99s the great thing. We\xe2\x80\x99re out as friends. This is not a date. Sex is off the table. So, let\xe2\x80\x99s go learn why hydroelectric power might not be the environmental bargain you think it is. Sorry. Spoiler alert.\nPenny: All right, fine.\nLeonard: Thanks. Tickets are eleven bucks. Not a date.\nScene: The apartment.\nRaj: Come on, Sheldon, Star Wars.\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m pushing play.\nSheldon: A minute.\nHoward: If we don\xe2\x80\x99t start soon, George Lucas is going to change it again.\nSheldon: This would go a lot faster if you put your trade school diploma to work and helped me set up this high frequency tone generator.\nHoward: I have a Masters degree from M.I.T.\nSheldon: Yeah, but you\xe2\x80\x99ve got a can-do attitude and that\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x99s important.\nRaj: I really don\xe2\x80\x99t get your problem with birds.\nSheldon: The question you should be asking is what is their problem with me? My first memory, a hummingbird dive-bombing my stroller to get at the apple juice in my sippy cup.\nRaj: Hummingbirds are pretty.\nSheldon: Hummingbirds are the vampires of the flower world.\nRaj: Still my first choice for an ankle tattoo. Or a dolphin, I go back and forth.\nSheldon: Age seven, a blood-thirsty chicken chases me up a tree. Age twelve, a magpie tries to steal the retainer out of my mouth. Age sixteen, a parrot in a pet store called me fat ass. Need I go on?\nRaj: Yes, please. This is way better than the movie.\nHoward: All right, Sheldon, your bird death ray is ready.\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s not a death ray. It\xe2\x80\x99s just a little ultrasonic blast to scare him off. Trust me, if I had a death ray, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be living here. I\xe2\x80\x99d be in my lair enjoying the money the people of Earth gave me for not using my death ray. All right, and in three, two, one. (Switches on. All the windows shatter. The bird doesn\xe2\x80\x99t move.)\nRaj: That is one tough birdie.\nScene: A bar.\nLeonard: Come on, you enjoyed the movie. I saw you tearing up when the village got flooded, and everyone had to relocate.\nPenny: No, I was thinking how come they get to leave and I can\xe2\x80\x99t.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m going to get some fries. You want anything?\nPenny: Uh, no, thanks.\nLeonard: Are you sure? Because you always say no, and then you eat half my fries.\nPenny: I just eat the little crispy ones you don\xe2\x80\x99t like.\nLeonard: No, I love them. I save them for the end, but they\xe2\x80\x99re gone because you ate them. And why did I let you eat them?\nPenny: To get sex.\nLeonard: Exactly. But this is not a date. So I ask again, would you like anything?\nPenny: All right, I\xe2\x80\x99d like an order of fries.\nLeonard: Great. That\xe2\x80\x99ll be five dollars. I am having the best time. I\xe2\x80\x99m so glad you suggested we do this.\nPenny (accidentally nudging the man sitting behind her): Oh, sorry.\nMan: No problem.\nPenny: What you writing there?\nMan: A screenplay. Its about a guy whose roommate is having sex and tells him go to a bar and work on his screenplay.\nPenny: I Hope Alex Gets Crabs: The Movie.\nMan: It\xe2\x80\x99s a working title.\nPenny: Oh.\nMan: I\xe2\x80\x99m Kevin.\nPenny: Oh. Penny. Nice to meet you.\nKevin: I\xe2\x80\x99ll let you get back to your date.\nPenny: Oh, no, no. This isn\xe2\x80\x99t a date, no. Right?\nLeonard: Uh, right.\nPenny: So have you written anything I might have seen?\nKevin: That depends. How much time do you spend on Yelp?\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: This is ridiculous. I\xe2\x80\x99m a grown man from Texas. This isn\xe2\x80\x99t a terrifying bird like a swan or a goose. It\xe2\x80\x99s just a blue jay. (Opens window) That\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty big blue jay. (Closes window. Goes to cabinet. Comes out wearing a Boba Fett helmet and a broom) One, two, three. (Opens window) Go! Shoo! Am-scray, ird-bay! (Bird flies in window) Bird in the apartment! Bird in the apartment! (Sees the bird sitting in his place) No!\nScene: The bar.\nPenny (to Kevin): So it is an amazing documentary. They need the electricity from the dam, but at the same time they want to preserve the environment.\nLeonard: You\xe2\x80\x99re kidding me. Uh, can I see you for a sec over here?\nPenny: Oh, yeah. Sure. Just one sec?\nKevin: No problem.\nPenny: What\xe2\x80\x99s up?\nLeonard: I know what you\xe2\x80\x99re doing.\nPenny: What am I doing?\nLeonard: You\xe2\x80\x99re going out of your way to talk to that guy because I said we weren\xe2\x80\x99t on a date.\nPenny: No, I\xe2\x80\x99m talking to him because he\xe2\x80\x99s cute.\nLeonard: Come on, he\xe2\x80\x99s not that cute.\nPenny: Yes, he is. With his dorky T-shirt and his little hipster glasses.\nLeonard: I wear dorky T-shirts and glasses.\nPenny: Yes, but when you\xe2\x80\x99re tall and have great cheekbones, you\xe2\x80\x99re doing it ironically.\nLeonard: If that\xe2\x80\x99s so, what if I start talking to a girl?\nPenny: You should.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m serious. I\xe2\x80\x99ll do it.\nPenny: Good! Go! There are some girls right over there. What are you waiting for?\nLeonard: They\xe2\x80\x99re in a group. I\xe2\x80\x99m scared.\nScene: The apartment.\nAmy: Sheldon, what do you expect us to do?\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re biologists. Biology is the study of living things. That\xe2\x80\x99s a living thing, get cracking.\nBernadette: I specialize in microorganisms, and Amy studies brains.\nAmy: Yeah, neither of us minored in bird-shooing.\nSheldon: Oh, come now. Your undergraduate work must have included a varmints and critters class.\nBernadette: Come back in, Sheldon, he\xe2\x80\x99s not going to hurt you. He looks friendly. I think he might be someone\xe2\x80\x99s pet.\nSheldon: No, Bernadette, don\xe2\x80\x99t be a hero!\nBernadette: Oh, he\xe2\x80\x99s a sweetie.\nSheldon: Yes. It\xe2\x80\x99s very sweet. Now, slowly and carefully, flush him down the toilet.\nAmy: Sheldon, the only way to get past this fear is to interact with it. Just like you did with the mailman.\nSheldon: Every year tens of people around the world are killed by birds. I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to be another statistic.\nBernadette: Look how sweet he is. Come over and say hi. Come on. You can do it. Don\xe2\x80\x99t be scared. Come on. Oh, just pet the bird, you big baby!\nSheldon: I did it! I actually did it. Okay, now flush him.\nScene: The bar.\nWoman: So, Leonard, what do you do for fun?\nLeonard: Um, let\xe2\x80\x99s see. Hiking. Karaoke in Koreatown. Any Jennifer Aniston movie.\nPenny: Hey. Sorry I ditched you.\nLeonard: No, it\xe2\x80\x99s fine. You can ditch away.\nPenny: Oh, no, no. We said we were going to hang out, let\xe2\x80\x99s hang out.\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s cool. Go back to Kevin.\nPenny: Oh, he had to leave.\nLeonard: Interesting. So now that he\xe2\x80\x99s gone, you want to hang out with me.\nWoman: This must be Penny.\nLeonard: Yep.\nWoman: I totally get it.\nPenny: Huh? I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, get what?\nLeonard: Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry about it. You know, there\xe2\x80\x99s some guys over there. You should go talk to them.\nPenny: No, no. I want to know what you told her.\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99s kind of between me and\xe2\x80\xa6\nWoman: Laura.\nLeonard: Laura.\nPenny: Oh. Okay, I see. So while he was telling you things, did he mention he owns not one, but two Star Trek uniforms?\nLaura: Really?\nPenny: Yeah. Wears them. Not just for Halloween.\nLeonard: Hey, pal. You didn\xe2\x80\x99t see me telling Kevin that you thought cold wars were only fought in winter.\nPenny: Okay. Then I\xe2\x80\x99ll return the favour, and I won\xe2\x80\x99t tell\xe2\x80\xa6\nLaura: Laura.\nPenny: Laura that half the dirty movies you own are animated.\nLeonard: When you were telling Kevin about your acting career, did you mention your long-running role as Waitress in a local production of The Cheesecake Factory?\nPenny: Did you tell her about your lucky asthma inhaler?\nLeonard: Oh, yeah? Spell asthma.\nPenny: A\xe2\x80\xa6 S\xe2\x80\xa6 Take me home.\nLeonard: Maybe I\xe2\x80\x99m not done hanging out with\xe2\x80\xa6 (Laura has gone) You\xe2\x80\x99re right, it\xe2\x80\x99s getting late.\nScene: The apartment. Sheldon has the bird on his arm.\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s remarkable. All that time spent in fear. And for what? He\xe2\x80\x99s magnificent. Oh, dear. I just realized I haven\xe2\x80\x99t offered you a beverage.\nBernadette: Oh, it\xe2\x80\x99s just like my grandma with her parrot. And after she lost her marbles with her remote control.\nSheldon: My phone\xe2\x80\x99s on the desk over there. Take a picture of us together. Make it good enough to go on a mug, a mouse pad, and a calendar. If you were a dove, I\xe2\x80\x99d call you Lovey-Dovey. Oh. Who am I kidding? This isn\xe2\x80\x99t a moment for strict adherence to the literal. You\xe2\x80\x99re just my little Lovey-Dovey, aren\xe2\x80\x99t you?\nAmy: Guess you gotta have hollow bones to get some sugar around here.\nBernadette: I still think he looks like someone\xe2\x80\x99s pet. Maybe we should put up posters.\nSheldon: Yes. It should have a big picture of him, and the words, is this your bird? Not anymore. We\xe2\x80\x99re going to have so much fun together. You can carry messages to all my enemies. I can tie a string to your leg and fly you like a kite.\nAmy: If you\xe2\x80\x99re keeping him, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a cage you can borrow. One of the test monkeys slipped on a banana peel and broke his neck. It was both tragic and hysterical.\nSheldon: Nonsense. No. Lovey-Dovey doesn\xe2\x80\x99t sleep in a cage. No. Lovey-Dovey sleeps in his very own nest, which I\xe2\x80\x99m going to get off the windowsill and put in my room. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that right, LD? (Opens window. Bird flies out.) No. Where are you going? Come back, Lovey-Dovey! This is your home now! I already ordered 20 pounds of bird feed off of Amazon! He\xe2\x80\x99s gone.\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, Sheldon.\nSheldon: How could he do this to me? Get back here, you stupid bird, so I can love you!\nScene: The stairwell. They ascend without talking.\nLeonard: Okay. So, we went out, saw a movie, met some nice people, said horrible things about each other in public, all in all, a pretty magical night.\nPenny: Okay, I\xe2\x80\x99m not innocent in all this, but you basically called me stupid, you asthmatic dumbass.\nLeonard: I know, I, I, I crossed a line. And I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. No, no, no, hang on. I really mean it. And it\xe2\x80\x99s not like when we were going out, I\xe2\x80\x99d just apologize for everything so we could end up in bed. This is a 100% sex-is-off-the-table I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.\nPenny: All right. Thank you. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, too.\nLeonard: Just to be clear, sex is off the table, right?\nPenny: Way off.\nLeonard: Maybe we\xe2\x80\x99re not ready to hang out as friends.\nPenny: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Up until the last part, I was kind of enjoying take-charge Leonard with a little backbone. Picking the movie, knowing what he wants, a little cocky.\nLeonard: Really?\nPenny: Yeah.\nLeonard: Well, then, I\xe2\x80\x99m putting sex back on the table. What do you think about that?\nPenny: Ooh. Maybe I like it.\nLeonard: You do? Because if that\xe2\x80\x99s what you like, I can be that guy. I swear, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be anything you want me to be.\nPenny: Good night, Leonard.\nLeonard: I am such an asthmatic dumbass. I had a weird night.\nSheldon: Mine was great. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to be a mommy. (Reveals nest with an egg in it.)\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
