b'Scene: The downstairs lobby.\nLeonard: See, the liquid metal Terminators were created in the future by Skynet, and Skynet was developed by Miles Dyson, but that future no longer exists, due to Dyson\xe2\x80\x99s death in Terminator 2.\nSheldon: Okay, then riddle me this. Assuming all the good Terminators were originally evil Terminators created by Skynet but then reprogrammed by the future John Connor, why would Skynet, an artificial computer intelligence, bother to create a petite hot 17 year-old killer robot?\nLeonard: Skynet is kinky? I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\nSheldon: Artificial intelligences do not have teen fetishes.\nLeonard: Alright, oh wait, they use it to in\xe2\x80\xa6\nSheldon: (Buzzing noise), too late, I win.\nPenny (voice off, singing, quite tunelessly): Let\xe2\x80\x99s go-oh-oh Ou-oooo-ut tonight. I have to go-oh-oh-oh ou-ooooo-ut tonight.\nLeonard: What the hell is that?\nSheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, but if cats could sing, they\xe2\x80\x99d hate it too. (The continue up the stairs and disappear from view).\nPenny (still singing off): You wanna prowl, be my night owl, (Leonard and Sheldon reappear, running down the stairs) we\xe2\x80\x99ll take my\xe2\x80\xa6 (appearing) Hey guys, hi! Where you going?\nLeonard: What? Oh we just had to\xe2\x80\xa6 mail some letters and (seeing Sheldon has large bag in hand and bin is nearby) throw away some chicken. (Sheldon very reluctantly does.)\nPenny: You\xe2\x80\x99ll never guess what just happened.\nLeonard: Oh, I give up.\nSheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t guess. As a scientist I reach conclusions based on observation and experimentation, although as I\xe2\x80\x99m saying this it occurs to me you may have been employing a rhetorical device rendering my response moot.\nPenny: What was that?\nLeonard: Believe it or not, personal growth. What happened?\nPenny: Alright, remember when I auditioned for that workshop production of Rent, but I didn\xe2\x80\x99t get it and I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t figure out why?\nSheldon: I have a conclusion based on an observation.\nLeonard: No you don\xe2\x80\x99t. No he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t.\nPenny: Well, the girl they picked to play Mimi, she dropped out and they asked me to replace her.\nLeonard: Oh, congratulations, what a lucky break.\nPenny: It\xe2\x80\x99s not a big deal, just a one night showcase, but they invite a lot of casting people and agents so, you never know.\nSheldon: I think I know.\nLeonard: No you don\xe2\x80\x99t. He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t.\nPenny: It\xe2\x80\x99s this Friday at eight, you guys want to come?\nTogether: No.\nLeonard: Because\xe2\x80\xa6. uh, Friday, we are attending a symposium on molecular positronium.\nSheldon: I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a week from Tuesday at six.\nLeonard: No, it\xe2\x80\x99s this Friday, at eight.\nPenny: Oh, too bad, well, I got to get to rehearsal, see you guys.\nLeonard: See you. (Penny exits singing)\nSheldon: You just lied to Penny.\nLeonard: Yes, I did.\nSheldon: And you did it so casually, no rapid breathing, no increase in perspiration.\nLeonard: So?\nSheldon: So, lack of a physiological response while lying is characteristic of a violent sociopath.\nLeonard: Sheldon, are you worried about your safety.\nSheldon: No, I imagine if you were going to kill me you\xe2\x80\x99d have done it a long time ago.\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99s very true.\nLeonard exits. Sheldon looks worried for a moment, then retrieves the chicken from the bin and follows.\nCredits sequence\nScene: Outside Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom.\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock, knock) Leonard, (Knock, knock, knock, knock) Leonard, (Knock, knock, knock, knock) Leonard\xe2\x80\xa6\nLeonard: What?\nSheldon: I need to speak to you.\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s two o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s important.\nLeonard: I highly doubt that. Go away. (Long pause). Are you still out there?\nSheldon: Yes.\nLeonard (opening door): What?\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re right, it can wait until morning.\nLeonard (following Sheldon into living room): What, what, what, what, what?\nSheldon: Never mind. I clearly woke you up in the middle of a REM cycle, you\xe2\x80\x99re in no state to talk.\nLeonard: Sheldon, what is it?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m uncomfortable having been included in your lie to Penny.\nLeonard: What was I supposed to say.\nSheldon: You could have told her the truth.\nLeonard: That would have hurt her feelings.\nSheldon: Is that a relevant factor?\nLeonard: Yes.\nSheldon: Then I suppose you could have agreed to go.\nLeonard: And what would I have said afterwards?\nSheldon: I would suggest something to the effect of, singing is neither an appropriate vocation nor avocation for you, and if you disagree, I\xe2\x80\x99d recommend you have a CAT scan, to look for a tumour pressing on the cognitive processing centre of your brain.\nLeonard: I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t say that, I would have to say, you were terrific and I can\xe2\x80\x99t wait to hear you sing again.\nSheldon: Why?\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s the social protocol, it\xe2\x80\x99s what you do when you have a friend who\xe2\x80\x99s proud of something they really suck at.\nSheldon: I was not aware of that.\nLeonard: Well now you are.\nSheldon: Oh, alright. Leonard.\nLeonard: Yes.\nSheldon: When we played chess earlier, you were terrific and I can\xe2\x80\x99t wait to play you again. Goodnight.\nScene: Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom.\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock, knock) Leonard, (Knock, knock, knock, knock) Leonard, (Knock, knock, knock, knock) Leonard, (Knock, knock, knock, knock) Leonard, (Knock, knock, knock, knock)\xe2\x80\xa6..\nLeonard: Oooaw. This would be so much easier if I were a violent sociopath. (Opening door) What?\nSheldon: I was analysing our lie, and I believe we\xe2\x80\x99re in danger of Penny seeing through the ruse.\nLeonard: How?\nSheldon: Simple. If she were to log on to www.socalphysicsgroup.org/activities/other, click on upcoming events, scroll down to seminars, download the pdf schedule, and look for the seminar on molecular positronium, well then, bippidy-boppidy-boo, our pants are metaphorically on fire.\nLeonard closes door.\nSheldon: Well, sir, my trousers will not be igniting today.\nScene: Outside Penny\xe2\x80\x99s door.\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock, knock) Penny, (Knock, knock, knock, knock) Penny, (Knock, knock, knock, knock) Penny, (door opens) Good morning.\nPenny: Do you have any idea what time it is?\nSheldon: Of course I do. My watch is linked to the atomic clock in Boulder, Colorado. It\xe2\x80\x99s accurate to one tenth of a second. But as I\xe2\x80\x99m saying this it occurs to me that once again your question may have been rhetorical.\nPenny: What do you want?\nSheldon: Remember how Leonard told you we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t come to your performance because we were attending a symposium on molecular positronium?\nPenny: I remember symposium.\nSheldon: Yes, well, he lied.\nPenny: Wait, what?\nSheldon: He lied, and I\xe2\x80\x99m feeling very uncomfortable about it.\nPenny: Well imagine how I\xe2\x80\x99m feeling.\nSheldon: Hungry? Tired? I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry this really isn\xe2\x80\x99t my strong suit.\nScene: The living room.\nLeonard: You told her I lied, why would you tell her I lied?\nSheldon: To help you.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, I\xe2\x80\x99m not seeing the help.\nSheldon: She was going to see through your lie eventually, so I told her that you were lying to protect me.\nLeonard: Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m getting a bad feeling.\nSheldon: Hunger? Indigestion, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry I\xe2\x80\x99m really not very good at this. Anyway, Penny now believes that on Friday night, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to participate in my cousin Leopold\xe2\x80\x99s drug intervention.\nLeonard: Your cousin Leopold?\nSheldon: Yea, who most people call Leo, but he also answers to Lee, remember that, it\xe2\x80\x99s important.\nLeonard: What\xe2\x80\x99s important?\nSheldon: Details, Leonard, the success or failure of our deceitful enterprise turns on details.\nLeonard: Do you have a cousin Leopold.\nSheldon: No, I made him up. I think you\xe2\x80\x99d call him Lee.\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t get it, I already told her a lie, why replace it with a different lie?\nSheldon: Well, first of all, your lie was laughably transparent, where mine is exquisitely convoluted. While you were sleeping I was weaving an un-unravelable web.\nLeonard: Un-unravelable?\nSheldon: Yes, if she googles Leopold Houston she\xe2\x80\x99ll find a facebook page, an online blog depicting his descent into drug use, and a desperate yet hopeful listing on e-harmony.com.\nLeonard: Okay, why would I go to a drug intervention for your cousing.\nSheldon: Ah, because it\xe2\x80\x99s in Long Beach, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t drive.\nLeonard: We\xe2\x80\x99re going to Long Beach?\nSheldon: No, of course not, there\xe2\x80\x99s no cousin Leo, there\xe2\x80\x99s no intervention, focus Leonard.\nLeonard: Oh, come on!\nSheldon: We just leave the house on Friday night, and we return in the wee hours emotionally wrung out from the work of convincing Leo to go back into rehab.\nLeonard: So he goes back into rehab?\nSheldon: Yes, but, he can relapse if Penny ever invites us to go hear her sing again.\nLeonard: You still told her I lied.\nSheldon: For a noble purpose, to spare me the social embarrassment of having a drug-addled first cousin, which I\xe2\x80\x99m assuming is embarrassing, yes?\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. How am I supposed to remember all of this.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s the best part, you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to, see I told Penny that you would be embarrassed, if you knew that she found out that you had lied, so she\xe2\x80\x99s agreed to operate as if the original lie was still in force.\nLeonard: So she\xe2\x80\x99s expecting me to lie about going to a symposium in Pasadena, when in actuality we\xe2\x80\x99re pretending to go to a drug intervention in Long Beach?\nSheldon: Un-unravelable.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard (opening door): Oh hey Penny, wow, look at you, all ready for your showcase, you look great.\nPenny: Thanks. I just wanted to come by and wish you guys luck with your symposium.\nLeonard: Oh, well, thankyou.\nPenny: You know, I got to tell you, a lot of friends would let their friend go alone, but that\xe2\x80\x99s not who you are, you are the kind of guy who stands by a friend when\xe2\x80\xa6 when he has a symposium to go to.\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to say.\nPenny: It\xe2\x80\x99s okay, Leonard (hugs him.)\nLeonard: Oh, okay, alright, good.\nHoward (arriving): Oh boy, group hug.\nPenny: Uh-huh!\nHoward: Uh-huh?\nPenny: Uh-huh!\nHoward: Okay. So what\xe2\x80\x99s up?\nSheldon: Well, uh, Penny is on her way to perform in a one night showcase production of Rent, which we are unable to attend because we are going to a symposium on molecular positronium, given by Dr Emile Farminfarmian.\nHoward: Wait a minute, Farminfarmian is speaking and you\xe2\x80\x99re Bogarding the symposium.\nLeonard: Howard, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry\xe2\x80\xa6 we\xe2\x80\x99re\xe2\x80\xa6 we\xe2\x80\x99re\nHoward: No, no, you\xe2\x80\x99re quark-blocking us.\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to say.\nHoward: Wow.\nLeonard: Howard, listen\xe2\x80\xa6\nHoward: No, it\xe2\x80\x99s okay, it\xe2\x80\x99s your Millenium Falcon, you and Chewbacca do whatever you want to do. Me and Princess Leia here will find some other way to spend the evening.\nPenny: Howard, wait. Sheldon, I think we should tell them.\nSheldon: Okay, sure. I don\xe2\x80\x99t see a problem with that.\nPenny: There\xe2\x80\x99s no symposium, Leonard lied to me, isn\xe2\x80\x99t that right Leonard.\nLeonard: Well\xe2\x80\xa6 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to say.\nPenny: It\xe2\x80\x99s okay, I do, look, Leonard is helping Sheldon through a family crisis, he made up the whole story about the symposium with Dr Farmin..farm\xe2\x80\xa6ian\nSheldon: Good for you.\nPenny: Hah, yeah! Because he didn\xe2\x80\x99t want Sheldon to be embarrassed, and there is nothing to be embarrassed okay, every family in America has a relative holed up in a garage somewhere huffing paint thinner.\nHoward (after Raj whispers in his ear): No, I\xe2\x80\x99m lost too, I think she skipped a step.\nPenny: No, look, Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s cousin Leo escaped rehab, and he\xe2\x80\x99s in a Motel 8 at Long Beach, the whole family\xe2\x80\x99s going out for an intervention. Leonard is driving Sheldon down there to help him through this because he\xe2\x80\x99s such a good man.\nLeonard: Oh, another hug, thank you.\nPenny: Alright you guys, good luck.\nLeonard: Thanks Penny.\nHoward: Yeah, uh, break a leg.\nSheldon: Break a leg. (She leaves)\nHoward: So, road trip to Long Beach.\nLeonard: No, we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to Long Beach.\nRaj: Why not?\nLeonard: Because Sheldon doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have a drug addicted cousin Leopold.\nRaj: Oh, too bad. I\xe2\x80\x99ve always wanted to go to Long Beach.\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s a very nice community. The Queen Mary is docked there, once the largest ocean liner in the world, it\xe2\x80\x99s now a hotel and restaurant where they host a surprisingly gripping murder mystery dinner.\nRaj: Sounds fun.\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m game.\nRaj: Shotgun.\nSheldon: No, no, no, Leonard gets nauseous unless he sits in front, and even then it\xe2\x80\x99s iffy.\nLeonard: Wait, are we really going to Long Beach?\nScene: Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom. The bedside table is piled with Queen Mary memorabilia.\n Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock, knock) Leonard, (Knock, knock, knock, knock) Leonard, (Knock, knock, knock, knock) Leonard\xe2\x80\xa6\nLeonard: Let it go, Sheldon, the murderer was the first mate whether it makes sense to you or not.\nSheldon: No, that\xe2\x80\x99s the least of our worries. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been doing some research on addiction, both the biochemical and behavioural aspects, and I think there\xe2\x80\x99s a problem with the current version of our lie.\nLeonard: What are you talking about, it\xe2\x80\x99s fine, she bought it, it\xe2\x80\x99s over.\nSheldon: Sadly, it\xe2\x80\x99s not. Substance abuse is a lifelong struggle, but beyond that I have realised that the Leo I described would not have agreed to go to rehab.\nLeonard: Why not?\nSheldon: Because Leo is a middle child.\nLeonard: There is no Leo, how can you say that?\nSheldon: You didn\xe2\x80\x99t read the bio, did you? He\xe2\x80\x99s not just a middle child, he\xe2\x80\x99s the quintessential middle child, from a broken home to boot. Psychologically speaking, the attention he gets by rebelling even to the point of self-destruction is more emotionally valuable than the help he would get at rehab.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a solution.\nSheldon: Great, what is it?\nLeonard: Get out.\nSheldon: Fine. (He leaves. A moment later he comes back.) I\xe2\x80\x99ve hesitated to point this out, but I must now remind you that we are in our current predicament because of your initial and totally inadequate deceit. I\xe2\x80\x99m just trying to clean up after your mess. (Leonard throws a glass ornament at him. He just manages to shut the door in time.) We\xe2\x80\x99ll talk in the morning.\nScene: The living room. Leonard enters in his dressing gown. There is a strange man eating cereal at the kitchen table.\nStrange man: Morning.\nLeonard: Who are you?\nMan: I am Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s cousin Leo.\nLeonard: Oh, God! Sheldon does not have a cousin Leo.\nMan: Au contraire. I\xe2\x80\x99m 26 years old, I\xe2\x80\x99m originally from (reads off crib notes) Denton, Texas, but I was a Navy brat so I was brought up on a variety of military bases around the world, as a result I\xe2\x80\x99ve often felt like an outsider, never really fitting in, which is probably the reason for my substance abuse problem.\nSheldon: Excuse me, we just went over this. As the quintessential middle child, your addiction is rooted in your unmet need for attention.\nMan: Oh, Sheldon, are we really going to go with pop psychology.\nSheldon: For your information, this is all based on solid research, stick with the character profile I wrote for you.\nLeonard: Sheldon?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, Leonard, this is Toby Loobenfeld, he\xe2\x80\x99s a research assistant in the particle physics lab, but he also minored in theatre at MIT.\nToby: It was more of a double major actually. Theatre and physics. You can guess which one my bourgeois parents pushed me towards.\nLeonard: Yeah, I got it, Sheldon, why?\nSheldon: Well, you see, while Leo would not have gone into rehab, it is completely plausible that we would have talked him into leaving the motel, and coming home with us.\nLeonard: Oh\xe2\x80\xa6!\nToby: Sheldon, how about this as my motivation. When I was fourteen years old I was abused in the Philippines by a club footed Navy chaplain.\nSheldon: No. We\xe2\x80\x99re going with middle child, and a generic predisposition to inadequate serotonin production.\nToby: Swell, how do I play genetic predisposition?\nSheldon: Subtextually, of course. (There is a knock on the door.) Just have fun with it. (Opening door.) Morning Penny.\nPenny: Hi. How did the intervention go.\nSheldon: Unfortunately, we weren\xe2\x80\x99t able to convince him to go to rehab.\nPenny: Well, based on what you told me, I\xe2\x80\x99m not surprised.\nSheldon: But we did convince him to leave the motel. Come say hello. Leo, this is Penny, our friend and neighbour.\nPenny: Hi Leo, how are you feeling?\nToby: Let me ask you something, Penny. Have you ever woken up in a fleabag motel, covered in your own vomit, next to a transsexual prostitute?\nPenny: No.\nToby: Then don\xe2\x80\x99t ask me how I\xe2\x80\x99m feeling.\nLeonard: Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s Leo. Hey, um, why don\xe2\x80\x99t you tell me about your showcase last night?\nPenny: Oh, it was okay I guess, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a big turn out but they both really seemed to like it.\nLeonard: There were only two people there?\nPenny: By the end. Yeah.\nToby: Damn you, Chaplain Horrigan!\nPenny: I\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\xa6 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.\nToby: The Philippines. 1992. The Subic Bay Naval Station. A young boy on the cusp of manhood. His only companions mongrel dogs and malarial mosquitos. Desperate and alone he reached out to a man who promised to introduce him to a merciful, loving God, but who instead introduced him to a gin pickled tongue shoved down his adolescent throat. What choice did he have but to drink, shoot and snort his pain away.\nSheldon: Don\xe2\x80\x99t forget his genetic predisposition towards addiction.\nToby: That\xe2\x80\x99s never been proven.\nSheldon: There have been studies.\nToby: Not double blind studies.\nSheldon: How could there be a double blind study, who would be the control group.\nLeonard: As you can see, detoxing can get pretty ugly, let\xe2\x80\x99s give them some privacy.\nPenny: Yeah. Hey, do you want to come over to my place, have coffee?\nLeonard: Sounds good.\nPenny: I have a video of me singing last night, do you want to see it?\nLeonard: Gee, why wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t I?\nPenny: This is even better than you coming to the showcase, because now I get to watch you watch me.\nLeonard: Yeah! Funny how things work out.\nToby: And that he loved the companionship and the wisdom that his own father failed to provide.\nSheldon: Your parents made the right decision.\nToby: I cannot work like this!\nScene: The apartment. Penny is on the sofa with Toby. They are watching TV.\nToby: This is amazing. Just sitting on a couch, watching TV with a woman. Not being drunk, or high, or\xe2\x80\xa6 or\xe2\x80\xa6 wondering if you\xe2\x80\x99re a dude down there.\nPenny: Leo, you are a very sweet, really funny guy. You\xe2\x80\x99re gonna do okay.\nToby: One day at a time, Penny, one day at a time.\nLeonard: How long is he going to stay here.\nSheldon: He\xe2\x80\x99s a homeless drug addict, Leonard, where is he going to go? Boy, you have a lot to learn about lying.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
