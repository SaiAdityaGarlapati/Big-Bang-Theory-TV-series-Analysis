b'Scene: The stairwell.\nLeonard: I was unstoppable. I mean, I was, I was on fire. It was like my mind and my body were totally connected, like, like athletes must feel when they\xe2\x80\x99re in the zone.\nPenny: Again, it was miniature golf.\nLeonard: Admit it, you\xe2\x80\x99re a little turned on.\nPenny: You can\xe2\x80\x99t be this proud.\nLeonard: Why not?\nPenny: Because I beat you.\nLeonard: Hey.\nPenny: Hi.\nSheldon: Oh, good. You\xe2\x80\x99re back.\nAmy: We have some exciting news.\nLeonard: Okay.\nSheldon: As you know, Amy and I have been together a long time, and a lot of things I never thought possible now seem possible.\nPenny: Okay.\nAmy: After a careful evaluation of our relationship, we decided that the time was right to take a step forward.\nLeonard: Okay.\nSheldon: Do you want to say it?\nAmy: Let\xe2\x80\x99s say it together.\nTogether: We\xe2\x80\x99re getting a turtle.\nPenny: This is why I\xe2\x80\x99ve been saying we should keep champagne on ice.\nSheldon: Sarcasm?\nAmy: Yes.\nSheldon: Okay. That was tricky, \xe2\x80\x99cause when it comes to alcohol, she generally means business.\nLeonard: Well, we\xe2\x80\x99re, we\xe2\x80\x99re very happy for you.\nPenny: Yes.\nAmy: Thank you. Acquiring a joint pet is a big step for us.\nSheldon: No. It\xe2\x80\x99s true. It means that we care so much about each other, there\xe2\x80\x99s enough left over for an eight-ounce reptile.\nLeonard: Why a turtle?\nSheldon: After much deliberation, we\xe2\x80\x99ve determined that a turtle is the ideal pet. They don\xe2\x80\x99t shed fur, they don\xe2\x80\x99t make noise.\nAmy: For Halloween, we can dress him as a cobblestone.\nSheldon: Yeah. And if he ever goes berserk, I know I can outrun him. Coincidentally, that\xe2\x80\x99s also why I chose you as a roommate.\nLeonard: Well, congratulations. Who would\xe2\x80\x99ve thought you two would be the first in our group to start a family?\nPenny: Mm-hmm.\nAmy: That\xe2\x80\x99s what I said.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: Emily\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nRaj: So, where\xe2\x80\x99s your roommate tonight?\nEmily: Well, I thought it was a little unfair that she\xe2\x80\x99s always here, and you never get a chance to stay over, so I killed her.\nRaj: But remember our agreement? You can joke about murdering people, but you have to say just kidding.\nEmily: And the more important thing to remember is that I\xe2\x80\x99d never hurt you. Oh, crap. I have to run over to the hospital and check on a patient.\nRaj: That\xe2\x80\x99s okay. I can come back later.\nEmily: No. No, don\xe2\x80\x99t be silly. I won\xe2\x80\x99t be gone long. Just stay here.\nRaj: Okay, cool. Oh, and you\xe2\x80\x99re sure your roommate\xe2\x80\x99s not gonna come back while I\xe2\x80\x99m here alone, right? \xe2\x80\x98Cause that\xe2\x80\x99ll be awkward.\nEmily: Oh, don\xe2\x80\x99t worry. She\xe2\x80\x99s in Palm Springs.\nRaj: Oh, good.\nEmily: Well, her torso is. Just kidding. I put her in a wood chipper.\nScene: A pet store.\nSheldon: Oh, dear Lord. Oh, dear Lord.\nAmy: It\xe2\x80\x99s okay. You made it. We\xe2\x80\x99re fine.\nSheldon: That was a lot of puppies.\nAmy: Let\xe2\x80\x99s forget about them, and pick ourselves out a nice turtle. Oh, how about this one up on the log?\nSheldon: Oh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. He kind of looks like a jerk. How about this one?\nAmy: Well, he\xe2\x80\x99s barely moving. He looks half dead.\nSheldon: I know. I like him, too. Hi, little guy. How\xe2\x80\x99d you like to come home with us? You\xe2\x80\x99ll be living with me because we don\xe2\x80\x99t live in the same house.\nAmy: But that\xe2\x80\x99s not your fault. Like you, we\xe2\x80\x99re taking it ridiculously slow. You\xe2\x80\x99ll stay with me when he\xe2\x80\x99s at Comic-Con or away for work.\nSheldon: Or if they accept Daddy\xe2\x80\x99s application to live on Mars.\nAmy: What are you talking about?\nSheldon: Oh, there\xe2\x80\x99s this company that\xe2\x80\x99s attempting to establish a colony on Mars, and I applied to be among the first to go. What should we name him? You know, I came in thinking Seth, but he kind of looks Italian.\nAmy: You applied for a mission to be a colonist on another planet, and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be bothered to tell me?\nSheldon: Would you have approved?\nAmy: Of course not.\nSheldon: Well, based on your reaction, it looks like I made the right choice. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that right, Giuseppe?\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: Hey, hey. Listen, I, I have a little confession to make.\nPenny: Aw, is this your first time?\nLeonard: No, I got you something for Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s Day, and I was too embarrassed to give it to you.\nPenny: Well, why?\nLeonard: Well, \xe2\x80\x99cause I got it at the dirty store.\nPenny: You went to the dirty store without me?\nLeonard: In sunglasses and a hat after I parked two blocks away.\nPenny: Well, get it. Get it for me.\nLeonard: Yeah?\nPenny: Yeah.\nLeonard: Okay, uh, well, I hope it\xe2\x80\x99s fun. I mean, it, it comes with paints, and, and it\xe2\x80\x99s kind of creative and artistic.\nPenny: Okay, did you go to the dirty store or Michaels?\nLeonard: No, no. We cover ourselves in body paint, and then, then we get on this big canvas and do our thing.\nPenny: Whoa, that\xe2\x80\x99s kind of a big step for a guy who only recently agreed to take his socks off.\nLeonard: You\xe2\x80\x99re making fun of me. Forget it.\nPenny: No. No, come on, I want to do it.\nLeonard: Really?\nPenny: Yeah, let\xe2\x80\x99s you, me, and your very, very pale feet make some art. Hey, when you got back to this store, I want to go with you.\nLeonard: Okay, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a drive, the one I went to is in San Diego.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nHoward: How are the taxes going?\nBernadette: Okay. But you got a lot of receipts for the Lego store in here.\nHoward: Those are business expenses. You can write those off.\nBernadette: A two hundred dollar R2-D2 is a business expense?\nHoward: Oh, Bernie, you\xe2\x80\x99re gonna have to sound a lot more confident when we get audited. (On phone) Hey, what\xe2\x80\x99s up?\nRaj: Oh, Emily ran back to the hospital, so I\xe2\x80\x99m just hanging out at her place. What are you, uh, what are you doing?\nHoward: Just playing video games while Bernie does the taxes.\nRaj: What are you, a little kid? Is she gonna cut your dinner into little pieces, too?\nHoward: She doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have to, I filled up on jelly beans.\nRaj: So, uh, what game are you\xe2\x80\xa6 Oh. Crap.\nHoward: What\xe2\x80\x99s wrong?\nRaj: I can\xe2\x80\x99t get Emily\xe2\x80\x99s night-stand to close.\nHoward: So?\nRaj: She\xe2\x80\x99s gonna know I was looking in it.\nHoward: Why were you looking in it?\nRaj: Well, there\xe2\x80\x99s a question I better have a good answer to before she gets back.\nHoward: Okay, calm down. There\xe2\x80\x99s probably something jammed behind it. Just, uh, pull it out and see what\xe2\x80\x99s there.\nRaj: Hang on. Oh no. Oh, no. Oh, God, no.\nHoward: You know what, you sound busy, I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna let you go.\nRaj: Dude, the whole front came off. Now she\xe2\x80\x99s gonna know I was snooping.\nBernadette: What\xe2\x80\x99s happening?\nHoward: Raj was snooping through Emily\xe2\x80\x99s drawers and broke one.\nBernadette: Aw. I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna miss her.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom.\nPenny: So what do you think?\nLeonard: I thought it\xe2\x80\x99d be a little more, just more.\nPenny: I\xe2\x80\x99m not even sure why we were out of breath. Uh, I mean, did we move at all?\nLeonard: Maybe along the z-axis, but x and y are looking pretty sad.\nPenny: Okay, come on. We are not old boring people. We can do better than this.\nLeonard: Uh, Th, that\xe2\x80\x99s true. How late did we stay up last night?\nPenny: Almost 1am.\nLeonard: Damn straight, almost 1am. And we weren\xe2\x80\x99t even watching TV. We were watching Netflix, like the kids do.\nPenny: Yeah, is it a comedy? Is it a drama? Nobody knows. Now, come on. We are gonna do this.\nLeonard: Yeah. You get the paint, I\xe2\x80\x99ll rest for 30 to 40 minutes, and then we do this.\nScene: The stairwell.\nSheldon: I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe you almost had me bring a wild animal into my home.\nAmy: No one told you to poke the turtle\xe2\x80\x99s face.\nSheldon: I was playing Got Your Nose. That\xe2\x80\x99s how you get children to like you.\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99m surprised you even care if he likes you, since you\xe2\x80\x99re planning on leaving the planet the first chance you get.\nSheldon: Ugh, this again. Amy, I\xe2\x80\x99ve already had one new hole torn in my body today. I don\xe2\x80\x99t need another one.\nAmy: Sheldon, I know the odds of you even going to Mars are incredibly small, but it still hurts that you would volunteer for something that would take you away from me forever.\nSheldon: So you\xe2\x80\x99re saying you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t leave me for the chance to be one of the first humans to colonize another planet?\nAmy: I would at least mention it before filling out the application.\nSheldon: Huh, that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what Leonard, Wolowitz, Koothrappali, Bernadette and Penny said.\nAmy: And who says you could even survive an interplanetary mission, anyway? You could barely survive a tiny turtle bite.\nSheldon: First of all, this has only made me stronger. But beyond that, all I did was fill out an application.\nAmy: You know what? Go to Mars, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Is there anything I can do to cheer you up?\nAmy: No. Forget it.\nSheldon: What if I play the Star Trek theme on my nose?\nAmy: Please don\xe2\x80\x99t.\nSheldon: Yep, you\xe2\x80\x99re mad.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s apartment. Howard is on the phone to Raj.\nHoward: Okay, let me see the damage.\nRaj: Hang on.\nHoward: Well, I think you broke the dowels. You\xe2\x80\x99re not gonna have time to glue it back on, you\xe2\x80\x99ll have to nail it.\nRaj: With what?\nHoward: Does she have any pillows or wine glasses?\nRaj: She does.\nHoward: Great. Neither of those. Try a hammer.\nRaj: Did that feel good? You feel like a big man now?\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: I was going to make you red zinger, but since Mars is the red planet, I went with peppermint.\nAmy: Why do you even want to do this?\nSheldon: Actually, as part of the application, I was required to make a short video answering that very question. You want to see it?\nAmy: Can\xe2\x80\x99t you just tell me?\nSheldon: But I made a video.\nSheldon (on video): I\xe2\x80\x99m Dr. Sheldon Cooper, and I\xe2\x80\x99d like to tell you why I should be chosen to go to Mars. I\xe2\x80\x99m exceedingly smart. I graduated college at 14. While my brother was getting an STD I was getting a PhD. Penicillin can\xe2\x80\x99t take this away. Being in close quarters, cleanliness is important and my hygiene is impeccable. In fact, animals don\xe2\x80\x99t trust me because I smell like nothing. Literally nothing. During the seven-month space flight, I can keep up morale with my wacky sense of humour. Hey, Leonard, is there any peanut brittle left in that can?\nLeonard (on video): You mean this weirdly suspicious one?\nSheldon (on video): Yes. Open it and check.\nLeonard (on video): I don\xe2\x80\x99t get it. There\xe2\x80\x99s actually peanut brittle in\xe2\x80\xa6 Please go to Mars.\nSheldon (on video): But on a more serious note, the most important reason I want to go to Mars is that I believe, as a scientist, it\xe2\x80\x99s my duty to push the boundaries of human knowledge forward. Now, I know that life on Mars will be difficult. But life here on Earth is no picnic. Also, picnics are no picnic. Where should we go for lunch? Oh, I know, the ground. In conclusion, thank you for considering me for this journey of a lifetime. To Mars.\nSheldon: Afterwards, Leonard blew his nose, and pie came out.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s bathroom.\nLeonard: Right there, right there, Oh, God, that\xe2\x80\x99s it.\nPenny: How did you get paint in your eye?\nLeonard: Because you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t let me wear safety goggles.\nScene: Emily\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom. Raj is still on the phone with Howard.\nRaj: This looks terrible. She, she\xe2\x80\x99s gonna know.\nHoward: It\xe2\x80\x99s fine. You just need two more nails.\nRaj: Okay, where should I put them?\nHoward: In Emily\xe2\x80\x99s eyes.\nRaj: You\xe2\x80\x99re not helping.\nBernadette: Well, maybe this is what you get for snooping.\nRaj: You know, it, it\xe2\x80\x99s bad enough that I have to deal with this\xe2\x80\xa6\nEmily: Raj? I\xe2\x80\x99m back.\nRaj: Oh, no. Hey.\nEmily: Hi.\nRaj: How was the hospital?\nEmily: Fine. What were you doing in there?\nRaj: Uh w, well, okay, look, I, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to lie to you. I got curious, I was looking around and I broke the drawer on your night stand.\nEmily: You were looking in my night stand?\nRaj: Yeah.\nEmily: So, the first time I leave you alone, you snoop on me?\nRaj: You\xe2\x80\x99ve never snooped around my apartment?\nEmily: No.\nRaj: Come on, think back. It would really help if you had.\nEmily: I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe you don\xe2\x80\x99t trust me.\nBernadette: She sounds really mad.\nHoward: We should hang up.\nBernadette: Yeah, we should.\nHoward: But we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to, are we?\nBernadette: Not a chance.\nHoward: What happened to snooping is wrong?\nBernadette: Howard, you\xe2\x80\x99re going to jail for tax fraud. Who cares?\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom.\nLeonard: Well, we did it.\nPenny: We sure did.\nLeonard: I mean, I was on fire. I, I was in the zone, like an athlete.\nPenny: Sweetie, I beat you at this, too.\nLeonard: So, where do we want to hang it?\nPenny: What? Are you kidding? We\xe2\x80\x99re not hanging it.\nLeonard: But it\xe2\x80\x99s an expression of our love.\nPenny: And our butts. Not hanging it.\nLeonard: Seems a shame to throw it away.\nPenny: Yeah. We could give it to Sheldon, and tell him William Shatner painted it.\nLeonard: God, I love you. I love you so much.\nScene: The apartment.\nAmy: I think I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna go home.\nSheldon: Why? I really don\xe2\x80\x99t understand what\xe2\x80\x99s happening here.\nAmy: You know, Sheldon, at any other time, learning that you had plans to go live on Mars would be a slow news day. But a couple of hours ago, we were getting a turtle. And silly as it sounds, I thought that meant something.\nSheldon: Amy. Oh, why didn\xe2\x80\x99t I give her Sleepy Time tea? Amy, wait. Getting a turtle meant a great deal to me, too.\nAmy: Sure. Unless something better comes along.\nSheldon: Do you want me to withdraw my application?\nAmy: What I want is for us to be planning our future together.\nSheldon: And in that future, are we on the same planet? Because I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen people make the long-distance thing work.\nAmy: We\xe2\x80\x99re on the same planet.\nSheldon: Okay. Does that planet have to be Earth?\nAmy: Are you asking me to go to Mars with you?\nSheldon: I am. Yeah, if I\xe2\x80\x99m going to a barren, lifeless environment where the chances of survival are slim to none, I want you there with me. Why don\xe2\x80\x99t we go back to the apartment, and fill out your application?\nAmy: Okay. I suppose being the first people on a new planet would be incredibly exciting.\nSheldon: Oh, I know. We could be the first to plant a flag on Mars. We could be the first to watch Mars Attacks! on Mars. We could be the first to say good lord, what on Mars are you talking about?\nAmy: You know, we could also be the first people to procreate on Mars.\nSheldon: You just can\xe2\x80\x99t keep it in your space pants, can you?\nAmy: Think about it. If we had a family there, our kids would be Martians.\nSheldon: They would, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t they? We could give them cool Martian names. And we could teach them about Martian history. Like, who planted those flags? And, uh, where did that copy of Mars Attacks! come from?\nAmy: I guess we\xe2\x80\x99ll have to make a new video together, as a couple.\nSheldon: Good idea. And since you\xe2\x80\x99ve had such a rough day, I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna let you throw the pie in Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s face.\nScene: Emily\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom.\nRaj: Thank you for forgiving me.\nEmily: That\xe2\x80\x99s okay. At some point, we were bound to have our first fight.\nRaj: Well, it almost happened when you called my apple pie crust doughy, but the truth is you were right, and I was just angry at myself.\nEmily: Can I ask you one thing?\nRaj: Of course. What?\nEmily: Did you look in my closet?\nRaj: No. Just the drawer.\nEmily: You promise you didn\xe2\x80\x99t look in the closet?\nRaj: I promise. Why, what\xe2\x80\x99s in there?\nEmily: Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry about it. Good night.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
