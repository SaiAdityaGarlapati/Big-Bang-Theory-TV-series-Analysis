b'Scene: The apartment. Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s mother is visiting.\nLeonard: So what kind of cruise is this you\xe2\x80\x99re going on?\nMrs Cooper: It\xe2\x80\x99s called the Born Again Boat Ride. Christian Quarterly gave it their highest rating, five thorny crowns. I do wish you\xe2\x80\x99d come with me, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Well, Mom, if I did, it would be conclusive proof that your God can work miracles.\nMrs Cooper: You\xe2\x80\x99re missing out. It\xe2\x80\x99s gonna be wall-to-wall fun. It\xe2\x80\x99s all themed. There\xe2\x80\x99s Jonah and the Whale Watching, all-you-can-eat Last Supper Buffet, and my personal favourite, Gunning with God.\nLeonard: What\xe2\x80\x99s Gunning with God? I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid to ask.\nMrs Cooper: Oh, it is a hoot and a half. You write your sins on a clay pigeon, they fire \xe2\x80\x99em up in the air, and you pulverize them with a 12-gauge shotgun full of our Lord\xe2\x80\x99s forgiveness.\nSheldon: Frankly, Mom, I\xe2\x80\x99m encouraged to see how advanced your group has become, willing to sail out into the ocean without fear of falling off the edge.\nMrs Cooper: For example, if Shelly was aboard, he\xe2\x80\x99d write \xe2\x80\x9csmart mouth\xe2\x80\x9d on his pigeon, and then bam!\nSheldon: The Lord giveth and the Lord bloweth away. Well, Mom, according to my itinerary for our weekend together, the fun begins with fried chicken.\nMrs Cooper: Sounds delicious.\nSheldon: Good, \xe2\x80\x99cause I got you everything you need to make it. You are in for a treat. My mother\xe2\x80\x99s fried chicken is why we had to buy my dad the extra large coffin.\nLeonard: Sheldon, she just got off the plane. She doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to cook.\nSheldon: Of course she does. Making me food is her way of saying I love you. Making me food when she\xe2\x80\x99s too tired to cook is her way of saying I really love you.\nMrs Cooper: Actually, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t mind going out for a bite, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Won\xe2\x80\x99t that spoil our appetites for the chicken you\xe2\x80\x99re going to make me?\nLeonard: All right, that settles it, we\xe2\x80\x99re going out. Do you like sushi? There\xe2\x80\x99s a great little place down the street.\nMrs Cooper: I\xe2\x80\x99ve never had it, but there\xe2\x80\x99s no harm in trying something new.\nSheldon: There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of harm in trying something new. That\xe2\x80\x99s why we test out drugs and cosmetics on bunny rabbits.\nLeonard: Sheldon, you\xe2\x80\x99re talking like a crazy person.\nMrs Cooper: Actually, I had him tested as a child. Doctor says he\xe2\x80\x99s fine.\nSheldon: Told you.\nMrs Cooper: Although, I do regret not following up with that specialist in Houston.\nCredits Sequence.\nScene: A sushi bar.\nAll: Irasshaimase!\nSheldon: Stop yelling! I\xe2\x80\x99m not happy about this.\nLeonard: What\xe2\x80\x99s the last thing you were ever happy about?\nSheldon: The prospect of fried chicken.\nMrs Cooper: This is exciting. Back home, the diner on Route Four serves sushi, but it\xe2\x80\x99s just cut up fish sticks and a side of Uncle Ben\xe2\x80\x99s. They put it on the menu in those kung fu letters, but that don\xe2\x80\x99t make it sushi.\nLeonard: Uh, kung fu letters might not be politically correct.\nMrs Cooper: Oh, I thought the one we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t say was ching chong.\nLeonard: Yeah, yeah, that, too.\nMrs Cooper: So, Shelly, what\xe2\x80\x99s up with you and your friend Amy, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind a mother prying a bit?\nSheldon: Well, there\xe2\x80\x99s actually big news on the Amy front. She\xe2\x80\x99s been studying the neurobiology of addiction in lower animals. She is this close to getting a starfish hooked on cocaine.\nMrs Cooper: Do you have any idea what\xe2\x80\x99s going on with those two?\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s kind of like the Loch Ness monster. Maybe there\xe2\x80\x99s something there, maybe there isn\xe2\x80\x99t. We\xe2\x80\x99ll probably never know. But sometimes it\xe2\x80\x99s fun to creep yourself out thinking about it.\nMrs Cooper: How are you doing on the young lady front? I hear you\xe2\x80\x99re in some sort of a long distance situation?\nLeonard: Uh, yeah, it\xe2\x80\x99s Raj\xe2\x80\x99s sister. It\xe2\x80\x99s kind of tough. She\xe2\x80\x99s in India. Also, her parents aren\xe2\x80\x99t happy she\xe2\x80\x99s dating someone white.\nMrs Cooper: Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s a funny turn, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? You never think about it going the other way. Well, you can\xe2\x80\x99t force things. You need to figure out if you\xe2\x80\x99re in a relationship or if you\xe2\x80\x99re just calling it one. It\xe2\x80\x99s like they say, a cat can have kittens in the oven but that don\xe2\x80\x99t make \xe2\x80\x99em biscuits.\nSheldon: And that reminds me of another saying. You can lead a chicken to Crisco, but you can\xe2\x80\x99tmake your mother fry it.\nMrs Cooper: Sheldon, you pester me one more time about chicken, I will put you over my knee right here in this restaurant.\nLeonard: Please pester her. Please, for me.\nScene: The stairwell.\nLeonard: So, Mrs. Cooper, what did you think of the sushi?\nMrs Cooper: It was good. The only thing that would have made it better is if it was cooked and if it was beef. Sheldon, when is your landlord going to fix the elevator?\nSheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Lately we\xe2\x80\x99ve been talking about converting it into a missile silo.\nLeonard: Your son seems to think we need to launch a pre-emptive strike on Burbank.\nSheldon: Get them before they get us.\nRaj (Sitting against their front door, drinking a beer): Hey, look who decided to show up.\nLeonard: Raj, what are you doing?\nRaj: I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t find you guys so I bought six new friends. Three, sadly, are dead.\nSheldon: Mom, you remember Rajesh? Rajesh, my mother.\nRaj: Of course. Mrs. Cooper. So nice to see you again.\nMrs Cooper: Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s so nice to see you, too. I thought it was our Indians that had the occasional alcohol problem.\nLeonard: We don\xe2\x80\x99t say that, either. I\xe2\x80\x99ll make you a list.\nMrs Cooper: Oh, that would be mighty white of you. So, Raj, what pain are you trying to cover up with alcohol?\nRaj: Nothing, I\xe2\x80\x99m fine.\nMrs Cooper: Are ya?\nRaj: No. (Bursts into tears)\nMrs Cooper: That\xe2\x80\x99s better. Now tell me what\xe2\x80\x99s bothering you.\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99m so lonely.\nSheldon: Oh, yes, born alone, die alone. It\xe2\x80\x99s a tragic human condition. Now, Raj, if you\xe2\x80\x99ll excuse my mother, she\xe2\x80\x99s about to make a pecan pie that\xe2\x80\x99ll be so good I\xe2\x80\x99ll almost forget how she blew it with the fried chicken.\nMrs Cooper: Sheldon, your friend is hurtin\xe2\x80\x99. What do we do when someone\xe2\x80\x99s hurtin\xe2\x80\x99?\nSheldon: Offer them a hot beverage.\nMrs Cooper: And when they\xe2\x80\x99re drunk as a skunk, what beverage do we offer?\nSheldon: Coffee.\nMrs Cooper: And what do we do it with? (Sheldon fixes a large false smile.) Now you listen to me. I know you feel like you can\xe2\x80\x99t find someone, but there\xe2\x80\x99s a lock for every key. Back home, there\xe2\x80\x99s a girl works at the Wal-Mart. Tall, tall girl. Woman could hunt geese with a rake. Thought she\xe2\x80\x99d never find a man, then one day, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t ya know, Harlem Globetrotters come to town. Long story short, today that woman travels the world with a semi-professional basketball player and two beautiful mixed-race babies.\nRaj: I didn\xe2\x80\x99t get a lot of that because of your accent, but the general tone was soothing and somehow I feel better.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get my pecan pie, am I?\nLeonard: You want some Oreos?\nSheldon: Double Stuf?\nLeonard: No, regular.\nSheldon: Nice. Kick a man when he\xe2\x80\x99s down.\nScene: The laundry room.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m glad we\xe2\x80\x99re finally getting to do something together, just the two of us.\nMrs Cooper: Sure. One thing you really miss when you\xe2\x80\x99re on vacation is laundry.\nSheldon: Careful, you\xe2\x80\x99re using too much Downey. You know if my clothes get too soft it makes me sleepy.\nMrs Cooper: Well, this takes me back. Me doing your laundry, you next to me criticizing.\nSheldon: It is nice, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\nPenny (arriving): Mrs. Cooper. Hi!\nMrs Cooper: Oh, hello, darlin\xe2\x80\x99.\nPenny: Sheldon, you didn\xe2\x80\x99t tell me your mom was coming.\nSheldon: It was in my weekly e-mail blast. Right between beet season is finally here, and uh-oh, red stool from beets leads to cancer scare.\nMrs Cooper: So, how\xe2\x80\x99ve you been?\nPenny: Good, good.\nMrs Cooper: I hear that Leonard has a new girlfriend. How are you doing with all that?\nPenny: Oh, fine. You know, it\xe2\x80\x99s been a while. I\xe2\x80\x99m getting back out there.\nMrs Cooper: Let me ask you, when you get back out there, are you wearing this? (Holds up a skimpy top)\nPenny: Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s super cute on. That top has paid for itself in free drinks like ten times what it cost.\nSheldon: Yes, Penny has a lot of her money tied up in promiscuity futures.\nMrs Cooper: Hon, you think maybe the reason why you\xe2\x80\x99re having trouble finding a guy to settle down with is because you\xe2\x80\x99re letting them ride the roller coaster without buying a ticket?\nPenny: Oh, they don\xe2\x80\x99t always get to ride the roller coaster. Sometimes they only get to spin the teacups. Now I\xe2\x80\x99m going out tonight. Would it be crazy to ask you to look at the outfit I\xe2\x80\x99m going to wear?\nMrs Cooper: Oh, not crazy at all. And don\xe2\x80\x99t beat yourself up. When I was your age, you could have me for a car ride and a bottle of strawberry wine.\nSheldon: Now that will not be in this week\xe2\x80\x99s e-mail blast.\nScene: The apartment.\nHoward: So, this spring, I get to go to the International Space Station.\nMrs Cooper: Oh, my word, a trip to the heavens. If you ever want to live there eternally, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a good book you could read.\nHoward: Thanks, but I watch the Charlie Brown Christmas special every year, so I get the gist.\nMrs Cooper: I bet your mom is really proud of you.\nHoward: Nope. She says if I don\xe2\x80\x99t back out she\xe2\x80\x99s going to go on a hunger strike. It would take years before she\xe2\x80\x99d be in any kind of danger, but still.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a treat for us tomorrow, Mom. I\xe2\x80\x99m taking you to see Saul Perlmutter give a lecture about his Nobel Prize-winning work in cosmology. And the best part is, at the Q and A afterward, I\xe2\x80\x99ve worked up a couple of Q\xe2\x80\x99s that will stump his sorry A.\nMrs Cooper: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, Shelly. I thought we could do a little sightseeing.\nSheldon: What sight is better than your little boy embarrassing a Nobel laureate?\nMrs Cooper: Come on, Sheldon, we\xe2\x80\x99ll take your mom to see the Hollywood sign, the wax museum, the Walk of Fame.\nPenny: Ooh, maybe a little Rodeo Drive.\nMrs Cooper: Well, I can\xe2\x80\x99t spend twelve thousand dollars on a handbag, but it\xe2\x80\x99s free to look upon those who do with righteous condemnation.\nHoward: What do you say?\nSheldon: What do I say? I say you people need to stop ruining my mom\xe2\x80\x99s visit with your sushi, and your sadness and your slutty shirts. Stop it.\nHoward (after Raj whispers to him): He\xe2\x80\x99s not talking about your shirt. Your shirt is fine.\nScene: The kitchen.\nLeonard: These are delicious.\nMrs Cooper: The trick to pancakes is bacon grease. I cook everything in it.\nLeonard: Everything? Aren\xe2\x80\x99t you worried about your health?\nMrs Cooper: Oh, doctors are always changing their mind. One week bacon grease is bad for you. The next week we\xe2\x80\x99re not getting enough of it. Good morning, Shelly.\nSheldon: Mom, I want to apologize for my behaviour last night.\nMrs Cooper: Apology accepted.\nSheldon: Great. Now, you\xe2\x80\x99re going to love the Perlmutter lecture. Look, he will be stating that the universe is older than 6,000 years, but I thought you could stick your fingers in your ears and hum Amazing Grace during those parts.\nMrs Cooper: I am still going out with your friends.\nSheldon: But I apologized. And that was hard for me because I didn\xe2\x80\x99t do anything wrong.\nMrs Cooper: Shelly, I hung out with you in enough dusty lecture halls while you were growing up. I want to go sightseeing. So why don\xe2\x80\x99t you have some pancakes, get dressed and come with us.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m not going, and you can\xe2\x80\x99t make me.\nMrs Cooper: You\xe2\x80\x99re right, I can\xe2\x80\x99t. Have a nice day.\nSheldon: Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to stand here until you change your mind.\nMrs Cooper: Well, then you are going to stand there all day.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m just gonna take my bacon grease and slide over there.\nSheldon: I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe my own mother is abandoning me.\nMrs Cooper: I am not abandoning you. Sheldon, abandoning you is leaving you in a basket on a church doorstep. I am going to Hollywood and thank a wax Ronald Reagan for his service to our country.\nSheldon: We appear to be at a crossroads in our relationship, Mother.\nMrs Cooper: Well, I guess we are.\nLeonard: Sorry. Syrup.\nSheldon: All right, Mom. When you\xe2\x80\x99re at the Ripley\xe2\x80\x99s Believe It Or Not Museum, if they have an exhibit about a mother who threw away a chance to spend the day with the world\xe2\x80\x99s most wonderful son, believe it, because it\xe2\x80\x99s true. (Grabs pancakes and snatches syrup from Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s hand)\nLeonard: I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\xa6\nScene: Amy\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nSheldon: That lecture was a waste of time. I made more accurate diagrams of the expansion of the early universe on the nursery wall with the contents of my diaper. (Sneezes)\nAmy: Are you getting sick?\nSheldon: No, I\xe2\x80\x99m just allergic to people who get Nobel Prizes for no good reason.\nAmy: Sheldon, is it possible that your foul mood, or, to use the clinical term, bitchiness, is because your mother isn\xe2\x80\x99t making you a priority?\nSheldon: No. Or to use the clinical term, nuh-uh.\nAmy: Are you sure? The infant-mother pair-bond is the building block of primate psychology.\nSheldon: Oh, there it is. It always comes back to monkeys with you. Just monkeys, monkeys, monkeys.\nAmy: Sheldon, we\xe2\x80\x99re all animals. And granted, there are aspects of you that are extraordinary, but when it comes to emotions and relationships, you\xe2\x80\x99re just like everybody else.\nSheldon: Are you trying to suggest that my emotional problems are no different than those of a stupid person?\nAmy: Actually, some research indicates that by not over-thinking, the less intelligent handle emotions better. (He sneezes again) Sure you\xe2\x80\x99re not coming down with a cold?\nSheldon: Oh, yes, the common cold. Just like everyone else. You\xe2\x80\x99d love that, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you?\nScene: A church.\nMrs Cooper: Oh, this one\xe2\x80\x99s sweet. You know, for your rosary rattlers.\nLeonard: Mrs. Cooper, we say Catholics, not rosary rattlers.\nMrs Cooper: My goodness, it\xe2\x80\x99s a wonder you people in California can talk at all.\nPenny: This is like the worst Hollywood tour ever.\nLeonard: What are you gonna do? She wanted to see churches.\nPenny: Hey, they have wine here, don\xe2\x80\x99t they?\nRaj (pointing at a crucifixion statue): Hey, none of our gods have abs like that.\nHoward: Yep, that\xe2\x80\x99s the last Jew who did sit-ups. And look where it got him.\nMrs Cooper: Hey, while we\xe2\x80\x99re here, why don\xe2\x80\x99t we all do some praying? Let\xe2\x80\x99s put a little church in this church.\nLeonard: Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure we should.\nMrs Cooper: It\xe2\x80\x99s easy. I\xe2\x80\x99ll show you how. Lord, Mary Cooper here. Coming to you from Gomorrah, California. I want to thank you for the blessing that is my little Shelly. I also want to thank you for the continued strength not to coldcock him with my Bible. All right, Penny, your turn.\nPenny: Okay, um, hey, God. What\xe2\x80\x99s up? Um, I\xe2\x80\x99m good, but, uh, it would be a big help to my family if you could get my brother to stop cooking meth. But no cops. Be cool.\nMrs Cooper: She also goes a little overboard on the love thy neighbour. Could probably use that chat you had with Mary Magdalene. Leonard, you\xe2\x80\x99re up. Wasserman, you\xe2\x80\x99re on deck.\nLeonard: Okay. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, it\xe2\x80\x99s probably a little late to ask you to make me taller. Oh, um, if you could help out with me and my girlfriend. She\xe2\x80\x99s all the way in India. That would be great.\nMrs Cooper: Hear that? Girl trouble. Turns out we were both wrong on that front. How about you?\nHoward: Oh, me? No. Thanks, I\xe2\x80\x99m good. I\xe2\x80\x99m really just trying not to burst into flames.\nMrs Cooper: Rajesh?\nHoward: He says he\xe2\x80\x99s having trouble dropping those last five pounds.\nMrs Cooper: Huh, I might have gone with the talking-to-girls thing.\nHoward: No, you only get one wish.\nScene: A park bench. Sheldon is sitting. A stranger sits next to him.\nSheldon: Look at the two of us. Me, a highly regarded physicist. The kind of mind that comes along once, maybe twice in a generation. You, the common man, tired from your labours as a stockbroker, or vacuum cleaner salesman, or bootblack. But deep down inside, apparently we\xe2\x80\x99re just two peas in a pod. A regular pea, and the kind of pea that comes along once, maybe twice in a generation. Rain. Another great equalizer. Falling on the head of the brilliant and the unremarkable alike. (The stranger puts up an umbrella) Smarty-pants.\nScene: The kitchen.\nPenny: Oh, Mrs. Cooper, it smells so good.\nMrs Cooper: You take notes, darlin\xe2\x80\x99. The real way to get a man is with melted cheese and cream of mushroom soup. He\xe2\x80\x99ll die at 50 but his love will be true.\nSheldon (entering, soaked): I need a tissue.This one got wet.\nLeonard: Here.\nSheldon: Thank you. Yeah, I\xe2\x80\x99ve learned something today. You and I, in so many ways, other than intelligence and what counts, we\xe2\x80\x99re the same. (Sneezes)\nMrs Cooper: Sweetheart, are you sick?\nSheldon: I hope so, because if this is well, life isn\xe2\x80\x99t worth living.\nMrs Cooper: Oh, sugarpie, you are burning up. We\xe2\x80\x99ve got to get you to bed.\nSheldon: Okay.\nMrs Cooper: Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry. Mama\xe2\x80\x99s here to take care of her baby.\nSheldon: And just to be clear, only her baby and not these other people.\nMrs Cooper: Of course.\nSheldon: Can I have tea with honey and toast with the crust cut off?\nMrs Cooper: You can have whatever you want.\nSheldon: Thanks, Mom.You\xe2\x80\x99re the best.\nScene: Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom.\nMrs Cooper: Boy, last time I put VapoRub on you, you didn\xe2\x80\x99t have hair on your chest.\nSheldon: I know, it filled in last year. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t get to spend a lot of time with you on this visit.\nMrs Cooper: And whose fault was that?\nSheldon: Yours.\nMrs Cooper: Shelly, you\xe2\x80\x99re not eight years old any more. We have to have a different relationship.\nSheldon: No, we don\xe2\x80\x99t. The one we have works great.\nMrs Cooper: Sweetheart, you are a grown man.\nSheldon: Or maybe I\xe2\x80\x99m part of a new species, that lives for hundreds of years, which means I\xe2\x80\x99m still basically a toddler.\nMrs Cooper: Oh, I so should have taken you to Houston.\nSheldon: Does this mean you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to sing Soft Kitty?\nMrs Cooper: No, I will always sing you Soft Kitty. (Sings) Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur\xe2\x80\xa6\nLeonard (at door): Mrs. Cooper, were we supposed to take that pie out of the oven?\nSheldon: Get out!\nMrs Cooper: Well, that was rude.\nSheldon: Well, I know, but he means well. Sing.\nMrs Cooper: Happy kitty, sleepy kitty\xe2\x80\xa6\nSheldon: What are you trying to pull, Mom? From the top.\nMrs Cooper (to God): This is what I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about. (Sings) Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur\xe2\x80\xa6\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
