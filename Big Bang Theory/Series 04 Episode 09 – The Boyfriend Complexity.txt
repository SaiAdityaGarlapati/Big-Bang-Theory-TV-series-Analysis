b'Scene: The apartment.\nRaj: You know who\xe2\x80\x99s got to be the bravest person in the Marvel Universe? Whoever has to give She-Hulk a bikini wax.\nHoward: You want to talk brave, how about Captain America\xe2\x80\x99s undocumented Mexican gardener?\nLeonard: He\xe2\x80\x99s not braver than whoever uses the bathroom after The Thing?\nSheldon: As usual, you\xe2\x80\x99re all wrong. The bravest person in the Marvel Universe is the doctor who gives Wolverine his prostate exam.\nHoward: How about the guy who gets a prostate exam from Wolverine?\nSheldon: Now you just being silly. Wolverine\xe2\x80\x99s never displayed the slightest interest in helping others prevent prostate cancer. (Answering phone) Hello. Yes, the elevator\xe2\x80\x99s out of order you\xe2\x80\x99ll have to use the stairs. Of course you can. Pizza dates back to the 16th century, while the first elevator was not installed until 1852. That means that for over 300 years, people carried pizzas up stairs. Be part of that proud tradition.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99ll go get Penny while that guy spits on our food.\nRaj: Do you think they gave Wolverine an Adamantium prostate?\nHoward: That\xe2\x80\x99s a stupid question.\nRaj: We\xe2\x80\x99re having a conversation about probing the heinies of superheroes. There are no stupid questions.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s door.\n  Man: Yes?\nLeonard: Oh, um, is Penny here?\nMan: You\xe2\x80\x99re Leonard, right?\nLeonard: Yeah.\nMan: Damn, it\xe2\x80\x99s good to finally meet you, son.\nLeonard: Okay, I think a bit of context here might help.\nPenny: Oh, hey, Leonard. I see you met my dad.\nLeonard: Oh, good. Context.\nPenny\xe2\x80\x99s Dad: Come on in, buddy. Take a load off.\nPenny: Oh, gee, dad, Leonard can\xe2\x80\x99t stay. He just dropped by to say hello. Thanks for stopping by, sweetie. I\xe2\x80\x99ll see you later. (Kisses him passionately) Bye.\nLeonard: That was odd.\nCredits sequence.\n  Scene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Are you sure you have enough comics? You\xe2\x80\x99re going to be monitoring the telescope for 12 hours, and by my estimate, you\xe2\x80\x99ve only selected seven hours of reading material. That\xe2\x80\x99s even factoring in your difficulty in parsing American comic book idioms like Bamf and Snikt.\nRaj: Is that racist? It feels racist.\nHoward: Don\xe2\x80\x99t be oversensitive. He\xe2\x80\x99s calling you illiterate, not your race.\nRaj: Oh, okay. Good. I don\xe2\x80\x99t need more comics. Howard\xe2\x80\x99s gonna stop by, we\xe2\x80\x99re gonna play intergalactic battleship and Indian Monopoly.\nSheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t care for novelty editions of Monopoly. I prefer the classics, regular and Klingon.\nHoward: Actually, Indian Monopoly\xe2\x80\x99s just like regular, except the money\xe2\x80\x99s in Rupees, instead of hotels you build call centers, and when you pick a chance card, you might die of dysentery. Just FYI, that was racist.\nLeonard: You\xe2\x80\x99ll never guess what just happened.\nSheldon: You went out in the hallway, stumbled into an interdimensional portal which brought you 5,000 years into the future, where you took advantage of the advanced technology to build a time machine, and now you\xe2\x80\x99re back to bring us all with you to the year 7010 where we are transported to work at the thinkatorium by telepathically controlled flying dolphins?\nLeonard: No.\nSheldon: Aw.\nLeonard: Penny kissed me.\nSheldon: Well, who would ever guess that?\nRaj: What\xe2\x80\xa6 what kind of a kiss?\nLeonard: A big kiss. On the mouth.\nHoward: Is it possible that she was going for your cheek and you moved and she accidentally got lip? That happens with me and my mom all the time.\nLeonard: She introduced me to her father, kissed me and then shut the door in my face.\nHoward:Maybe she was trying to send you a message.\nLeonard: You think?\nHoward: Yeah. This man is not my father. I\xe2\x80\x99m being held hostage. So I\xe2\x80\x99m going to do something insane in the hopes that you\xe2\x80\x99ll call 911.\nLeonard: Penny kissing me is not insane. She used to kiss me all the time.\nSheldon: Einstein defined insanity as doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. By that standard, Penny is cuckoo for cocoa puffs.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m just saying, it felt like it may have meant something.\nHoward: Ah, this takes me back. Leonard obsessing about Penny. I mean, don\xe2\x80\x99t get me wrong, I love your new stuff, but once in a while it\xe2\x80\x99s nice to hear the hits.\nRaj: Ooh, ooh! Do our babies will be smart and beautiful. That one always makes me laugh.\nLeonard: Why do I bother talking to you people?\nSheldon: If it\xe2\x80\x99ll make you feel better, we rarely listen.\nPenny (at door): Hey, can I talk to you out here for a sec?\nLeonard: Yeah, sure.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m starting to think we\xe2\x80\x99re never going to see that pizza.\nPenny: So you\xe2\x80\x99re probably wondering what that was all about.\nLeonard: What, uh, the kissing and everything? Nah, women do that to me all the time.\nPenny: Yeah, okay. The thing is, I kind of told my father we got back together again.\nLeonard: What? Why?\nPenny: Well, you\xe2\x80\x99re the first guy he\xe2\x80\x99s ever really approved of, you know? You\xe2\x80\x99re a scientist who went to college and you don\xe2\x80\x99t have a neck tattoo or outstanding warrants or, or a baby.\nLeonard: What kind of guys did you used to go out with?\nPenny: Just guys. Anyway, when I told him we split up, he was heartbroken, and he kept bugging me, how\xe2\x80\x99s Leonard? why can\xe2\x80\x99t you get back together with Leonard? I bet Leonard never tipped a cow over on himself. So to get him off my back, I told him we worked things out.\nLeonard: Really? How, how\xe2\x80\x99d we manage that?\nPenny: What?\nLeonard: Well, did you apologize? Did you have to woo me?\nPenny: Get over yourself. I whistled, you came running.\nLeonard: Yeah, no, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think so.\nPenny: Okay, why are you arguing about this?\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m just saying, if we fake got back together, that\xe2\x80\x99s totally not how it fake happened.\nPenny: Oh, okay, whatever. Will you please just play along until my dad leaves?\nLeonard: Hold on, you actually want me to deceive your father with some sort of sham play acting and kissing? Cause I\xe2\x80\x99m good with that.\nPenny\xe2\x80\x99s Dad: Penny, you out here?\nPenny: Come on, honey, not in front of my dad.\nPenny\xe2\x80\x99s Dad: Relax, I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen you do a lot worse with a lot stupider.\nLeonard: See? He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mind.\nPenny\xe2\x80\x99s Dad: So, Leonard, I\xe2\x80\x99m taking your gal out for a steak dinner, you want to join us?\nPenny: Oh, dad, that\xe2\x80\x99s nice, but Leonard has to work. Right, Leonard?\nLeonard: Uh, I do, I have to work. But I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna blow that off to spend the evening with my sweetie and her father, \xe2\x80\x99cause, you know, just the kind of boyfriend I am.\nPenny: Oh.\nLeonard: Come here, you.\nScene: Raj\xe2\x80\x99s Lab.\nHoward: C-7.\nRaj: Miss.\nHoward: How could that be a miss? C-6 was a hit, C-8 was a hit. Part of your starship has to be on C-7.\nRaj: Not if it has a hole in the middle.\nHoward: What kind of spaceship has a hole in the middle?\nRaj: A Romulan battle bagel?\nBernadette: Knock-knock.\nHoward: Oh, great, you made it. Come on in. I invited her.\nBernadette: So where\xe2\x80\x99s the telescope?\nHoward: It\xe2\x80\x99s in Hawaii, but Raj controls it from here. He\xe2\x80\x99s hoping to see Epsilon Eridani dim, which would be evidence of a planet orbiting it.\nBernadette: So we just sit and stare at the screen, waiting for something to happen?\nHoward: I did it with you when we rented The Notebook. (Raj whispers) Yes, Gena Rowlands is a treasure. You\xe2\x80\x99d better open up that bottle of wine or I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna end up with swimmer\xe2\x80\x99s ear.\nRaj: Excuse me. I can\xe2\x80\x99t be drinking, I\xe2\x80\x99m about to make an important scientific discovery here.\nHoward: What? Galileo did his best work while drinking wine.\nRaj: How do you know that?\nHoward: Well, he was Italian. It\xe2\x80\x99s a reasonable assumption.\nRaj: Dude, can you even open your mouth without spewing a cultural stereotype?\nHoward: Oh, I, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, Galileo drank diet sprite. Look, you\xe2\x80\x99re my best friend, she\xe2\x80\x99s my girlfriend, you should bond. You know, like you and my mom did.\nRaj: Your mom creeps the hell out of me.\nHoward: Yes, but she\xe2\x80\x99s stopped calling you slumdog millionaire.\nRaj: I do appreciate that.\nBernadette: Here we go.\nHoward: Well I\xe2\x80\x99d like to propose a toast. To science and friendship.\nBernadette: Hold on. Wait. No, it\xe2\x80\x99s okay, go ahead.\nHoward: What?\nBernadette: Oh, I was working with Penicillin-resistant gonorrhoea in the lab today and I was just trying to remember if I washed my hands.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s dad\xe2\x80\x99s car.\nLeonard: Thanks for the steak, Wyatt.\nPenny\xe2\x80\x99s dad (Wyatt): My pleasure. It\xe2\x80\x99s nice to have dinner with a boyfriend of Penny\xe2\x80\x99s that knows how to use a napkin.\nPenny: So not funny, dad.\nWyatt: Let me tell you about this one genius she was going out with, this, this fella Donnie.\nPenny: Oh, will you please let it go?\nWyatt: Donnie was gonna make millions turning farm waste into biofuel and selling it to the government.\nLeonard: A lot of people are doing that.\nPenny: Oh, see?\nWyatt: Yeah, but all Donnie did was mix pig poop with a little water and pump it into his mom\xe2\x80\x99s Camry.\nPenny: Yeah, that\xe2\x80\x99s great. It\xe2\x80\x99s a funny story. Moving on.\nWyatt: And Donnie was a rocket scientist compared to that boy who wanted to get beer pong into the Olympics. What was his name, sweetheart?\nPenny: Curtis, and I\xe2\x80\x99m pretty sure he was joking.\nWyatt: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. That petition looked real to me.\nPenny: Yeah, okay, I think this ends the ex-boyfriend portion of our evening.\nWyatt: Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m just glad you finally found yourself a keeper.\nLeonard: Thanks, Wyatt. I\xe2\x80\x99m a keeper.\nScene: Outside Penny\xe2\x80\x99s door.\nWyatt: Leonard, you want to come in for a nightcap?\nPenny: Oh, gee, dad, he\xe2\x80\x99d love to, but Leonard has to work in the morning.\nLeonard: Maybe I could go in a little late.\nPenny: No, no, no, you can\xe2\x80\x99t. Your career is far too important.\nWyatt: Behind every great man is a nagging woman who won\xe2\x80\x99t let him have any fun, am I right, Leonard?\nLeonard: Don\xe2\x80\x99t I know it.\nWyatt: Well, good night, son.\nLeonard: Good night, Wyatt. Oh, good night, honey.\nPenny: Good night.\nLeonard: I love you.\nPenny: Love you, too.\nSheldon: Oh, friggety-frak. Not this again.\nScene: The lab.\nHoward: Three, four, five, pass go, get 2,000 Rupees, Six, seven, whoops. Can\xe2\x80\x99t go any further. There\xe2\x80\x99s a sacred cow in my way.\nRaj: Bernadette, please tell your boyfriend to cool it with the cow jokes.\nBernadette: It won\xe2\x80\x99t help. Once he finds a joke he likes, he sticks with it.\nRaj: Yeah. Like his haircut material.\nBernadette: Oh, right. Did you get your hair cut?\nRaj: No. I got them all cut.\nBernadette: Which is still so funny.\nRaj: And when you go to a Chinese restaurant, he always gets the same fortune in his fortune cookie.\nBernadette: Right. Help, I\xe2\x80\x99m a prisoner in a Chinese fortune cookie factory.\nHoward: Okay, I think that\xe2\x80\x99s enough about me.\nRaj: He\xe2\x80\x99s right. Let\xe2\x80\x99s make fun of his mother. Howard, come rub my feet! My corns are killing me!\nBernadette: Howard, help me out of the tub! I\xe2\x80\x99m stuck again!\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: Coming. Hey, lovebug.\nPenny: Shut up. You know what I\xe2\x80\x99ve been doing for the last hour?\nLeonard: Mm, dreamily doodling Mrs. Leonard Hofstadter in a notebook?\nPenny: Listening to my father go on and on about what a great guy you are.\nLeonard: You got to admit, I am, I\xe2\x80\x99m delightful.\nPenny: Why are you making this so difficult?\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s not difficult for me. I\xe2\x80\x99m having fun.\nPenny: Leonard.\nLeonard: What do you want me to do? You started this. Do you want to go over and tell him we\xe2\x80\x99re broken up?\nPenny: No.\n\xe2\x80\x93\nLeonard: Well, then, what do you want?\nPenny: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\nLeonard: Don\xe2\x80\x99t you think that\xe2\x80\x99s something you should have figured out before you stomped over here?\nPenny: Maybe.\nSheldon: Leonard, Penny, excellent. I\xe2\x80\x99d like to say I\xe2\x80\x99m very happy that you\xe2\x80\x99re back together, and if I can figure out a way to do so and sound sincere, I will. In the meantime, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to go over some proposed changes to the roommate agreement specifically to address Penny\xe2\x80\x99s annoying personal habits.\nPenny: Oh, my God. What personal habits?\nLeonard: I have a list. FYI, overuse of the phrase, oh, my god, is number 12.\nPenny: Okay, Sheldon, you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to do this because Leonard and I are not\xe2\x80\xa6\nLeonard: Ba-ba-ba-ba. Are you sure you want to include him in this?\nSheldon: Include me in what? Is there a plot afoot? I\xe2\x80\x99ll have no truck with plots.\nPenny: No, you\xe2\x80\x99re right. No, there\xe2\x80\x99s, there\xe2\x80\x99s no plots, no trucks, no feet. So what other annoying habits shall we discuss?\nSheldon: Uh, we don\xe2\x80\x99t discuss anything. Leonard is the signatory to the Roommate Agreement. As such, he bears responsibility for all your infractions and must pay all fines.\nLeonard: Fines?\nSheldon: Yes. If Penny\xe2\x80\x99s going to be spending nights here again, you\xe2\x80\x99ll need to set up an escrow account. Sign here.\nScene: The lab.\nRaj: Hello, Hawaii. This is Dr. Koothrappali in Pasadena. I\xe2\x80\x99d like you to reposition the telescope, please. Scarlett Johansson\xe2\x80\x99s house! I\xe2\x80\x99m kidding, Hawaii. Mahalo. Whoo!\nHoward: It might have been a mistake to open that second bottle of wine.\nBernadette: Well, live and learn. So, Raj, do you think this planet you\xe2\x80\x99re looking for could have an atmosphere that supports life?\nRaj: Maybe. If it did, I\xe2\x80\x99d be famous. I\xe2\x80\x99d be on the cover of magazines. And then, instead of living alone in my tiny apartment, I\xe2\x80\x99d have a big mansion.\nBernadette: That sounds great.\nRaj: It is. If you like wandering around a big, empty house with no one to love you.\nHoward: We\xe2\x80\x99d come visit you.\nRaj: No, you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t. You\xe2\x80\x99d be intimidated by my wealth and fame. My only friends would be my genetically engineered monkey butler, and the little people I hired to be my living chess set.\nBernadette: He\xe2\x80\x99s taking a turn to the dark side, isn\xe2\x80\x99t he?\nHoward: Hold on. He could come back.\nRaj: Oh, what\xe2\x80\x99s the point of everything?\nHoward: Nope. He\xe2\x80\x99s gone.\nRaj: You know it\xe2\x80\x99s been more than a year since I\xe2\x80\x99ve even kissed a girl?\nHoward: What about that hook-up at Comic-Con you told me about?\nRaj: Oh, grow up. I was lying. I lie all the time. Nobody wants to kiss me.\nBernadette: Oh, you poor, poor thing. Raj, you have to know you\xe2\x80\x99re a wonderful man. There are a lot of girls out there who\xe2\x80\x99ll want to kiss you.\nRaj: Where?\nBernadette: You just have to look.\nHoward: No!\nBernadette: Well, this was fun.\nScene: The apartment. Wyatt and Leonard are playing Wii fishing.\nWyatt: Oh! I think I got a nibble.\nLeonard: Oh, b-be careful. Give him some line. Okay, now reel him in.\nWyatt: Oh, look at that baby. They\xe2\x80\x99re really biting, huh?\nLeonard: Yeah. They do that when you set it on easy.\nWyatt (phone rings): Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s me. Hello. Oh, hi, sweetie. Yeah, I got up early and didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to wake you, so I went out for coffee and ran into Leonard on the way back. Guess what, we\xe2\x80\x99re fishing. Yeah. Right here on his couch.\nLeonard: Hey, baby. I love you! Mwuh, mwuh, mwuh, mwuh, mwuh.\nWyatt: That\xe2\x80\x99s Leonard says he loves you. What? I see. The whole thing\xe2\x80\x99s bull squirt, huh? Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s very disappointing. Bye.\nLeonard: Oh, hey. There\xe2\x80\x99s been something I\xe2\x80\x99ve been meaning to tell you.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nWyatt: I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe you would lie to me like that.\nLeonard: Just for the record, I did not want to be a part of this.\nWyatt: I\xe2\x80\x99ll get to you in a minute.\nLeonard: No hurry.\nWyatt: That my own daughter thinks I don\xe2\x80\x99t love her enough to support her no matter what choices she makes, well, that hurts me deeply.\nPenny: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, daddy\xe2\x80\xa6\nWyatt: Let me finish.\nPenny: Oh.\nWyatt: I thought we were past the days when you would try to pull the wool over my eyes. Telling me the baggie in your underwear drawer is potpourri? And the pee stick in your bathroom is to check for diabetes?\nPenny: You know, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.\nWyatt: You\xe2\x80\x99re a grown woman, and I respect your right to make your own decisions, but all I ask is you respect me enough to be honest about them.\nPenny: You\xe2\x80\x99re right. Look, from now on, I will tell you the truth.\nWyatt: Thank you. Now, why don\xe2\x80\x99t you go and put some clothes on and we\xe2\x80\x99ll grab a bite to eat before I head for the airport. Now you.\nPenny: Daddy, he had nothing to do\xe2\x80\xa6\nWyatt: Keep walking.\nPenny: Okay.\nWyatt: Please, please, please don\xe2\x80\x99t give up on her.\nLeonard: What?\nWyatt: I can\xe2\x80\x99t go back to the skateboard idiots, the white rappers and all those sweaty dumb-asses with their backwards hats.\nLeonard: Gee, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if it\xe2\x80\x99s in the cards, sir.\nWyatt: Then, stack the deck. Cheat. Lie. I don\xe2\x80\x99t care. I want grandkids before I die, and I want them to grow up in a house without wheels.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99ll give it a shot.\nWyatt: Thank you. Now I\xe2\x80\x99m going to do something here to help you along.\nLeonard: Excuse me?\nWyatt: Just don\xe2\x80\x99t panic. Now, get your sorry, lying ass out of my face and make sure I never see it again!\nLeonard: Oh, the reverse psychology thing. I see. That\xe2\x80\x99s very clever.\nWyatt: Don\xe2\x80\x99t yap. Just get out.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99ll friend you on Facebook.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Oh, there you are. Just so you know, I was up all night, but I have finally completed the Penny-specific section of the new roommate agreement.\nLeonard: Yeah, well, not necessary. We broke up again.\nSheldon: Do you even think about other people, Leonard? Do you?\nScene: The cafeteria.\nRaj: Hey.\nLeonard: Oh, how\xe2\x80\x99d it go last night?\nRaj: Oh, you know. Same old, same old. Looked through a telescope, saw some stars. Big whoop.\nLeonard: Really? You waited months for time with that telescope. What happened?\nRaj: Why? You writing a book?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m going to propose a hypothesis. Last night, Raj accidentally made contact with an alien civilization and has been ordered by the United States government to keep it a secret.\nRaj: Nothing happened. Can we please just change the subject?\nSheldon: That sounds rehearsed. We are not alone.\nHoward: Hey.\nLeonard: Hey.\nSheldon: Hello.\nHoward: Hey.\nRaj: Hey.\nLeonard: You get to play with Raj\xe2\x80\x99s big telescope last night?\nHoward: Whoa. Where did that come from?\nRaj: He never touched my telescope.\nHoward: Way to go shutting up.\nRaj: I did shut up. Now you shut up.\nHoward: Fine.\nRaj: Thank you. How come you didn\xe2\x80\x99t call me this morning?\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
