b'Scene: The apartment.\nRaj: Water Demon.\nHoward: Ice Dragon.\nLeonard: Lesser Warlord of Ka\xe2\x80\x99a.\nSheldon: Not so fast. Infinite Sheldon.\nLeonard: Infinite Sheldon?\nSheldon: Yes, Infinite Sheldon defeats all other cards and does not violate the rule against homemade cards because I made it at work.\nLeonard: Do you understand why people don\xe2\x80\x99t want to play with you?\nSheldon: No, although it\xe2\x80\x99s a question I\xe2\x80\x99ve been pondering since preschool.\nLeonard: Hey.\nZack: Hey.\nLeonard: Hey.\nPenny: Hey, your copy of Science magazine was in my mailbox.\nLeonard: Oh, thanks.\nPenny: Mm-hmm.\nZack: Check it out, all about planets this month.\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99s an atom.\nZack: Agree to disagree. That\xe2\x80\x99s what I love about science, there\xe2\x80\x99s no one right answer.\nLeonard: So, you and Zack again, huh?\nPenny: Yeah, yeah, me and Zack again.\nZack: Were we here earlier?\nPenny: Okay, we should, we should go.\nZack: Ah, not yet. I want to talk science with the science dudes.\nHoward: Oh, and the science dudes want to talk science with you. What do you want to talk about, rocks, dinosaurs, our friend the beaver?\nZack: You know, I saw this great thing on the Discovery Channel. Turns out that if you kill a starfish, it\xe2\x80\x99ll just come back to life.\nSheldon: Was the starfish wearing boxer shorts? Because you might have been watching Nickelodeon.\nZack: No, I\xe2\x80\x99m almost sure that it was the Discovery Channel. It was a great show. They also said dolphins might be smarter than people.\nLeonard: They might be smarter than some people.\nZack: Well, maybe we can do an experiment to find out.\nSheldon: Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s easy enough. We\xe2\x80\x99d need a large tank of water, a hoop to jump through, and a bucket of whatever bite-sized treats you find tasty.\nZack: I don\xe2\x80\x99t get it.\nLeonard: A dolphin might.\nZack: Oh, I see. You guys are inferring that I\xe2\x80\x99m stupid.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s not correct. We were implying it. You then inferred it.\nZack: Let\xe2\x80\x99s go.\nPenny: You know, for a group of guys who claim they spent most of their lives being bullied, you can be real jerks. Shame on all of you. (Closes door)\nRaj: What the hell did I do?\nPenny (Opens door again): You laughed.\nScene: The same.\n  Leonard: You think Penny\xe2\x80\x99s right? Were we bullying Zack?\nHoward: No, I know bullying. He left here unswirlied and his ass crack was underpants-free.\nRaj: And nobody drew a penis on his forehead.\nLeonard: That happened to you?\nRaj: First day of cricket camp. They drew it so the testicles were my eyes.\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, I think we might owe the guy an apology.\nHoward: So go apologize.\nLeonard: Why me?\nHoward: You started it, we just piled on.\nLeonard: What would I even say?\nSheldon: Zack, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry you\xe2\x80\x99re stupid. Have a Milk Dud.\nRaj: A Milk Dud?\nSheldon: Yeah, Milk Duds, with their self-deprecating name and remarkably mild flavour, are the most apologetic of the boxed candies.\nLeonard: I got a better idea. We\xe2\x80\x99re all responsible. I say we all go. Come on, who\xe2\x80\x99s with me? Free comic books to anyone who comes with me. I might get punched. You really want to miss that?\nRaj: Junior Mints are pretty apologetic.\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re embarrassing yourself.\nScene: At Penny\xe2\x80\x99s door. Leonard knocks three times.\nSheldon: Penny.\nPenny: What?\nLeonard: Yeah, we came to talk to Zack. Hey, Zack.\nZack: What do you want?\nLeonard: Listen, uh, the stuff we were saying before, we were just kidding around.\nZack: No, you weren\xe2\x80\x99t. You were making fun of me.\nLeonard: Come on, that\xe2\x80\x99s what we do. We give each other a hard time. Hey, Sheldon, you look like a praying mantis.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s very hurtful.\nLeonard: See?\nZack: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, it still wasn\xe2\x80\x99t very nice.\nSheldon: Milk Dud?\nZack: Oh, I love Milk Duds. Okay, we\xe2\x80\x99re cool.\nSheldon (to Raj): Junior Mints.\nZack: You guys want to come in and have a beer?\nLeonard: Uh, we\xe2\x80\x99re on our way to the comic book store.\nHoward: Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s buying.\nZack: Really? I haven\xe2\x80\x99t been to a comic book store in literally a million years.\nSheldon: Literally? Literally a million years?\nLeonard: Don\xe2\x80\x99t.\nZack: You want to go with \xe2\x80\x99em?\nPenny: No.\nZack: Okay, see you later.\nPenny: Wait, w-w-wait-wait-wait, you\xe2\x80\x99re ditching me to go look at comic books?\nZack: Are you mad at me?\nPenny: I\xe2\x80\x99m not happy.\nZack: Milk Dud?\nScene: The comic book store.\nZack: Wow, this place is awesome. Where do they keep the Archies?\nSheldon: In the bedrooms of ten-year-old girls, where they belong.\nZack: Oh, no, you\xe2\x80\x99re thinking old-school Archie. It\xe2\x80\x99s much more sophisticated now. Like, there\xe2\x80\x99s two universes, and Archie\xe2\x80\x99s married to Betty in one and Veronica in the other. Midge is even breaking up with Moose.\nRaj: No.\nZack: About time, right?\nStuart: Hey.\nZack: Hey.\nStuart: You guys finally chip in for a bodyguard?\nLeonard: Uh, no. Oh, this is Zack. He\xe2\x80\x99s a friend of ours. Zack, this is Stuart. He owns the store.\nZack: Wow, lucky you.\nStuart: Yeah, I work 70 hours a week and average a dollar sixty five an hour.\nZack: Sweet.\nStuart: Is that sarcasm?\nHoward: Uh, no, it\xe2\x80\x99s an indictment of the American education system.\nRaj: The Archies are over here.\nZack: Yippee.\nStuart: So are you guys coming to my New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Eve costume party?\nSheldon: Of course. We\xe2\x80\x99re coming as the Justice League of America.\nHoward: Switching it up from last year when we came as the Justice League of America.\nSheldon: To that point, it occurs to me that we might have an opportunity to finally snare Best Group Costume if we shore up our weak link, which is clearly Leonard as Superman.\nLeonard: Hey, I got new boots this year. Guaranteed to add three inches.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s sad. Let\xe2\x80\x99s ask ourselves, is there anyone we know who would make a more manly and convincing son of Krypton?\nStuart: Than than Leonard in high-heeled boots? Howard\xe2\x80\x99s mother in high-heeled boots?\nSheldon: I was thinking specifically of the gentleman over there moving his lips as he enjoys the latest exploits of Betty and Veronica.\nLeonard: Zack?\nHoward: He is the only person we know with actual muscles.\nLeonard: You can\xe2\x80\x99t replace me with Zack.\nSheldon: Why not? Penny did it.\nHoward: Yeah, she seems happier. Why wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t we be?\nZack: Score. I got an Archie, Betty and Veronica, and a Jughead. All set for my weekend number twos.\nSheldon: Congratulations. Zack, how would you like to be Superman?\nZack: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, sounds like a lot of responsibility.\nScene: The stairwell.\n  Leonard: Fine, if Zack\xe2\x80\x99s going to be Superman, I want to be Green Lantern.\nRaj: But I\xe2\x80\x99m Green Lantern.\nLeonard: You can be Aquaman.\nRaj: I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be Aquaman. He sucks. He sucks underwater. He sucks fish pee.\nSheldon: Excuse me, I believe Aquaman uses his telepathic powers to request the fish do their business elsewhere.\nZack: Hey, babe.\nPenny: I\xe2\x80\x99m still mad at you.\nZack: Well, you won\xe2\x80\x99t be when you hear the great news.\nPenny: What great news?\nZack: We\xe2\x80\x99re going to a costume party at the comic book store on New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Eve, and you get to be Wonder Woman.\nSheldon: Complete with bulletproof bracelets and lasso of truth. Invisible plane sold separately.\nPenny: Wait, why me? Wh-Why can\xe2\x80\x99t your girlfriend be Wonder Woman?\nHoward: She and her lab team are under quarantine. Seems at the Christmas party they were doing Jell-O shots out of petri dishes that used to contain yellow fever.\nPenny: Okay, what about your friend Amy?\nSheldon: Amy Farrah Fowler doesn\xe2\x80\x99t believe in wearing costumes. She isn\xe2\x80\x99t the free spirit I am.\nPenny: Okay, well, forget it. I\xe2\x80\x99m not spending my New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Eve at a comic book store wearing a Wonder Woman costume.\nHoward (after Raj whispers to him): He says he\xe2\x80\x99ll wear it if you\xe2\x80\x99ll be Aquaman.\nScene: The apartment. Leonard is dressed as Green Lantern, Sheldon as The Flash.\nLeonard: What are you doing?\nSheldon: We\xe2\x80\x99re going to be late. I\xe2\x80\x99m pacing nervously.\nLeonard: You\xe2\x80\x99re jogging.\nSheldon: This is how the Flash paces.\nLeonard; Just chill out, Sheldon.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m not Sheldon. I\xe2\x80\x99m the Flash. And now I\xe2\x80\x99m going to the Grand Canyon to scream in frustration. I\xe2\x80\x99m back.\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m Batman.\nSheldon: Oh, I hardly think so. The real caped crusader calls his crime-fighting cohorts when he\xe2\x80\x99s running late.\nHoward: I had to walk. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get Raj on the back of my scooter.\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99ve said this before, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll say it again. Aquaman sucks.\nZack: Look up in the sky. It\xe2\x80\x99s a bird. It\xe2\x80\x99s a plane. I forget the rest.\nPenny: All right. Let\xe2\x80\x99s get this thing over with.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. But in what universe is Wonder Woman blonde?\nHoward: Relax. No one\xe2\x80\x99s going to be looking at her hair. Ow! I mean, ow.\nZack: Hold on. The costume came with a black wig. Where is it, babe?\nPenny: No. I\xe2\x80\x99m not wearing it. It looks stupid.\nZack: Come on. We\xe2\x80\x99re trying to win a contest here.\nPenny: Forget it. I\xe2\x80\x99m not wearing the wig.\nZack: Penny, there\xe2\x80\x99s no I in Justice League.\nHoward: Well, actually.\nSheldon: Don\xe2\x80\x99t. He\xe2\x80\x99s making our case.\nZack: Okay, babe. Uh, kind of embarrassing me in front of my friends.\nPenny: Okay. You know what? I changed my mind. I\xe2\x80\x99m not going.\nRaj: Looks like someone else is going to have to be Wonder Woman.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s door.\nZack: Babe, open up.\nPenny: I\xe2\x80\x99m not talking to you.\nZack: Then who are you talking to? Babe?\nSheldon:  (Knock) Penny, (Knock) Penny, (Knock) Penny, (Knock) Penny, (Knock) Penny, (Knock) Penny, (Knock) Penny, (Knock) Penny, (Knock) Penny, (Knock) Penny, (Knock) Penny, (Knock) Penny, (Knock) Penny, (Knock) Penny, (Knock) Penny, (Knock) Penny, (Knock) Penny, (Knock) Penny, (Knock) Penny, (Knock) Penny.\nPenny: What the hell is wrong with you?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m the Flash. I just knocked 30,000 times.\nPenny: Okay. What do you want, Sheldon?\nSheldon: I understand why you\xe2\x80\x99re upset.\nPenny: Really?\nSheldon: Yes. You\xe2\x80\x99re afraid that costume makes you look fat.\nPenny: No. Wait, wait, does it?\nSheldon: Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry. Wonder Woman was an Amazon. And Amazons tend to be very beefy gals.\nPenny: Good-bye, Sheldon.\nSheldon: But they\xe2\x80\x99re not blonde, so put on your wig. Hello?\nScene: The apartment.\nRaj: Stupid Aquaman.\nLeonard: If it makes you feel any better, when I was dating Penny, she used to flip out on me all the time.\nZack: Whoa. You dated Penny?\nLeonard: She didn\xe2\x80\x99t tell you?\nZack: She told me she dated a guy named Leonard. Who would have thought it was you?\nLeonard: Who else would it be?\nZack: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Somebody bigger and, yeah, sure. Why not you?\nSheldon: I may have failed.\nHoward: Okay, I guess we just go without a Wonder Woman.\nZack: I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to go without Penny.\nRaj: Oh, great. No Superman, no Wonder Woman? All we\xe2\x80\x99ve got is a skinny Flash, an Indian Aquaman, a nearsighted Green Lantern, and a teeny, tiny Dark Knight.\nSheldon: Obviously, we\xe2\x80\x99re no longer a Justice League. We have no choice but to switch to our Muppet Baby costumes.\nRaj: Ooh, I call Kermit.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m Kermit. You\xe2\x80\x99re Scooter.\nRaj: Oh, man. Scooter sucks. He\xe2\x80\x99s the Aquaman of the Muppet Babies.\nHoward: No, we can still make this work. Leonard, you talk to Penny.\nLeonard: What makes you think I can convince her?\nHoward: You got her to have sex with you. Obviously, your superpower is brainwashing.\nLeonard: Okay, let me see if I understand this. You want me to convince my ex-girlfriend to go to a costume party with her new boyfriend just so we can win a stupid prize?\nSheldon: Yes. And make her wear the black wig. Good luck.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment. Knocking.\nPenny: Go away, Sheldon.\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s Leonard.\nPenny: Oh. Go away, Leonard.\nLeonard; Come on, let me just talk to you.\nPenny: It\xe2\x80\x99s open.\nLeonard: Hey.\nPenny: I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to that party, Leonard.\nLeonard: Okay, listen. You don\xe2\x80\x99t have to wear the wig. At this party, we\xe2\x80\x99re gonna win first prize just by showing up with a girl.\nPenny: It\xe2\x80\x99s not the wig.\nLeonard: Did I do something? I mean, I tried to be friends with Zack, like you said, which believe me, was difficult, given how you and me used to be, you know, you and me, and now you and him are you and him.\nPenny: Okay, look. We\xe2\x80\x99re not really me and him.\nLeonard: Then what are you?\nPenny: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I only started seeing Zack again so I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be alone on New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Eve. How pathetic is that?\nLeonard: Not as pathetic as dressing up like this and going to a comic book store on New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Eve.\nPenny: You make a cute Green Arrow.\nLeonard: Green Lantern.\nPenny: Like there\xe2\x80\x99s a difference.\nLeonard: There\xe2\x80\x99s a big difference. Arrow. Lantern.\nPenny: Whatever. Look, if Zack and I had just gone to a regular club or a party, it would have been fine, but this, with the costumes, and you.\nLeonard: What about me?\nPenny: Nothing. Let\xe2\x80\x99s go to the party. (Puts on wig) How do I look?\nLeonard: Um, I guarantee you\xe2\x80\x99ll be the prettiest girl there.\nHoward (outside the door): Okay, the good news is, we have a Wonder Woman.\nSheldon: Oh.\nZack: Yes.\nSheldon: What\xe2\x80\x99s the bad news?\nHoward: Superman probably isn\xe2\x80\x99t getting laid tonight.\nZack: Aw, damn.\nScene: The party.\n  Stuart: And the award for best group costume goes to Justice League of America number three!\nSheldon: Thank you! Thank you so much!\nStuart: Okay. Okay, ten seconds to midnight.\nAll: Ten, nine, eight\xe2\x80\xa6\nSheldon: No, wait! I have a speech.\nAll: Seven, six\xe2\x80\xa6\nSheldon: Stop counting!\nAll: Five, four, three\xe2\x80\xa6\nSheldon: This is my moment, dag nab it!\nAll: Two, one! Happy New Year!\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to say another word until you people settle down. I\xe2\x80\x99m waiting.\nScene: The street.\nZack: That was a great party. We should dress like this all the time.\nPenny: Are you high?\nLeonard: You\xe2\x80\x99re being a bully.\nHoward: Check it out. Those guys are breaking into that car.\nLeonard: What should we do?\nSheldon: We\xe2\x80\x99re the Justice League of America. There\xe2\x80\x99s only one thing we can do. Turn around and slowly walk away.\nZack (after a moment\xe2\x80\x99s thought): Nah. Hold up.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: Look, I know our winter thermostat setting is 72 degrees, but I\xe2\x80\x99m a little warm, so I\xe2\x80\x99m going to turn it down.\nSheldon (as The Flash, runs to the Grand Canyon): Good Lord, how you frustrate me, Leonard Hofstadter! (Runs back) Fine.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
