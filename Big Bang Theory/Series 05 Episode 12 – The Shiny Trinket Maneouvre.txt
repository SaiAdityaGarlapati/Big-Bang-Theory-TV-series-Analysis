b'Scene: The apartment.\nHoward: Completely empty box. If you\xe2\x80\x99d like to examine it?\nLeonard: Mm-hmm. Yep. I see nothing in this box but a wasted childhood.\nHoward: Little snarky there, cello lessons. And we have this completely ordinary cylinder. If you\xe2\x80\x99d like to examine it?\nRaj: Ordinary, yet I sense it is dripping with magical potential.\nSheldon: Oh, dear Lord. A man pops out for a moment to evacuate his bowels and catch up on the adventures of the Caped Crusader, only to emerge and discover his apartment has been transformed into a cabaret.\nLeonard: Sheldon, he\xe2\x80\x99s just practising for his cousin\xe2\x80\x99s birthday party.\nHoward: As I was saying, empty box, empty cylinder, and, ooh, voila. (Pulls out a goldfish in a jar)\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99m telling you, dude, there\xe2\x80\x99s a seat on the Hogwarts Express with your name on it.\nSheldon: This is how you\xe2\x80\x99re going to entertain your little cousin and his friends? By lying to them?\nHoward: How is this lying?\nSheldon: A magic show is an inherently deceitful proposition. This is an ordinary top hat. You\xe2\x80\x99ve chosen that card freely. I do not have a set of lock picks lodged in my keister.\nRaj: Can\xe2\x80\x99t you just enjoy the wonder, Sheldon? Why must you peek behind the curtain? Or up the butt?\nSheldon: If we poison the critical thinking faculties of children by telling them that rabbits come out of hats, then we create adults who believe in astrology and homeopathy and that Ryan Reynolds was a better choice for Green Lantern than lovable rogue Nathan Fillion.\nLeonard: Sheldon, he\xe2\x80\x99s just gonna do a few magic tricks for some kids. I really don\xe2\x80\x99t think they\xe2\x80\x99re gonna end up liking the Green Lantern movie.\nHoward: Don\xe2\x80\x99t be so hard on him. It\xe2\x80\x99s natural to be a little cranky when you have a quarter in your ear!\nSheldon: Coins lodged in body parts is not a source of amusement. When I was five, Billy Sparks put a Mexican peso up my nose.\nHoward: How is that not amusing?\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s still there. Takes me 45 minutes to get through airport security. (Storms out)\nHoward: Look, I made Sheldon disappear. Ta-da.\nLeonard: Next time, you should open with that.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The Cheesecake Factory.\nPenny: Ooh, look who\xe2\x80\x99s out on a date. Pasadena\xe2\x80\x99s favourite power couple, Shamy.\nSheldon: And that is the answer to the question, what is wrong with eating at The Cheesecake Factory?\nPenny: So, are we celebrating anything special tonight?\nAmy: Oh, yes. Our relationship agreement specifies that the second Thursday of every month, or the third Thursday in a month with five Thursdays, is date night.\nPenny: That is so hot.\nSheldon: All right, without objection, the minutes of the previous date are considered read and agreed to. Any new business?\nAmy: How was your day?\nSheldon: Superb. This morning I made a palindrome with my Alpha-Bits. Nice hat, Bob Tahecin.\nAmy: Sounds like you hit the ground running. I have a bit of good news myself. My most recent paper on how a cooperative long-term potentiation can map memory sequences in dendritic branches made the cover of Neuron.\nSheldon: Ooh! Speaking of good news, somebody just hit 100 Twitter followers.\nAmy: That\xe2\x80\x99s nice. Anyway, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been dreaming of this day for a long time.\nSheldon: Yeah, me, too. Triple digits, I\xe2\x80\x99m not gonna lie, feels pretty good.\nAmy: Sheldon, I\xe2\x80\x99m the sole author on a paper being published in a distinguished journal that may change the course of my field.\nSheldon: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Ooh, 101! Air\xe2\x80\x99s getting a bit thin up here.\nPenny: So, are we ready to order?\nAmy: Give me a minute. I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna go wash up.\nSheldon: Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s odd. We both washed up when we came in. It\xe2\x80\x99s probably a euphemism for urination.\nPenny: Sheldon, what is wrong with you?\nSheldon: Not much. Although, I can be faulted for being overly fond of koala bears. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what it is, when they smart munching on eucalyptus, I just melt inside.\nPenny: Okay, Amy just told you some exciting news, and you acted like it was no big deal.\nSheldon: Oh, I see why you\xe2\x80\x99re confused. No, her news sounded important, but what you\xe2\x80\x99re forgetting is, it was an achievement in the field of biology. That\xe2\x80\x99s all about yucky, squishy things.\nPenny: Honey, she\xe2\x80\x99s upset. You\xe2\x80\x99re her boyfriend. You have to at least try to be excited by the things she\xe2\x80\x99s excited by.\nSheldon: What if they simply don\xe2\x80\x99t excite me?\nPenny: Well, just smile and think about koalas.\nSheldon: She\xe2\x80\x99d see right through that. We go to the zoo all the time. She knows my koala face. And for future reference, it\xe2\x80\x99s this.\nScene: Howard\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom.\nBernadette: Oh, you have a lot of magic stuff.\nHoward: Yeah. I started when I was a teenager. I thought I could show a girl a few tricks and invite her up to my bedroom to see the rest of the act.\nBernadette: Did it work?\nHoward: Ah, let\xe2\x80\x99s just say the only wand that ever saw any action was this one. Oh, look what my mom made us for the act.\nBernadette: Ooh. I like the fabric. Where\xe2\x80\x99d she get it?\nHoward: Well, she cut up one of her old bathing suits. She made these two vests and half a dozen napkins.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Has she tried on the vest yet?\nHoward: I just gave it to her!\nMrs Wolowitz (off): I hope it fits, she has a tricky figure! She\xe2\x80\x99s short and stacked, like me!\nHoward: She\xe2\x80\x99s not stacked like you, Ma! She never steps on hers!\nBernadette: Listen, Howie, maybe I\xe2\x80\x99m not the best choice to be a magician\xe2\x80\x99s assistant.\nHoward: You\xe2\x80\x99ll do fine. Hand me those rings? See? You nailed it.\nBernadette: You know, i-it\xe2\x80\x99s just that I\xe2\x80\x99m not that comfortable with little kids.\nHoward: Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s because you haven\xe2\x80\x99t been around them much. This is good practice. I mean, you are gonna be a mom someday, right?\nBernadette: Mmm, yeah, sure.\nHoward: Oh-ho-ho! I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen this trick in years. It\xe2\x80\x99s called the dove pan. You let everyone see the pan is empty, but there\xe2\x80\x99s a secret compartment in the lid. And then you open it and produce a live\xe2\x80\xa6 Don\xe2\x80\x99t look in there.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: Oh, a little Red Dead Redemption, huh?\nSheldon: Yes.\nLeonard: How come you\xe2\x80\x99re not doing a mission? You\xe2\x80\x99re just wandering around.\nSheldon: Had a rough night. I thought I\xe2\x80\x99d go for a walk and clear my head.\nLeonard: Some people go outside and do that.\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s after nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock, at this hour the streets of Pasadena are teeming with drunken sailors and alley cats.\nLeonard: You want to talk about it?\nSheldon: No. I think I\xe2\x80\x99ll just go in this saloon and drink my troubles away.\nLeonard: You know digital alcohol is never a solution. What\xe2\x80\x99s going on?\nSheldon: Hard as this may be to believe, it\xe2\x80\x99s possible that I\xe2\x80\x99m not boyfriend material.\nLeonard: Glad I was sitting down for that. Did you and Amy get in a fight?\nSheldon: Amy had a fight. I was being perfectly reasonable. I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna have a whiskey. Do you want anything?\nLeonard: No, I can\xe2\x80\x99t. I\xe2\x80\x99m playing Grand Theft Auto later. Look, I\xe2\x80\x99m no expert in women.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99ll say.\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99s not necessary when someone\xe2\x80\x99s trying to help you.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. It\xe2\x80\x99s the alcohol talking. Go on.\nLeonard: Sometimes with women you want to listen to what upsets them and then show them that you can grow and change.\nSheldon: Nuts to that. What else you got?\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to tell you. Buy her something.\nSheldon: How does that work?\nLeonard: Well, you skip over any attempt to repair your emotional connection and you win back her affection with an empty financial gesture.\nSheldon: Well, that approach has Sheldon Cooper written all over it.\nLeonard: Glad I could help.\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s appreciated. And if you ever manage to find a woman again, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be glad to return the favour.\nScene: The birthday party.\nHoward: And now, all the rings are magically linked together. My fiancee\xe2\x80\x99s wearing a magic ring, too. It made all my money disappear.\nBernadette: Oh, ah, right. (Bangs drum and cymbal) And now, the great Howdini\xe2\x80\x99s next miraculous illusion.\nChild: When are we gonna have cake?\nBernadette: After you\xe2\x80\x99ve been thoroughly amazed.\nChild: But we want cake now.\nBernadette: Well, you\xe2\x80\x99re not getting cake right now, capisce?\nHoward: Okay. Okay. Now, my lovely assistant is going to bring me an ordinary pitcher of milk.\nSecond child: I know how you do that trick.\nBernadette: Do you know how to pipe down?\nHoward: Okay, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to roll up this newspaper.\nSecond child: It\xe2\x80\x99s a fake pitcher.\nBernadette: You got wax in your ears? The man said it\xe2\x80\x99s an ordinary pitcher. Howdini.\nHoward: Okay, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to stick this in here (puts newspaper into trouser waistband) and then I\xe2\x80\x99m going to pour in the milk. I hope this works, because I didn\xe2\x80\x99t bring a change of pants.\nSecond child: Look, I Googled it. It\xe2\x80\x99s a fake pitcher.\nBernadette: That\xe2\x80\x99s it. No cake for you. Anyone else want to join the No Cake Club?\nHoward: She\xe2\x80\x99s just kidding, boys and girls. Everyone gets cake.\nBernadette: Not him.\nHoward: Just give me the pitcher. Behold! Wrong pitcher.\nScene: Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s car.\nBernadette: I told you I\xe2\x80\x99m not good with kids.\nHoward: Yes, you did. Oh, I think my crotch is starting to curdle.\nBernadette: The thing is, my mother worked full-time. I had to take care of my brothers and sisters.\nHoward: Yeah, so?\nBernadette: Ugh, it was horrible. With their snotty noses and their poopy diapers and their little shrieky voices, always complaining. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get dressed. Joey keeps spitting in my mouth. This isn\xe2\x80\x99t the way Mom makes waffles. Well, okay, put your hand in here. Let\xe2\x80\x99s see how you like this waffle!\nHoward: All right, settle down. Red light. Red light, red light! Okay, we\xe2\x80\x99re fine.\nBernadette: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. I know it makes me sound like a bad person, but I just don\xe2\x80\x99t like children.\nHoward: Yeah, no, we all got that. But don\xe2\x80\x99t you think it\xe2\x80\x99ll be different when the child is ours?\nBernadette: Right, when it\xe2\x80\x99s our kid that\xe2\x80\x99s ruined my body and kept me up all night and I\xe2\x80\x99ve got no career and no future and nothing to be happy about for the next 20 years, sure, that\xe2\x80\x99ll be completely different.\nHoward: Well, yeah.\nScene: A jewellery store.\nSheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\xe2\x80\x99s anything in this jewellery store that Amy would appreciate more than the humidifier we were just looking at at Sears.\nPenny: Oh, my God, now I know what I sound like to you when I say stupid stuff.\nSheldon: Ooh, a pocket watch.\nPenny: Okay, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think Amy wants a pocket watch.\nSheldon: No, but maybe she wants a man with a pocket watch.\nPenny: Still saying stupid stuff. Ooh, does she like bracelets?\nSheldon: Well, she\xe2\x80\x99s very fond of her silver one that says allergic to penicillin. Maybe they have a dressier version of that?\nAssistant: Well, how are we doing this afternoon? Are we looking for anything special? Perhaps a ring for the lady?\nPenny: (Snorts) Trust me, we are not a couple.\nSheldon: Excuse me. I don\xe2\x80\x99t see why you get to snort derisively and point that out. You\xe2\x80\x99d be lucky to land a fella like me.\nPenny: Fine, go ahead.\nSheldon: (Snorts) Trust me, we are not a couple.\nAssistant: My apologies. How can I help you today?\nPenny: He\xe2\x80\x99s in trouble with his girlfriend and needs to buy her a present.\nAssistant: Great, trouble with girlfriends is what\xe2\x80\x99s putting my daughter through USC.\nPenny: Ooh, are these real diamonds?\nAssistant: Yes. Channel set baguettes, 20 points total weight.\nSheldon: Remarkable. Diamonds, crystallized carbon. Every day, people go to the grocery store and come home with sacks full of carbon in the form of charcoal briquettes that they toss in their barbeques and set on fire. But just because you\xe2\x80\x99ve got some carbon with the atoms stacked neatly, you expect me to plunk down thousands of dollars.\nAssistant: Actually, that\xe2\x80\x99s only 750. Everything\xe2\x80\x99s on sale.\nSheldon: Really. Talk to me about that pocket watch.\nScene: The apartment. The guys are playing Donkey Kong Jenga.\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m still trying to wrap my mind around it. I always thought I\xe2\x80\x99d be a dad someday.\nRaj: Oh, me, too. You\xe2\x80\x99re so caring. I\xe2\x80\x99ve often pictured you guiding a young boy into manhood.\nLeonard: There you go, Howard. Sounds like Raj\xe2\x80\x99ll have your babies, problem solved.\nRaj: Hey, just because a man shows caring for another man doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean he\xe2\x80\x99s displaying the love that dare not speak its name. Did she definitely say she didn\xe2\x80\x99t want kids?\nHoward: Yeah, she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like them. And from what I saw, the feeling was mutual.\nLeonard: What are you gonna do?\nHoward: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I can\xe2\x80\x99t see a life where I don\xe2\x80\x99t have kids. I mean, people have kids. I mean, even Donkey Kong had Donkey Kong Jr. So he could teach someone how to kidnap princesses and throw barrels at Italian plumbers.\nLeonard: You know, there\xe2\x80\x99s no guarantee even if you have kids that you\xe2\x80\x99re going to like them.\nRaj: Wow, that\xe2\x80\x99s rough. Where\xe2\x80\x99d you get that?\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s right off the dust jacket of my mom\xe2\x80\x99s last book.\nHoward: Maybe me and Bernadette aren\xe2\x80\x99t right for each other.\nLeonard: Look, Howard, I\xe2\x80\x99d say there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of fish in the sea, but I watched you dangle your hook in the water for years. Do not throw her back.\nHoward: I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to, but this is kind of a deal breaker.\nRaj: What\xe2\x80\x99s your mom going to say if you call off the wedding?\nHoward: Huh, it\xe2\x80\x99ll kill her. On the other hand, if I don\xe2\x80\x99t give her grandchildren, that\xe2\x80\x99ll kill her, too. So, either way, on the Mom front, I\xe2\x80\x99m golden.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nSheldon: What time did you tell Amy to be here?\nPenny: Eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock. (Sheldon checks pocket watch) Sheldon, that pocket watch is ridiculous.\nSheldon: Nonsense. I look like a train conductor. Under what pretext did you lure her here?\nPenny: I said, hey, want to come over and hang out?\nSheldon: Good, good, if you had said something clever, she might\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten suspicious.\nAmy: Hey.\nPenny: Hi.\nAmy: What\xe2\x80\x99s he doing here?\nPenny: Okay, he wants to talk to you.\nAmy: Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to talk to him. And I\xe2\x80\x99m pretty disappointed in you, too. Although we both know that won\xe2\x80\x99t last.\nPenny: Sheldon, you\xe2\x80\x99re up.\nSheldon: Thank you. Amy, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to apologize. Your accomplishment was impressive. And I\xe2\x80\x99m proud of you.\nAmy: We both know that\xe2\x80\x99s your koala face.\nSheldon: I told you.\nPenny: Okay, look, he bought you this.\nAmy: Jewellery? Seriously? Sheldon, you are the most shallow, self-centred person I have ever met. Do you really think another transparently manip..oh! It\xe2\x80\x99s a tiara! A tiara! I have a tiara! Put it on me, put it on me, put it on me, put it on me, put it on me, put it on me, put it on me.\nPenny: You look beautiful.\nAmy: Of course I do, I\xe2\x80\x99m a princess, and this is my tiara!\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re right, the tiara was too much.\nScene: Howard\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Howard! Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\xa6 Oh, she slipped right by me.\nBernadette: Here\xe2\x80\x99s your vest back.\nHoward: You should keep it. You could wear it again sometime.\nBernadette: Where?\nHoward: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, hunting?\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Don\xe2\x80\x99t forget to talk to her about this mishegas where I don\xe2\x80\x99t get grandkids!\nHoward: Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry, Ma. I will, as soon as I can figure out a way to bring up such a sensitive issue!\nBernadette: I guess you talked to your mom, huh?\nHoward: I was upset. My mom can be a pretty good shoulder to cry on, if the smell of Bengay doesn\xe2\x80\x99t burn your eyes.\nBernadette: Look, it\xe2\x80\x99s obvious having kids is really important to you, and I think I came up with a solution.\nHoward: Really? That\xe2\x80\x99s great. What?\nBernadette: Well, seeing as how I make way more money than you anyway, what if I work and you stay home with the kids?\nHoward: Me?\nBernadette: Yeah. You know, you\xe2\x80\x99ll watch Barney and pull Cheerios out of their noses and go on play dates, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll work and have conversations with people my own age and enjoy my life.\nHoward: Yeah.\nBernadette: Yay, so we\xe2\x80\x99re good.\nHoward: Yeah, we\xe2\x80\x99re good.\nBernadette: You know, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if this counted as a fight, but how about some make-up sex?\nHoward: I would love that. But what is that behind your ear? Oh, look, it\xe2\x80\x99s a condom.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
