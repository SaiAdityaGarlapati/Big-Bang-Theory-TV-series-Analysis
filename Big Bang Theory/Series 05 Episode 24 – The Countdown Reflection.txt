b'Following a \xe2\x80\x9cPreviously on The Big Bang Theory\xe2\x80\x9d section\nScene: A Soyuz Spaceship capsule.\nMission Control (in Russian): Launch step twelve reading okay.\nCosmonaut (in Russian): Launch step twelve acknowledged.\nHoward: Hey Mike?\nMike Massimino: Yeah.\nHoward: I changed my mind. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to do this.\nMike: Good one.\nHoward: Yeah, I\xe2\x80\x99m a funny guy. I also have a hysterical bit planned for later where I pretend to cry through the whole launch.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: Sheldon, what channel is NASA TV?\nSheldon: 289, right between the Game Show Network at 288 and the East coast feed of the Disney Channel on 290.\nAmy: I love his eidetic memory, it\xe2\x80\x99s so sexy. Sheldon, what are the ingredients in Pringles?\nSheldon: Dried potatoes, vegetable oil, corn flower, wheat starch, maltodextrin, salt, and my favourite ingredient of all, uniformity.\nAmy: The uterus quivers, does it not?\nLeonard: There\xe2\x80\x99s Howard\xe2\x80\x99s rocket, live from Kazakhstan.\nBernadette: Oh, God, I\xe2\x80\x99m so nervous. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I can watch.\nRaj: You\xe2\x80\x99re nervous? I\xe2\x80\x99ve been stress-eating for four days. Look at me. I\xe2\x80\x99m wearing my fat pants.\nSheldon: Remarkable. In just under a half hour, 200 metric tons of fuel will ignite in a controlled explosion right beneath Howard\xe2\x80\x99s keister. And all from a country whose entire contribution to the global economy, has been Tetris and mail-order brides.\nBernadette: Give me those damn Pringles.\nScene: Soyuz capsule.\nCosmonaut (in Russian): Are all of the systems of the ship ready?\nMission Control: Da.\nMike: Okay, we\xe2\x80\x99re in the final countdown. How you doing over there?\nHoward: Good! Good! Oh, quick question, I missed it in the briefing. How much urine do these suits hold?\nCredits sequence.\nScene: Soyuz capsule.\nMike: Hey, Froot Loops, want to hit your fan switch?\nHoward: Check.\nCosmonaut: He calls you Froot Loops because of your very gay haircut?\nHoward: No, it\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x99cause I live with my mom and she makes me Froot Loops.\nCosmonaut: Go with gay story, people are more accepting of that.\nMike: Actually, Froot Loops just got married to a girl.\nCosmonaut: Congratulations.\nHoward: Thanks, we decided to do it before the launch.\nCosmonaut: You and Mrs. Loops have a big wedding?\nHoward: Not exactly. Listen, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind, I\xe2\x80\x99m not really up for chatting. I\xe2\x80\x99m just going to sit here quietly and let my life flash before my eyes. That went really quick. Let me try it again.\nScene: Howard\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom.\nHoward: Close your eyes. Put out your hand. I got you something special.\nBernadette: Come on, Howard. I\xe2\x80\x99m not falling for that again.\nHoward: No, here.\nBernadette: Oh, Howie. A little star, it\xe2\x80\x99s beautiful. Put it on me.\nHoward: Okay, but I\xe2\x80\x99m going to have to get it back from you so I can take it to the International Space Station. That way, when I come home, you will have a star that was actually in space.\nBernadette: Oh, my God.\nHoward: Take that, every guy who\xe2\x80\x99s ever bought you anything.\nBernadette: This is the most amazing gift I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever gotten.\nHoward: Really? Well, if you like it that much, then close your eyes and put out your hand.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): \xe2\x80\x98m going to the supermarket to buy snacks for your trip. Do you want me to get those little boxes of Froot Loops you like?\nHoward: No! When I eat Froot Loops, the other astronauts make fun of me!\nBernadette: Howard, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to wait until you\xe2\x80\x99re back to get married.\nHoward: What?\nBernadette: I want to be married to you before you get in that rocket.\nHoward: But I\xe2\x80\x99m leaving in two days.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): What about Apple Jacks?\nHoward: I don\xe2\x80\x99t need to take cereal.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): What kind of breakfast do you think they\xe2\x80\x99re going to give you in Russia?\nHoward: They invented blintzes. I\xe2\x80\x99ll be fine.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): They invented the lightbulb in New Jersey. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean they hand them out to you when you go.\nBernadette: We\xe2\x80\x99ll have a quick little ceremony with just our friends, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll still have the big reception with everyone when you get back.\nHoward: Wow. Okay. Let\xe2\x80\x99s get married.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): You know what, I\xe2\x80\x99ll buy you All-Bran in case you get stopped up in outer space.\nScene: The apartment.\nBernadette: So anyway, we decided to go down to City Hall this afternoon get married, and then have the reception when Howard gets back.\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99s so great. (Others also make encouraging sounds)\nHoward: I mean, we know it\xe2\x80\x99s short notice, but we\xe2\x80\x99d love you all to come with us.\nAmy: No, no, no, this is not the wedding I wanted! I want to wear my maid of honour dress and walk down the aisle with a hundred eyes on me, while a string quartet plays The Way You Look Tonight.\nBernadette: That wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to be our processional music.\nAmy: Well, it was going to be mine.\nSheldon: Thank you for the invitation, but I have to decline because it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t sound like something I\xe2\x80\x99ll enjoy.\nLeonard: Come on, Sheldon, it\xe2\x80\x99ll be fun.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s what you said about The Green Lantern movie. You were 114 minutes of wrong.\nBernadette: So, what do you say, Amy?\nAmy: Can I wear my maid of honour dress?\nBernadette: Seriously? You\xe2\x80\x99re going to wear that thing to City Hall?\nAmy: It\xe2\x80\x99s all I have left. You\xe2\x80\x99re going to take that from me, too?\nScene: City Hall.\nPenny: Amy, you look great.\nAmy: I know.\nLeonard: Where\xe2\x80\x99d you get a beer?\nRaj: From that happy young couple over there with all the tattoos. Beautiful story, they\xe2\x80\x99re in rival drug gangs, and they\xe2\x80\x99re getting married. Shh, no one can know.\nAmy: Look at all these people in love. It kind of gets you thinking, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\nSheldon: It does, indeed. Leonard, is it awkward being here with Penny given that you recently proposed to her?\nHoward: You proposed to Penny?\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to talk about it.\nRaj: Where did he pop the question? What did you say?\nLeonard: She said no, can we drop it now?\nPenny: It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a real proposal.\nBernadette: Why wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it a real proposal?\nSheldon: He asked her during coitus.\nHoward: Did you get down on one knee or were you already there?\nBernadette: Howard, don\xe2\x80\x99t talk like that on your wedding day.\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, Ma\xe2\x80\xa6 Bernadette. Ma\xe2\x80\xa6 Burna\xe2\x80\xa6 You\xe2\x80\x99re ma Bernadette.\nPenny: Good move telling Sheldon.\nLeonard: What, I can\xe2\x80\x99t propose? I can\xe2\x80\x99t talk to my friends? Is there anything else I\xe2\x80\x99m not allowed to do?\nAmy: All right, that\xe2\x80\x99s enough. Today is not about you two. Today is about Howard and Bernadette and me.\nRegistrar: Folks, can I have your attention. It\xe2\x80\x99s five o\xe2\x80\x99clock, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be able to take three more couples. The rest of you will have to come back on Monday.\nBernadette: Oh, no.\nHoward: I got this. Excuse me, but is there any way you could squeeze us in? See, I\xe2\x80\x99m an astronaut and I\xe2\x80\x99m leaving for Russia on Sunday so I can take a Soyuz rocket to the International Space Station.\nRegistrar: Yeah, me, too. I\xe2\x80\x99ll see you there.\nBernadette: I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to get married.\nAmy: Excuse me, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to go see if the couple at the front of the line needs a maid of honour.\nScene: Soyuz capsule.\nCosmonaut: So, I tell my wife, get a dog, don\xe2\x80\x99t get a dog, I\xe2\x80\x99m not walking it, I\xe2\x80\x99m not feeding it, I\xe2\x80\x99m not picking up after it.\nMike: You know you\xe2\x80\x99re going to wind up walking it.\nCosmonaut: I know.\nHoward: Uh, shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you guys be talking about space stuff instead of dogs?\nMike: Dimitri, Froot Loops would be more comfortable if we talked about space stuff.\nDimitri: Okay, I\xe2\x80\x99m going into space, and when I come back, I have to pick up a poodle crap.\nMike: Is that better?\nHoward: Thanks.\nScene: The Cheesecake Factory bar.\nHoward: You know, we could always drive to Vegas and get married.\nBernadette: No, isn\xe2\x80\x99t that kind of tacky?\nPenny: Hey, I know tons of people who got married in Vegas.\nBernadette: Are any of them still married?\nPenny: Yeah, I mean, not to the same people but\xe2\x80\xa6\nBernadette: There\xe2\x80\x99s got to be some place special we could do it.\nSheldon: Leonard, where did you envision marrying Penny?\nLeonard: Will you shut up?\nRaj: Well, I know how to make it special.\nHoward: I told you we are not recreating the wedding from The Sound of Music.\nRaj: Yes, you made that brutally clear to me. What I was going to suggest is if that you\xe2\x80\x99re willing to wait until Sunday morning, the Google satellite will be over Pasadena. You can have a wedding photograph from space.\nAll: Oh!\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99s so cool.\nHoward: Oh, wait to go, Raj.\nRaj: I keep telling you, if I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t an astrophysicist, I would have been a party planner. It was always a coin flip.\nHoward: Okay, so we know we\xe2\x80\x99re going to do it Sunday morning. Now we need to find a good place for the satellite to see us.\nLeonard: How about our roof?\nBernadette: Oh, I like that.\nHoward: That\xe2\x80\x99s great.\nAmy: Oh, my gosh. I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe my maid of honour dress is going to be on Google Earth.\nHoward: So, we have the where and the when, but we still need to figure out who\xe2\x80\x99s going to do the ceremony.\nPenny: Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s easy. Anyone can go online and get ordained as a minister. I know a piercing parlour where, for a hundred bucks they\xe2\x80\x99ll marry you and stick a wedding ring through any body part you want.\nBernadette: Great, well, who\xe2\x80\x99s it going to be?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99ll do it, provided I can perform the ceremony in Klingon.\nBernadette: No.\nSheldon: What do you see in her?\nScene: Soyuz capsule.\nDimitri (in Russian): Mission Control, say again, how fast is it leaking?\nHoward: Leaking? What\xe2\x80\x99s leaking?\nDimitri: Fuel. Shh.\nMission Control (in Russian): Not bad. We feel okay to go.\nDimitri (in Russian): Okay, thanks Mission Control.\nHoward: There\xe2\x80\x99s fuel leaking and we\xe2\x80\x99re still going to go?\nMike: Don\xe2\x80\x99t lose your Froot Loops, Froot Loops.\nDimitri: This happens a lot. Nine times out of ten, no problem.\nHoward: What happens on the tenth time?\nDimitri: Problem.\nScene: The apartment.\nHoward: Hey, guys, before I forget, I got you a little groomsman present.\nRaj: Oh, thanks, man.\nSheldon: You didn\xe2\x80\x99t have to do that.\nHoward: Fantastic Four, annual number three from 1965, in mint condition. The one where Mr. Fantastic and the Invisible Girl get married.\nLeonard: Oh, wow.\nSheldon: Oh, dear. I was afraid of this.\nHoward: What?\nSheldon: While a thoughtful gift, this comic book in this condition is worth at least a hundred dollars.\nHoward: Yeah, so?\nSheldon: I bought you and Bernadette a gravy boat worth eighty-eight dollars. Which places me in your debt and I can\xe2\x80\x99t be in your debt because someday you might ask me to help you move, or to kill a man.\nLeonard: I doubt he\xe2\x80\x99ll ask you to kill a man.\nSheldon: Well, what if it\xe2\x80\x99s his only way out? I can\xe2\x80\x99t risk it. Here is twelve dollars. Now, we\xe2\x80\x99re even. Wait, wait, wait, I bought a card. Give me two dollars. And for the record, this is why I hate gift-giving.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s door. Howard knocks.\nAmy: Who is it?\nHoward: It\xe2\x80\x99s the groom.\nAmy: Can\xe2\x80\x99t come in. Bad luck to see the bride.\nHoward: Okay, uh, fine. Bernie, I have to go pick up my mother. I\xe2\x80\x99ll be right back.\nBernadette (off): Why can\xe2\x80\x99t she drive herself?\nHoward: She doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to sit in her dress and wrinkle it so I\xe2\x80\x99m going to lay her down in the back of my neighbour\xe2\x80\x99s van.\nBernadette (off): All right, just hurry!\nHoward: Okay, I\xe2\x80\x99ll see you later, Ma\xe2\x80\xa6 uh\xe2\x80\xa6 lovely bride-to-be. I really got to watch that.\nScene: The roof.\nLeonard: Come on, Raj, we\xe2\x80\x99re ready to start.\nRaj: What, we\xe2\x80\x99re ready when I say we\xe2\x80\x99re ready. Uh-du-du-du, ooh, okay, now we\xe2\x80\x99re ready.\nHoward: Ma, you want to move your chair over here so you can see?\nMrs Wolowitz (off): I\xe2\x80\x99m fine where I am. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to fall off the roof.\nHoward: You\xe2\x80\x99ll fall through the roof before you fall off it.\nRaj: Penny. (She starts music playing)\nMr Rostenkowski: Your new mother-in-law\xe2\x80\x99s a piece of work.\nBernadette: Not now, Dad.\nMr Rostenkowski: She\xe2\x80\x99s got a bigger mustache than me. Here you go.\nBernadette: Here you go? What am I, a football?\nMr Rostenkowski: Like that guy could catch a football.\nRaj: Howard and Bernadette, the five of us stand before you as your friends and newly ordained ministers.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Louder!\nBernadette: They all got ordained, they\xe2\x80\x99re all marrying us, it\xe2\x80\x99s adorable, if you want to hear come closer.\nRaj: Guys, when I look at the two of you starting your lives together, it fills my heart, It fills my, heart, okay, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to need a minute.\nPenny: Okay, I\xe2\x80\x99ll, I\xe2\x80\x99ll go. Howard and Bernadette, I know you two planned on getting married in a big fancy wedding, but when you\xe2\x80\x99re in love, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter where or how these things happen. It just matters that you have each other.\nLeonard: Hmm.\nPenny: Problem?\nLeonard: No.\nSheldon: I think the Reverend Hofstadter is making an ironic connection between your statement about love and your rejection of his proposal in the bedroom.\nPenny: Oh, grow up.\nLeonard: Hey, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t say it.\nAmy: All right, that\xe2\x80\x99s enough from the both of you.\nPenny: Well, he started it.\nAmy: Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m ending it. Bernadette, I want to thank you for allowing me to be your maid of honour. I also want you to know, that I will be happy to do it again if this marriage craps out.\nLeonard: Thank you, Amy. Very touching. Howard and Bernadette, you are lucky enough to be best friends who love each other. And that\xe2\x80\x99s the strongest kind of love because at its core, it has kindness, patience, and respect. Qualities that are hard to find in people these days.\nSheldon: Would you like some aloe vera? You just got burned. All right, my turn. Howard, Bernadette. Daq tu\xe2\x80\x99 taH Daq yIn tlhej ghajtaH.\nBernadette: Sheldon! I told you no Klingon.\nSheldon: Fine, I\xe2\x80\x99ll do it in English, but it loses something. The need to find another human being to share one\xe2\x80\x99s life with has always puzzled me. Maybe because I\xe2\x80\x99m so interesting all by myself. With that being said, may you find as much happiness with each other as I find on my own. The Klingon would have made you cry.\nRaj: I believe you two have prepared vows?\nBernadette: Howard Joel Wolowitz, like you, this is going to be short and sweet. I love you with all my heart and soul and promise to be with you forever.\nHoward: Bernadette Maryann Rostenkowski.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Speak up!\nHoward: Hey, from now on, she\xe2\x80\x99s the only women who can yell at me! Until I met you, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t imagine spending my life with just one person. And now I can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine spending one day of it without you.\nAll: By the power vested in us, by the state of California\xe2\x80\xa6\nSheldon: And the Klingon High Council\xe2\x80\xa6\nAll: We now pronounce you husband and wife.\nScene: Soyuz capsule.\nMike: That\xe2\x80\x99s ignition. I love this part.\nDimitri: Me, too.\nHoward: I have strongly mixed feelings.\nScene: The apartment.\nBernadette: Oh, my God, it\xe2\x80\x99s happening.\nPenny: Did I miss it?\nLeonard: No, come on in. Hurry.\nBernadette: I love that man.\nRaj: Me, too.\nPenny: I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe it. This whole time, a small part of me thought he was lying.\nLeonard: This is it.\nSheldon: Boldly go, Howard Wolowitz.\n(Russian countdown ends, rocket takes off)\nHoward (voice off): Oy vay!\nTeleplay: Chuck Lorre, Steven Molaro & Jim Reynolds\nStory: Bill Prady, Eric Kaplan & Steve Holland\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
