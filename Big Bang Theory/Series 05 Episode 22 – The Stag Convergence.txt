b'Scene: The cafeteria. Sheldon laughs to himself.\nSheldon: I wish you could all be inside my head. The conversation is sparkling. (Pause) Fine, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you. A lichen is an organism made up of two separate species, fungi and algae. If you could merge with another species, what species would you pick and why? Hint, there is a right answer. None of you will get it.\nRaj: Okay, uh, I\xe2\x80\x99d pick swan because, uh, the resulting hybrid would have the advanced industrial civilization of a human and the long graceful neck I\xe2\x80\x99ve always dreamed of having.\nSheldon: Wrong. Leonard?\nLeonard: Horse, but mostly just for the height. A little bit for the genital girth.\nSheldon: Wrong, and let\xe2\x80\x99s keep it clean, shall we?\nHoward: Kangaroo, uh, I\xe2\x80\x99d be a Kanga-Jew. The first of my people to dunk a basketball.\nLeonard: Also instead of just living in your mother\xe2\x80\x99s house, you could actually live inside her body.\nSheldon: Clever, but also wrong. No, the best organism for human beings to merge with is the lichen itself. That way, you\xe2\x80\x99d be human, fungus, and algae. Triple threat. Like three-bean salad.\nLeonard: Give me one circumstance in which that would be useful.\nSheldon: All right, picture this, a beautiful outdoor concert. Now, as a human, I appreciate Beethoven. As a fungus, I have a terrific view, growing out of a towering maple tree. And no thank you, expensive concessions. Because as an algae, I\xe2\x80\x99ll just snack on this sunlight.\nRaj: He got us again.\nLeonard: No, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t.\nRaj: Anyway, if it\xe2\x80\x99s okay with you, we should talk about Howard\xe2\x80\x99s bachelor party.\nSheldon: Well, seems like a bit of a let down after our lichen conversation, but, what do you know, you\xe2\x80\x99re half swan.\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99ve been doing some research on strippers. One agency I spoke to, said I could get us a great price if we\xe2\x80\x99re flexible on age range and number of limbs.\nHoward: Sounds like loads of fun, but I promised Bernadette no strippers.\nRaj: You don\xe2\x80\x99t want strippers? You\xe2\x80\x99re the king of strippers. The one club in North Hollywood named a pole after you.\nHoward: What can I tell ya, I\xe2\x80\x99m not into that stuff any more.\nLeonard: Good for you, Howard. I\xe2\x80\x99m proud of you. And still, you\xe2\x80\x99re the first one of us to get married. We have to do something special.\nSheldon: You know Germans have an interesting pre-wedding custom.\nHoward: Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s probably not for me.\nRaj: Maybe we can go up to Napa Valley. They\xe2\x80\x99ve got that wine train.\nSheldon: Boo, wine! But yay, trains. I\xe2\x80\x99m in.\nRaj: Anyway, it\xe2\x80\x99s a beautiful time of year. Uh, you travel through the vineyards. There\xe2\x80\x99s a tasting on board. And all the wild flowers are in bloom. It\xe2\x80\x99s magic.\nLeonard: Look at that, in 30 seconds, we went from hiring women to being them.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The stairwell.\nPenny: So, I hear you and the lost boys are having a bachelor party tonight.\nLeonard: Yeah, just going to a restaurant, get some steaks and scotch. Nothing to worry about.\nPenny: Why should I worry?\nLeonard: Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. It\xe2\x80\x99s a bachelor party. There could be strippers. Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t that make you a little jealous?\nPenny: Oh, come on Leonard, it\xe2\x80\x99s you. What\xe2\x80\x99s going to happen? I mean, even if there was a stripper, all you\xe2\x80\x99d do is avoid eye-contact and maybe offer to help her kid with his homework.\nLeonard: Hey, I am a young man in his sexual prime. Under the right conditions, I-I-I am capable of just, really crazy stuff.\nPenny: Really? What is the craziest thing you\xe2\x80\x99ve ever done with a woman? And the time you and I had sex in the ocean does not count.\nLeonard: Oh, come on, that\xe2\x80\x99s got to count. There was a really strong undertow, we could have died.\nPenny: Well, have fun tonight.\nLeonard: Oh, I will. There is no telling what might happen.\nPenny: Yeah, there is.\nLeonard: You know, there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing wrong helping some woman\xe2\x80\x99s kid get through their S.A.T.\xe2\x80\x99s.\nScene: A restaurant.\nLeonard: Hey, I got to hand it to Raj, he found a really nice spot to have a bachelor party.\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s not bad. Unless you compare it to a train; then it stinks.\nLeonard: Are you drinking whisky?\nSheldon: Indeed. If I\xe2\x80\x99m to participate in the social convention that is the stag night, then I must embrace all its components, including tobacco, swear words, and yes, alcohol. Jeepers! That\xe2\x80\x99s yucky.\nLeonard: Whoa, it\xe2\x80\x99s a little early to start dropping J-bombs, don\xe2\x80\x99t you think?\nWil Wheaton: Hey, you guys.\nLeonard: Oh, hey, Wil. Nice of you to make it out tonight for Howard.\nWil: Well, it was either this or another hot tub party at George Takei\xe2\x80\x99s house.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m confused. I thought since our reconciliation, I was your friend in this group.\nWil: Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m friends with Howard too.\nSheldon: Oh. I guess you\xe2\x80\x99re just friends with anybody. (Drinks) Aagh!\nStuart: Hey, uh, Leonard, things are a little tight at the comic book store. I might need some help covering my share of the check.\nLeonard: Oh, yeah, no worries.\nStuart: And maybe a few bucks for the valet.\nLeonard: Oh, all right.\nStuart: And gas money to get home.\nLeonard: Yeah, sure.\nStuart: Great. You know what? This is my grandfather\xe2\x80\x99s watch.\nLeonard: Oh.\nStuart: 18-carat gold, got it in Europe during the war.\nLeonard: Wow, that\xe2\x80\x99s very nice.\nStuart: Mm-hmm. A hundred bucks and it\xe2\x80\x99s yours.\nRaj: Hey, everybody! The bachelor boy has arrived! For he\xe2\x80\x99s a jolly good fellow\xe2\x80\xa6\nAll (joining in): For he\xe2\x80\x99s a jolly good fellow, for he\xe2\x80\x99s a jolly good fellow, which nobody can deny.\nKripke: Yes, yes, yes. He\xe2\x80\x99s a jowwy good fewwow. What time do the stwippers awwive?\nHoward: Actually, Barry, we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to have strippers tonight.\nKripke: Ah, then what the fwig did I get two hundwed dowwaws in singles out for?\nStuart: You want to buy a watch?\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nAmy (into a mini-cam): This is Maid of Honour Amy Farrah Fowler, bringing you the wedding activities just weeks out from the big day. Let\xe2\x80\x99s check in with a beautiful, radiant young woman, and her friend who\xe2\x80\x99s about to get married. Ladies, can you tell us what you\xe2\x80\x99re doing?\nBernadette: Um, these are gift bags we\xe2\x80\x99re going to put in the hotel rooms of our out-of-town guests. This is a map of Pasadena. This is a list of local restaurants. And then, for Howie\xe2\x80\x99s relatives, we have antihistamines, antacids, and medicine for diarrhoea and constipation.\nPenny: Yeah, we labeled them stop and go.\nAmy: All right, pivoting to the big question. Bernadette, on your wedding night you\xe2\x80\x99ll be consummating your marriage. What do you think your first sexual position will be as husband and wife?\nBernadette: Amy, please.\nAmy: Keeping in mind that whoever\xe2\x80\x99s on top may set the tone for the marriage.\nPenny: Okay, show\xe2\x80\x99s over.\nAmy: Hey, they may conceive a child on their wedding night. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you think the kid might get a kick out of knowing how it happened?\nPenny: I don\xe2\x80\x99t care. Ask her things like are you going to take Howard\xe2\x80\x99s name? Not who\xe2\x80\x99s going to sit on who?\nBernadette: I\xe2\x80\x99ve actually been thinking I\xe2\x80\x99m going to hyphenate: Bernadette Mary-Ann Rostenkowski-Wolowitz.\nPenny: Nice. You know, you should totally get BernadetteMaryAnnRostenkowskiWolowitz.com before someone snaps it up.\nBernadette: Howard already took care of it. Plus, he set up our beautiful wedding website with cute little facts about our family histories. Do you know, for a while in Poland, my family and his family were neighbours.\nPenny: Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s cool.\nAmy: No, it\xe2\x80\x99s not. I\xe2\x80\x99ll explain it to you later.\nScene: The restaurant.\nRaj: May I have your attention, please? We are hear tonight to celebrate the upcoming nuptials of my best friend Howard Wolowitz.\nAll: Hear! Hear!\nSheldon: And, apparently, Wil Wheaton\xe2\x80\x99s best friend.\nWil: Sheldon\xe2\x80\xa6\nSheldon: Talk to the hand.\nRaj: Does anyone have any words they\xe2\x80\x99d like to say about our man of the evening?\nSheldon: Yeah, I do. (All groan). As is the tradition, I have prepared a series of disrespectful jokes which generate humour at Howard\xe2\x80\x99s expense. Prepare to have your ribs tickled. Howard, I always thought you\xe2\x80\x99d be the last one of us to ever get married, because you are so short and unappealing. Am I right? Let\xe2\x80\x99s see here. Oh, seriously though, Howard, you\xe2\x80\x99re actually one of the most intelligent people I know. And that\xe2\x80\x99s a zinger, because you\xe2\x80\x99re not. I\xe2\x80\x99ve always thought that you\xe2\x80\x99d make someone a fine husband someday. Assuming you\xe2\x80\x99d be able to get the parts, and develop the engineering skills to assemble them, which I don\xe2\x80\x99t see as likely. Hacha! Okay, let me see here. Okay, kidding aside, Howard, you are a good friend. And I wish you nothing but happiness. Bazinga, I don\xe2\x80\x99t!\nLeonard: Sheldon\xe2\x80\xa6\nSheldon: Doubleazinga! I do! Good luck following that.\nLeonard: So, Howard Wolowitz tying the knot. Leaving his crazy bachelor days behind. He was a wild one. Well, I guess we all kind of were. I remember this one time, I was with this girl at the beach. We were in the ocean and we started making out. I know, it was crazy. I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t even wearing my Aquasocks. Then\xe2\x80\xa6\nKripke: Nobody cares, Hofstadter. Wwap it up.\nLeonard: Right. To Howard.\nAll: To Howard.\nLeonard: I totally had sex in the ocean.\nStuart: Okay, I\xe2\x80\x99ll go. Howard, when I think about you and Bernadette starting this wonderful life together, I can\xe2\x80\x99t help but get a little choked up. I mean, look at you. You have everything. Look at me. I\xe2\x80\x99m 37. I sleep in the back of a comic book store, and I have the bone density of an 80-year-old man. To Howard.\nRaj: Yeah, to Howard. Um, uh, who\xe2\x80\x99s next?\nKripke: I\xe2\x80\x99ll go. Howard, I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna say something to you that evewybody\xe2\x80\x99s thinking but no one has the couwage to say out woud. When you invite a man to a bachewor pawty, the impwication is, there will be stwippews. Maybe not compwetewy nude, but at weast pasties and G-stwings. That\xe2\x80\x99s not unweasonable.\nRaj: Hear, hear.\nAll: Hear, hear.\nRaj: Okay, uh, anybody else? Huh? No? Okay, it all comes down to me, the best man. Ooh! This grasshopper is kicking my ass-hopper. Okay, when I first came to this country, I-I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know how to behave or how to dress, or what was cool, I was pretty lonely. But then I met Howard, and suddenly, my life changed, because we could be lonely together. This man became my whole world.\nKripke: Yeah, nice speech, Fwancine. (Tucks a dollar in Raj\xe2\x80\x99s pants.)\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99m not done, but thank you. (Raj puts the dollar on the table. Stuart steals it.) I think back to all the good times we had, like, uh, when we went camping and spent that night telling each other all our secrets. I told him I\xe2\x80\x99m addicted to pedicures and he told me he lost his virginity to his cousin.\nHoward: She was my second cousin.\nSheldon: And the first woman you ever disappointed sexually. Ba-da-bazinga!\nRaj: Oh, oh, yeah, and then there was the time when Leonard and I took Howard to Las Vegas and paid a hooker to pretend she was Jewish and that she wanted his little kosher pickle. Of all the Howard humping hookers stories, that one\xe2\x80\x99s my favourite!\nHoward: Okay, buddy, that\xe2\x80\x99s it. Sit down.\nRaj: Oh, oh, what about that tubby girl in the Sailor Moon costume at Comic-con?\nHoward: Don\xe2\x80\x99t remember. Please sit down.\nRaj: The only threesome I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever had in my life, and I\xe2\x80\x99m proud to say it was with this man right here.\nHoward: Oh, please shut up.\nRaj: Oh, oh, don\xe2\x80\x99t get me wrong, nothing happened with me and Howard. There was about 200 pounds of Sailor Moon between us.\nWil (filming on his phone): Oh, Internet, this is so going all over you.\nSheldon: Jeepers, I\xe2\x80\x99m drunk.\nScene: Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s car.\nHoward: Thank you for picking us up. There\xe2\x80\x99s a warning, right there, on the scotch bottle. You cannot be operatin\xe2\x80\x99 heavy machinery after you had a snootful of this, laddie!\nBernadette: Funny. You boys have a nice time?\nHoward: Yeah, it was great. And low-key, like I promised. No hanky-panky, no strippers. Just the guys telling jokes.\nBernadette: That\xe2\x80\x99s nice.\nHoward: How about you? Did you have a fun night? Yeah, we, uh, made gift bags, had wine, and then went online and saw this.\nRaj\xe2\x80\x99s Voice: Of all the Howard humping hookers stories, that one\xe2\x80\x99s my favourite.\nRaj: You know, we\xe2\x80\x99re not that far from my apartment. If you stop the car, I can walk from here.\nBernadette: You ain\xe2\x80\x99t goin\xe2\x80\x99 anywhere, Threeway.\nHoward: Bernadette, listen\xe2\x80\xa6\nBernadette: You lied to me. You said you told me about all the girls you\xe2\x80\x99ve been with, but you never mentioned your cousin, the prostitute or Raj!\nRaj: Seriously, you don\xe2\x80\x99t even have to stop the car. Anything under ten miles an hour and I can combat-roll into the street.\nHoward: Okay, just to set the record straight, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t hire the prostitute, she was a gift from him. Shame on you, Raj. That is not how we treat women in this country.\nBernadette: Don\xe2\x80\x99t you try and blame this on him.\nRaj: Thank you, Bernadette.\nBernadette: Zip it, pervert!\nScene: Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nBernadette: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what I\xe2\x80\x99m going to do. I\xe2\x80\x99m supposed to marry Howard in a couple of weeks and I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure I even know who the man is any more.\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99m curious what\xe2\x80\x99s bothering you most, the borderline incest, the prostitute or group sex with the girl dressed as the children\xe2\x80\x99s cartoon?\nPenny: Amy, remember when we went over things that would be helpful and things that wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t?\nAmy: Right. And that was\xe2\x80\xa6\nPenny: Not.\nBernadette: When I first met Howard, he seemed so innocent to me, just a sweet little guy who lives with his mother.\nPenny: Well, if that\xe2\x80\x99s what you like, I\xe2\x80\x99ll take you to the comic book store, the place is full of \xe2\x80\x99em.\nBernadette: Wait a minute. You set me up with Howard. Did you know about all the creepy stuff he was into?\nPenny: Well, a little. You hear stuff.\nBernadette: Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you tell me\nPenny: Well, I was gonna, but I didn\xe2\x80\x99t think it would go past the first date. Then, when it did, I thought for sure it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go past you meeting his mother. Definitely not past the two of you sleeping together. I mean, the warning signs were there, this is really on you.\nBernadette: My God! I thought you were my friend. (Runs to bedroom)\nAmy: I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that was helpful.\nScene: The apartment. Howard is on the phone.\nHoward: Hi, Bernie, it\xe2\x80\x99s me again. Please call me back.\nRaj: Dude, I am so sorry.\nHoward: It\xe2\x80\x99s not your fault, it\xe2\x80\x99s mine. I did all that stuff, not you.\nLeonard: Actually, you did do one of them together.\nSheldon: Here.\nHoward: What is this?\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re upset. The convention is to bring an upset person a hot beverage.\nHoward: No, but what is it?\nSheldon: Chicken broth. It seemed culturally appropriate. Also, there was a single cube of chicken bouillon in the cupboard when I moved in and it\xe2\x80\x99s been bothering me for the last eight years. So, as they say, two birds.\nHoward: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what my next move is.\nLeonard: Well, Howard, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know much about women.\nHoward: Yeah?\nLeonard: No, uh, that, that\xe2\x80\x99s it. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know much about women. Raj, you got anything?\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99ve got the phone number of the tubby girl from Comic-Con.\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m not calling the girl from Comic-con.\nRaj: All right. More Sailor Moon for me.\nSheldon: I just threw up the bachelor party.\nScene: Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nPenny: Please come out, Bernadette. Let\xe2\x80\x99s talk through this.\nBernadette: No, leave me alone.\nAmy: Perhaps you should give him a taste of his own medicine. Do you have a cousin who you find attractive?\nPenny: Amy.\nAmy: Hey, you introduced him to the sleazebag. I\xe2\x80\x99m just trying to clean up your mess.\nHoward (at the door): Oh, hi.\nPenny: Hey.\nHoward: I need to talk to Bernadette.\nPenny: Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think she wants to talk to anyone right now.\nHoward: All right, well, could you at least give her a message?\nPenny: Yeah, sure, I guess.\nHoward: Tell her I\xe2\x80\x99m really sorry, and if she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to marry me, I get it. But what I really want her to know is the guy that she\xe2\x80\x99s disgusted by, is the guy that I\xe2\x80\x99m disgusted by, too. But that guy doesn\xe2\x80\x99t exist any more, he\xe2\x80\x99s gone, and the reason is because of her. So, if this relationship is over, let her know that she made me a better man, and tell her thank you.\nPenny: Oh, my God, Howard. That\xe2\x80\x99s the most beautiful thing I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever heard. And it came out of you.\nBernadette: Howie?\nHoward: Penny has a message for you.\nBernadette: I heard. Your voice, not unlike your mother\xe2\x80\x99s, travels through walls.\nHoward: Do you want me to go?\nBernadette: No. Come here. I\xe2\x80\x99m still really mad at you.\nHoward: I get that.\nBernadette: Is there anything else about your past I should know?\nHoward: Couple things, but, you know, most of them happened overseas. I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you later.\nBernadette: Okay.\nHoward: So, is the wedding still on?\nBernadette: Yeah, the wedding\xe2\x80\x99s still on. (They hug)\nAmy: Oh, thank God. I\xe2\x80\x99m still a maid of honour. (Joins in the hug)\nPenny: Oh, what the hell. (Joins in too)\nAmy: This is kind of hot.\nScene: The laundry room. Leonard enters in his dressing gown.\nLeonard: Hello.\nPenny: What\xe2\x80\x99s with the robe?\nLeonard (taking it off): I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna have sex with you right here, right now, on that washing machine.\nPenny: No, you\xe2\x80\x99re not.\nLeonard: Come on, please.\nPenny: If you want to do something, you can help me fold this sheet.\nLeonard: Folding a sheet in my underwear, still pretty crazy.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
