b'Scene: A public washroom. Amy and Penny are in cubicles, Bernadette is washing her hands.\nAmy: I must say, Penny, this is great fun.\nPenny: Glad you\xe2\x80\x99re enjoying yourself.\nAmy: Until I met you and Bernadette, my trips to the bathroom had been entirely focused on elimination. Now they have a delightful social aspect.\nBernadette: Amy, you must\xe2\x80\x99ve been in the bathroom with other women before.\nAmy: Of course I have. But they were strangers and seemed off-put when I engaged in friendly stall-to-stall chit-chat.\nBernadette: Some women don\xe2\x80\x99t like to get chummy when their panties are down.\nAmy: You okay in there, bestie?\nPenny: I\xe2\x80\x99m fine.\nAmy: The reason I ask is that many people experience bladder shyness, the inability to pass urine\nPenny: Yeah, I said I\xe2\x80\x99m fine. Stop talking to me.\nAmy: She always this crabby when she urinates?\nBernadette: We\xe2\x80\x99re really not that close.\nPenny: Screw it. I\xe2\x80\x99ll go later.\nAmy: And I\xe2\x80\x99ll be right by your side.\nScene: A shoe shop.\nBernadette: Did I tell you Priya invited me and Howard to have dinner with her and Leonard?\nPenny: Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s nice.\nAmy: No, it\xe2\x80\x99s not. It\xe2\x80\x99s a strategic manoeuvre. Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s new girlfriend is testing Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s loyalty to you and the group. That bitch is crafty.\nBernadette: You think?\nAmy: Of course. How does the cheetah attack a herd of wildebeests? By going after its weakest member.\nBernadette: Well, what makes me the weakest member?\nAmy: Your trusting nature coupled with your teeny-tiny body. You wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t last a minute on the Serengeti.\nPenny: Okay, Amy, you\xe2\x80\x99re being silly. I am not concerned about who hangs out with who. And I certainly don\xe2\x80\x99t have a problem with Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s new girlfriend who wears way too much makeup. Ooh, these are cute. Of course if I buy them, I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to rent my womb out to a gay couple.\nBernadette: It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to tell her we can\xe2\x80\x99t make it.\nAmy: Oh, no. You have to go.\nBernadette: I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand. I thought I was a teeny-tiny wildebeest.\nAmy: You are, with hair that smells like strawberries. And we\xe2\x80\x99re going to use that to our advantage.\nPenny: Wait. What are you talking about?\nAmy: By accepting the invitation, Bernadette becomes a double agent inside the enemy camp. She could ferret out Priya\xe2\x80\x99s tactics, identify her weaknesses and feed her false information, such as, Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s no stranger to back-alley cockfights.\nBernadette: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I\xe2\x80\x99m not a very good liar. They kind of whup that out of you in Catholic school.\nAmy: Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry. I\xe2\x80\x99ll teach you. I did two years of Cub Scouts before they found out I was a girl.\nPenny: Okay, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know you people. I\xe2\x80\x99m just an innocent woman wondering if this shoe store will take my Texaco card.\nAmy: How do you feel about concealing a recording device in the cleavage of your ample bosom?\nBernadette: I don\xe2\x80\x99t want anything in my ample bosom.\nAmy: Come on, Strawberries. Take one for the team.\nCredits sequence\nLeonard: Okay, see you later.\nSheldon: Good news. I finally have a handle on my idea for three-person chess.\nLeonard: That is good news. Bye.\nSheldon: Uh, do you know how I solved the balanced centre combat-area problem? Five words, transitional quadrilateral to triangular tessellation.\nLeonard: That, that\xe2\x80\x99s brilliant.\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s what I do. But wait, there\xe2\x80\x99s more. I also invented two new chess pieces. The serpent, and the old woman.\nLeonard: Okay, now I have to ask. What do they do?\nSheldon: When the serpent slithers to an opposing player\xe2\x80\x99s piece, that piece is considered poisoned and will die after two more moves. Ugh.\nLeonard: All right.\nSheldon: Unless, it gets to the old woman in time, in which case she sucks out the poison, turning her into the Grand Empress, a piece combining the power of the knight, queen and serpent.\nLeonard: Elegant.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s because it\xe2\x80\x99s simple.\nLeonard: Okay, well, I look forward to playing with you.\nSheldon: And\xe2\x80\xa6\nLeonard: And what?\nSheldon: And a third person. It\xe2\x80\x99s three-person chess. I must say, ever since you started having regular intercourse, your mind has lost its keen edge. You should reflect on that.\nLeonard: Excuse me, but Einstein had a pretty busy sex life.\nSheldon: Yes, and he never unified gravity with the other forces. If he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been such a hound dog, we\xe2\x80\x99d all have time machines.\nLeonard: Got it. Bye.\nSheldon: You know I\xe2\x80\x99m right.\nLeonard (outside apartment): I think he\xe2\x80\x99s getting worse.\nAmy: Oh, my metatarsal are barking.\nLeonard: You okay?\nAmy: Yeah, yeah. I\xe2\x80\x99m just breaking in some new shoes.\nLeonard: Very pretty.\nAmy: Thank you. Did you know that women wear high heels to make the buttocks and breasts more prominent?\nLeonard: Hadn\xe2\x80\x99t really thought about it.\nAmy: Look.\nLeonard: Uh, sure. Very\xe2\x80\xa6 prominent.\nAmy: Please, Leonard, don\xe2\x80\x99t leer, you have a girlfriend.\nLeonard: Sorry.\nAmy: So, are you off to dinner with Priya, Howard and Bernadette?\nLeonard: Yeah. How did you know?\nAmy: I heard it at the mall, when I was shopping with my girlfriends, \xe2\x80\x99cause, you know, that\xe2\x80\x99s kind of my life now. Have a good night. Try not to ogle my caboose as I walk away.\nScene: Raj\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nPriya: Hey, you.\nLeonard: Hi. Hey, Raj, will you be joining us for dinner?\nRaj: The lonely guy and the two happy couples? I\xe2\x80\x99d rather get a prostate exam from a leper who walks away with nine fingers.\nPriya: Oh, would you please stop feeling sorry for yourself?\nRaj: I have to feel sorry for myself. I\xe2\x80\x99m the only one who cares. Just like I\xe2\x80\x99m the only one who\xe2\x80\x99ll have sex with me.\nLeonard: Really? In front of your sister?\nPriya: We shared a room growing up. This is not news to me.\nRaj: Excuse me. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to go wander the streets alone. Invisible, unwanted and unloved, a pathetic shadow in a city with no heart. (Leaves, then returns a moment later) I forgot my windbreaker. It\xe2\x80\x99s chilly.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nAmy: I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand. Is this a way to break in new shoes?\nPenny: No. Once these puppies touch the ground they\xe2\x80\x99re mine, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to wear them walking up and down Hollywood Boulevard in order to pay them off. Pretty, pretty, pretty.\nAmy: Good news: the wildebeest is in the curry.\nPenny: The what?\nAmy: Bernadette is with Priya and Leonard. Message received. Commence operation \xe2\x80\x9cPriya Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t Wanna Be-ya.\xe2\x80\x9d\nPenny: Hey. Seriously? Didn\xe2\x80\x99t you get enough of this cliquey crap in high school?\nAmy: I wish. A clique requires friends. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t have any.\nPenny: None?\nAmy: I used to take my lunch down to the maintenance room and eat with the janitor. It was nice until his wife called me a puta and made me stop. Hang on. It\xe2\x80\x99s the wildebeest. Priya just made a snide comment about your acting career.\nPenny: Wh\xe2\x80\xa6 What the hell did she say?\nAmy: She thinks it\xe2\x80\x99s cool you\xe2\x80\x99re following your dream, no matter what.\nPenny: That bitch!\nAmy: How do you want to handle it?\nPenny: Um, okay. Tell Bernadette to tell Priya that I\xe2\x80\x99m on my way to Prague to shoot a movie with Angelina Jolie.\nAmy: Got it. Is it going to be in 3-D?\nPenny: What? I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter.\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna say 3-D. That\xe2\x80\x99ll let her know the studio has faith in it.\nScene: Raj\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nLeonard: You\xe2\x80\x99re kidding. 3-D?\nBernadette: That\xe2\x80\x99s what I hear.\nHoward: Then the studio must have real faith in it.\nLeonard: Wonder why she didn\xe2\x80\x99t tell me.\nPriya: Have you been spending time with your ex-girlfriend?\nLeonard: No.\nPriya: Then why are you surprised she didn\xe2\x80\x99t tell you?\nLeonard: Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s not as much surprised as, uh, uh, you know, uh. th-th-th-the other thing.\nPriya: What other thing?\nLeonard: Well, you know, if you, if, if, if you, uh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t, oh, what\xe2\x80\x99s the word I\xe2\x80\x99m looking for?\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to help you. This is hilarious.\nBernadette: She\xe2\x80\x99s also dating an astronaut.\nPriya: Wow. That\xe2\x80\x99s very impressive.\nBernadette: Yeah. But Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s impressive, too.\nLeonard: Thank you. Befuddled. The word I was looking for was befuddled.\nScene: The apartment. Sheldon is playing three person chess by himself.\nSheldon: Knight to old woman six-and-a-third. Brilliant move. Thank you. (Knock on door) Will the two of you excuse me?\nRaj: I need a hug.\nSheldon: Sorry, I have company.\nRaj: Come on, Sheldon, open the door.\nSheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to hug you.\nRaj: I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to hug you, either. I was just feeling blue.\nSheldon: Blue, as in depressed.\nRaj: Well, not so much depressed as lonely.\nSheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what colour lonely is.\nRaj: What?\nSheldon: Red is angry, yellow is frightened, green is jealous and blue is depressed. Perhaps we can assign a colour to lonely.\nRaj: Nothing rhymes with orange. It\xe2\x80\x99s probably lonely.\nSheldon: All right. Come in. You look positively orange with loneliness. No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t see that catching on at all.\nRaj: What are you doing?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m working on my three-person chess game.\nRaj: Oh, cool. Can I play?\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s three-person chess. Did you bring a friend?\nRaj: No.\nSheldon: Then as a mental exercise I invite you to figure out why the two of us can\xe2\x80\x99t play three-person chess. Can you believe this guy? Social protocol does, however, require me to bring you a hot beverage in your time of need.\nRaj: No, thank you. I\xe2\x80\x99m fine.\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s not optional. We\xe2\x80\x99re out of tea. I hope you like bouillon.\nRaj: I, uh, I guess you\xe2\x80\x99re probably wondering what\xe2\x80\x99s got me down.\nSheldon: Actually, I was wondering if I could add a third new chess piece. How do you think people would feel about Prince Joey, the king\xe2\x80\x99s feeble-minded but well-meaning cousin?\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99m going to be 30 years old, and I have no one in my life to love me. I\xe2\x80\x99m such a basket case, I can\xe2\x80\x99t even talk to a woman without having alcohol in my body.\nSheldon: The fun thing about Prince Joey is every time he moves, there\xe2\x80\x99s a one-in-five chance he\xe2\x80\x99ll kill himself.\nRaj: Sheldon, listen to me. I have a big decision to make, and I\xe2\x80\x99m scared.\nSheldon: Yellow. Go ahead.\nRaj: A friend at the School of Pharmacology gave me these new pills they\xe2\x80\x99re testing. He says it\xe2\x80\x99s the next big thing for social anxiety disorder.\nSheldon: Fascinating. What\xe2\x80\x99s in it?\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure. Some sort of beta-blocker attached to a molecule extracted from the urine of cows.\nSheldon: I like cows.\nRaj: That\xe2\x80\x99s not the point.\nSheldon: It was its own point. Go on.\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99m a scientist. My ability to think is my bread and butter. I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid if I take this, I might lose that special, unique something that makes me so successful in my field.\nSheldon: Rajesh, I\xe2\x80\x99ve had the privilege of working alongside you for many years. My recommendation is that you gobble these up like Tic Tacs.\nScene: Raj\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nHoward: Okay, I\xe2\x80\x99m still trying to work this out. How did Penny meet an astronaut?\nBernadette: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. The regular way people meet astronauts.\nHoward: Most of those guys live in Texas.\nBernadette: Obviously, this one doesn\xe2\x80\x99t.\nHoward: Okay.\nBernadette: Leonard lives here. Priya\xe2\x80\x99s from India. People meet, Howard. God!\nHoward: Fine.\nBernadette: You\xe2\x80\x99ve met lots of astronauts, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve never grilled you about that. I\xe2\x80\x99d thank you to extend me the same courtesy.\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m not grilling you, I was just curious.\nLeonard: I still can\xe2\x80\x99t get over the fact that she got a big movie part. Not that I care what my ex-girlfriend\xe2\x80\x99s up to, \xe2\x80\x99cause I don\xe2\x80\x99t.\nBernadette: Maybe that\xe2\x80\x99s where she met the astronaut, all right?\nPriya: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. What would an astronaut be doing working on a movie?\nBernadette: He\xe2\x80\x99s a consultant.\nLeonard: I thought the movie was about 18th-century Vienna?\nBernadette: He can\xe2\x80\x99t have a hobby? Excuse me, I have to pee. Or is that implausible, as well?\nHoward: It\xe2\x80\x99s nice to have another couple to hang with, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nPenny (to the shoes): All right, guys, you have to go back. I can\xe2\x80\x99t afford you. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, don\xe2\x80\x99t send\nus away, we love you.\xe2\x80\x9d I love you, too, but you cost more than my rent. \xe2\x80\x9cBut, Penny, you look so good in us.\xe2\x80\x9d Damn it, the shoes are right.\nAmy: Good golly, Penny, your whimsy is boundless. (Phone rings) What do you got for me, wildebeest?\nBernadette (in Raj\xe2\x80\x99s bathroom): I think they\xe2\x80\x99re on to me. The story\xe2\x80\x99s starting to fall apart.\nAmy: Calm down. Everything\xe2\x80\x99s going to be okay. (To Penny) We may have to kill her. Bernadette, I\xe2\x80\x99m putting you on speakerphone. Where are you now?\nBernadette: In the bathroom.\nAmy: Oh, look at this, another one of our classic bathroom gabfests. What\xe2\x80\x99s the problem?\nBernadette: They\xe2\x80\x99re just asking me all sorts of questions I can\xe2\x80\x99t answer.\nAmy: Just change the subject.\nBernadette: I suppose I could get them back to talking about Leonard going to India to meet Priya\xe2\x80\x99s parents.\nPenny: What?\nBernadette: They said something about going there this summer.\nPenny: What, are they getting engaged?\nBernadette: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I was too busy covering my heinie on Amy\xe2\x80\x99s stupid astronaut story!\nAmy: What astronaut story?\nBernadette: You texted me Penny\xe2\x80\x99s dating an astronaut.\nAmy: I texted architect. That\xe2\x80\x99s amusing. Auto-correct must\xe2\x80\x99ve changed it.\nBernadette: Yeah, it\xe2\x80\x99s hysterical.\nPenny: All right, look, just forget about the astronaut.\nAmy: Architect. Where would you have met an astronaut?\nPenny: Look, just find out what\xe2\x80\x99s up with this trip to India.\nBernadette: I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to do this anymore!\nPenny: Don\xe2\x80\x99t you quit on us!\nHoward (knocking on bathroom door): Bernie, you okay?\nBernadette (screaming): It was an architect!\nScene: A coffee shop.\nRaj: Thank you for coming with me, Sheldon. You\xe2\x80\x99re a good friend.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m glad you think so. That\xe2\x80\x99s what I strive to emulate.\nRaj: Okay, let\xe2\x80\x99s see if this drug works.\nWoman at table: Can I help you?\nRaj: Forgive me for staring, but you\xe2\x80\x99re very beautiful.\nWoman: Thank you. That\xe2\x80\x99s a great accent. Where are you from?\nRaj: India.\nWoman: Oh, cool. I\xe2\x80\x99ve always wanted to go there.\nRaj: It\xe2\x80\x99s a beautiful country. You\xe2\x80\x99d love it. May I join you?\nWoman: Uh, okay, sure. Why not?\nRaj: My name is Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali, and this is my friend Dr. Sheldon Cooper.\nWoman: Hi.\nSheldon: Oh, there\xe2\x80\x99s no need to interact with me. I\xe2\x80\x99m just here to observe.\nWoman: What\xe2\x80\x99s he observing?\nRaj: We\xe2\x80\x99re scientists. We observe everything. Here, go buy yourself a scone.\nSheldon: All right.\nRaj: And what is your name?\nWoman: Angela.\nRaj: Oh, derived from the word angel. Appropriate.\nAngela: You\xe2\x80\x99re cute.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99d like to buy a scone.\nServer: Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, we\xe2\x80\x99re out. We have muffins.\nSheldon: They sound delicious, but this money is earmarked for scones.\nAngela: What are you doing?\nRaj (taking his shirt off): Oh, just getting comfortable. So how long have you lived in Los Angeles?\nAngela: I\xe2\x80\xa6\nSheldon: They were out of scones.\nRaj (removing his trousers): Sheldon, I\xe2\x80\x99m talking to someone. You\xe2\x80\x99re being rude. I\xe2\x80\x99ll bet you\xe2\x80\x99re an actress. If not, you should be. You have a very expressive face.\nAngela: Oh, my God.\nRaj: Wait, where are you going? We were doing so well. She never even got to see my penis. Ta-da!\nScene: Raj\xe2\x80\x99s apartment. They are playing Jenga,\nPriya: Who wants some more coffee?\nLeonard: Thanks, yeah.\nHoward: Sure.\nBernadette: Let me help you.\nHoward: Nice to see that the gals are getting along.\nLeonard: Gals? Who are you, Fred Flintstone?\nBernadette: This trip to India sounds fun.\nPriya: Yeah, I think it will be.\nBernadette: Are you concerned your parents might not approve of Leonard?\nPriya: A little. They\xe2\x80\x99re very old-fashioned.\nBernadette: Well, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t worry about it. It\xe2\x80\x99s not like you guys are getting engaged, right?\nPriya: Oh, God, no. We\xe2\x80\x99re not there yet.\nBernadette: Not engaged. Very interesting. I have to tinkle.\nPriya: You\xe2\x80\x99ve been in there a lot tonight. Are you okay?\nBernadette: Yes. Are you writing a book?\nPriya: Why are you getting upset?\nBernadette: I\xe2\x80\x99m not upset. Maybe you\xe2\x80\x99re upset.\nPriya: What\xe2\x80\x99s up with you? Bernadette?\nBernadette: I can\xe2\x80\x99t do this anymore! I\xe2\x80\x99m a good girl! I went to Catholic school! (Storms out,)\nHoward: Okay, well, it\xe2\x80\x99s getting late. This was terrific. You win. Bernie?\nLeonard: I think the word you\xe2\x80\x99re looking for is befuddled.\nScene: The apartment. Sheldon, Leonard and Howard are playing three person chess.\nSheldon: My catapult flings my bishop to Howard\xe2\x80\x99s Queen\xe2\x80\x99s Gorilla two.\nHoward: Nice. Okay, rook to transporter pad. And he comes out at Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s Queen\xe2\x80\x99s Bishop\nfive-and-a-third. Check on Leonard.\nLeonard: Hang on. When is my pawn allowed to use the golf cart?\nSheldon: When it\xe2\x80\x99s done charging. Or you land on the time machine. Obviously.\nLeonard: Oh, oh, Beekeeper to King 12. I capture your Pope and release the swarm. Checkmate on Sheldon.\nSheldon: I knew I should have given my Pope the jet pack.\nRaj (still naked): Hey, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got winners.\n\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
