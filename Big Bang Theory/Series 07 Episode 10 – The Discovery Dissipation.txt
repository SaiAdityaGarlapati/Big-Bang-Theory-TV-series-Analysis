b'Scene: A radio studio.\nIra Flatow: This is Science Friday. I\xe2\x80\x99m Ira Flatow. My guest today is responsible for the discovery of the first stable super-heavy element. Welcome, Dr. Sheldon Cooper.\nSheldon: Thank you. Uh, the university made me come here. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to. Uh, big fan of the show.\nIra: So, I understand that you actually discovered this element by mistake.\nSheldon: Yes.\nIra: And some people in the science community are calling it The Wonder Blunder.\nSheldon: Who? Give me their names. I bet it\xe2\x80\x99s Wolowitz.\nIra: It\xe2\x80\x99s just such a fascinating story. Your calculations are way off, but they find the element anyway. It\xe2\x80\x99s like misreading a treasure map and still finding the treasure.\nSheldon: Can we talk about something else? Do you know that I yodel?\nIra: That\xe2\x80\x99s interesting, but this could be taking you down the path toward a Nobel Prize. And in chemistry, no less. And wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t that be unusual? Because you\xe2\x80\x99re a physicist.\nSheldon: Yes, yes, I\xe2\x80\x99d be a physicist with a Nobel in chemistry. Everyone laugh at the circus freak. You know, I don\xe2\x80\x99t need to sit here and take this, Flatow. It is because of bullies like you, every day more and more Americans are making the switch to television.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The apartment. Sheldon is on the phone.\nSheldon: President Seibert, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why you\xe2\x80\x99re yelling. You\xe2\x80\x99re the one who made me go on the radio. I was expecting a professional science interview, not an attack by some morning zoo shock jock. Well, if the university needs money so badly, perhaps you should start a swear jar. Whoa, that one\xe2\x80\x99s worth a dollar.\nAmy: I know you don\xe2\x80\x99t like it, but every time you do an interview, it raises the profile of the university. That translates to funding.\nSheldon: Yeah, well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not just some trained monkey dancing for coins.\nLeonard: Of course you\xe2\x80\x99re not. People love trained monkeys.\nPenny: How can you not be happy? You\xe2\x80\x99re tall, thin and famous. Oh, my God, I\xe2\x80\x99m jealous of Sheldon.\nSheldon: Look, you\xe2\x80\x99re gonna be doing this stuff for a while. You\xe2\x80\x99re just gonna have to find a way to get used to it.\nSheldon: But none of you know what this is like. Being celebrated for something you wish you never did.\nPenny: Mmm, you clearly haven\xe2\x80\x99t been with me at Mardi Gras.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nBernadette: Want to pause the video game and help me clean up?\nHoward: I am cleaning up. Look at the mess the Joker made of Gotham City.\nBernadette: Come on, it\xe2\x80\x99s your friend who\xe2\x80\x99s coming to stay here.\nHoward: Raj grew up in India. Trust me, he\xe2\x80\x99s seen worse.\nBernadette: Howie.\nHoward: I promise I\xe2\x80\x99ll help out the rest of the week.\nBernadette: The rest of the week? You said it was just gonna be a night or two.\nHoward: Yeah, but if I told you a week, would you have said yes?\nBernadette: No.\nHoward: Then you left me no choice.\nBernadette: I love Raj, but that\xe2\x80\x99s a long time for a house guest.\nHoward: I know, but they\xe2\x80\x99re tenting his building. He can\xe2\x80\x99t find a hotel he likes that allows dogs.\nBernadette: He\xe2\x80\x99s bringing Cinnamon?\nHoward: For a whole week, the nerve of some people.\nScene: Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom. Sheldon is playing with his train set.\nSheldon: Here comes the Embarrassment Express. With stops at Fraudville, Wonder Blunderberg, and Kansas City. Because it\xe2\x80\x99s a hub.\nAmy: Sheldon, can I come in?\nSheldon: Do you have cookies?\nAmy: No.\nSheldon: Good. I don\xe2\x80\x99t deserve cookies. Come in. Wil?\nWil Wheaton: Hey, Sheldon. It\xe2\x80\x99s been a while.\nSheldon: Why are you here?\nWil: Amy said you were having a rough time, and I thought maybe we could talk. Is that okay?\nSheldon: Certainly. Although, right now, I\xe2\x80\x99m having a rough time because there\xe2\x80\x99s three people in my room, and it\xe2\x80\x99s starting to feel like a discotheque.\nAmy: Sheldon, you said you were unhappy getting attention for something you wished you never did.\nWil: Yeah, I know a little something about that.\nSheldon: Oh, nonsense, Wil. Your endless tweets are not that bad.\nWil: I remember why it\xe2\x80\x99s been a while. Sheldon, I was actually talking about when I was a kid on Star Trek.\nSheldon: How could you not like getting attention for playing Wesley Crusher? You were wonderful. A know-it-all boy genius with an eidetic memory. Who couldn\xe2\x80\x99t relate to that?\nWil: Well, not everybody felt that way. A lot of people really hated the character, and some of them hated me because of it. I would do interviews, and people would be mean to me.\nSheldon: That just happened to me. Next time you\xe2\x80\x99re stuck for a tweet, feel free to say what a jerk Ira Flatow is.\nAmy: Sheldon, the point is Wil learned to embrace that part of his life and moved on to bigger and better things.\nWil: Yeah, I\xe2\x80\x99m an author now, I do public speaking, and I have my own Web series about board games.\nAmy: Uh, we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to cheer him up, so\xe2\x80\xa6\nWil: I\xe2\x80\x99m just saying that there was a time when I thought I would never get out of Wesley Crusher\xe2\x80\x99s shadow. But now, it\xe2\x80\x99s just one small part of a pretty great life, and it\xe2\x80\x99s a part that I\xe2\x80\x99m happy is there.\nSheldon: I do see what you\xe2\x80\x99re saying. That helps.\nWil: Good.\nSheldon: Would you two like to stay and play trains with me?\nWil: Sure.\nAmy: Okay.\nSheldon: Oh, great, now, I work the controls, I say all aboard. You sit quietly and watch.\nWil:Can I blow the whistle?\nSheldon: You should probably go.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nHoward: You\xe2\x80\x99re gonna brush your teeth on my couch?\nRaj: No, I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna brush Cinnamon\xe2\x80\x99s teeth.\nHoward: Why bother? She spends half the time licking her butt.\nRaj: And the other half licking my face. That\xe2\x80\x99s why I\xe2\x80\x99m brushing her teeth.\nBernadette: Hey, guys. Sorry I\xe2\x80\x99m so late. Did you already have dinner?\nHoward: No, we were waiting for you.\nBernadette: Aw, that\xe2\x80\x99s so sweet.\nHoward: Yeah. So what do you feel like making?\nRaj: Howard, the poor thing just got home from work. Let me get you a glass of wine. I\xe2\x80\x99ll cook dinner.\nBermadette: Oh, Raj, you\xe2\x80\x99re our guest.\nRaj: Don\xe2\x80\x99t be silly. Sit. You look like you\xe2\x80\x99ve had a long day.\nHoward: No, she always looks like that. Because she married an idiot.\nBernadette: Thank you, Raj.\nRaj: Please, this is my way of thanking you for letting me stay here. Now, tell us all about your day.\nBernadette: Okay, um, well, first, I was late to a meeting \xe2\x80\x99cause I was stuck in traffic.\nHoward: Well, I keep telling you to put that traffic app on your phone.\nRaj: Hey, when you got home today complaining that you felt sick from eating too many jelly beans, did I tell you how to fix it? No. I said, aw, that must hurt, and I rubbed your belly.\nHoward: I thought of you the whole time.\nRaj: All I\xe2\x80\x99m saying is there\xe2\x80\x99s a time to just listen.\nBernadette: Thank you.\nRaj: There\xe2\x80\x99s also a time to stop eating too many jelly beans. And it\xe2\x80\x99s when you\xe2\x80\x99re ten.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Hello, President Siebert. Thank you for taking my call. I just wanted you to know that you can now expect enthusiastic participation from me regarding my discovery. Oh, no, no, no, no. No need to thank mNo, thank my friend, Wil Wheaton. For your information, I have nine friends, hmm? Ten if we include you. Nine it is. Ah, it\xe2\x80\x99s ten. I\xe2\x80\x99ll count Wolowitz. Hello, friend Leonard.\nLeonard: Hey, you\xe2\x80\x99re in a good mood.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m in a great mood.\nLeonard: Well, you\xe2\x80\x99re about to be in an even better one. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to say anything until I knew for sure, but, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been re-running the tests on your element in my lab and I disproved it. Your element does not exist.\nSheldon: Yeah, but what about the Chinese research team? They found it.\nLeonard: Yeah, it turns out someone added simulated signals to the data files. They faked the results.\nSheldon: Really?\nLeonard: Yes. Do you know what that means? That means all of this attention that you hate goes away.\nSheldon: So no more interviews?\nLeonard: No, it\xe2\x80\x99s all over.\nSheldon: I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe it.\nLeonard: Well, you\xe2\x80\x99re welcome.\nSheldon: You robbed me of my greatest achievement.\nLeonard: What?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m back down to nine friends. Make it eight, I\xe2\x80\x99m sick of Wolowitz, too.\nLeonard: I, I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand. All you\xe2\x80\x99ve done since you discovered this stupid element was complain. I was trying to make you happy.\nSheldon: By taking away my only claim to fame? Well, if you wanted to make me happy, you could have told me a joke. Or shown me a cute video of a koala and an otter becoming unlikely friends.\nLeonard: Oh, there is no winning with you. And koalas and otters don\xe2\x80\x99t even live near each other.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s what makes their friendship unlikely,\nPenny: Hey, what\xe2\x80\x99s with all the yelling?\nSheldon: Leonard disproved my element. Now all the attention is going to go away.\nPenny: Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s great. You must be thrilled,\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s it, I\xe2\x80\x99m down to seven friends.\nPenny: He\xe2\x80\x99s counting hobbits and superheroes, right?\nSheldon: When I thought the element was real, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want it. But now that Leonard made it not exist, I want it more than anything in the world.\nLeonard: The, the element never existed. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t take it away, science took it away. Be mad at science.\nSheldon: Don\xe2\x80\x99t you dare use science against me. Science is my best friend. Oh, good, I\xe2\x80\x99m back up to eight.\nLeonard: Will you tell him he\xe2\x80\x99s out of his mind.\nPenny: Actually, I get what he\xe2\x80\x99s saying.\nSheldon: Oh, yes, nine. Welcome back, buddy.\nPenny: It\xe2\x80\x99s like if you\xe2\x80\x99re dating someone you\xe2\x80\x99re not that into, and then they break up with you and then you want them more than ever.\nSheldon: I have no idea what she\xe2\x80\x99s talking about, but we\xe2\x80\x99re ganging up on you so I agree.\nLeonard: Okay, Sheldon, what do you want me to do, hide the information? If I don\xe2\x80\x99t publish it, it\xe2\x80\x99s just a matter of time before someone else does.\nSheldon: No, no, of course you have to publish. That\xe2\x80\x99s your responsibility as a scientist. Doing otherwise would be unethical. You have no choice.\nLeonard: Fine, I\xe2\x80\x99ll publish.\nSheldon: Can you believe this guy?\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nBernadette: Aw! Raj did the dishes.\nHoward: How do you know I didn\xe2\x80\x99t do them?\nBernadette: Because once, when all the knives were dirty, you cut a bagel with your keys.\nRaj: Good morning, everybody. I picked up coffee while I was out. Bernadette, here\xe2\x80\x99s your soy peppermint mocha.\nBernadette: Aw, you didn\xe2\x80\x99t have to do that.\nRaj: Oh, my pleasure, and don\xe2\x80\x99t worry about your presentation today. You\xe2\x80\x99re gonna be great.\nHoward: Yeah, you\xe2\x80\x99re gonna knock it out of the park.\nBernadette: What presentation do I have today?\nHoward: Just go.\nRaj: He loves you.\nHoward: What are you doing? Are you trying to make me look bad?\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99m just being a good house guest.\nHoward: No, you\xe2\x80\x99re being a better husband than I am. Doing the dishes, getting coffee, knowing about her life, who does that?\nRaj: Oh, come on, I brought you one, too.\nHoward: I don\xe2\x80\x99t want coffee.\nRaj: That\xe2\x80\x99s why I got you hot chocolate.\nHoward: Give me that. Just stop showing me up.\nRaj: Howard, listen to me. You\xe2\x80\x99re a great husband. Yes, your listening skills could use some work. But it\xe2\x80\x99s amazing how far you\xe2\x80\x99ve come given that you\xe2\x80\x99re an only child raised by an over-protective mom.\nHoward: Um, is this getting weird?\nRaj: Hang on.\nHoward: So, yes.\nScene: Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s office.\nLeonard: Hey. I just wanted to let you know that I, I posted my findings.\nSheldon: I saw. And I just posted a retraction of my paper. Now the whole scientific community knows I was wrong.\nLeonard: These things happen all the time, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Not to me. The only other retraction I ever had to issue was when I was seven and I conceded that my brother was the greatest ninja in East Texas. But that was just a ploy to get my face out of his armpit.\nBarry: Thew he is. It\xe2\x80\x99s my favowite superhewo, the Wetwactor.\nLeonard: Come on, don\xe2\x80\x99t give him a hard time.\nBarry: I\xe2\x80\x99m sowwy, Cooper. I wetwact it. By the way, Hofstadter, nice job dispwoving the Chinese team.\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s not a big deal.\nBarry: It\xe2\x80\x99s a huge deal. Cooper, maybe physics just isn\xe2\x80\x99t your thing. Have you ever considered a caweer in wetail? That way you could take things back for a wiving.\nLeonard: Okay, Barry, that\xe2\x80\x99s enough.\nSheldon: No, no, no, that\xe2\x80\x99s okay. I can fight my own battles. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that right, Bawwy.\nBarry: Is? Is that a wefewence to my speech impediment? That\xe2\x80\x99s pwetty hurtful. I, I can\xe2\x80\x99t contwol it.\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re right, That was uncalled for. I take it back.\nBarry: Of course you do. Because you\xe2\x80\x99re the Wetwactor.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nBernadette: Raj, this dinner was amazing. If you\xe2\x80\x99re here much longer, I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna have to buy bigger clothes.\nRaj: Nonsense. You need a little fattening up. You\xe2\x80\x99ve been looking too skinny lately.\nBernadette: Aw. Howie, how come you never say anything sweet like that?\nHoward: What are you talking about? Remember last week, when I asked you if you were wearing Spanx and you weren\xe2\x80\x99t? How\xe2\x80\x99s that different?\nBernadette: Maybe you could try being more thoughtful, like your friend Raj.\nHoward: Yeah, well, maybe you could try being more like Raj.\nBernadette: Oh, really?\nHoward: Yeah, yeah. He packed me a lunch this morning. And there was a note inside that said go get \xe2\x80\x99em.\nBernadette: Like I don\xe2\x80\x99t do enough around here. Now I need to pack your lunch? And by the way, why do you need a note telling you to go get \xe2\x80\x99em? You\xe2\x80\x99re a grown man, you should know to go get \xe2\x80\x99em.\nHoward: I do know to go get \xe2\x80\x99em, but sometimes it\xe2\x80\x99s nice to have emotional support when I\xe2\x80\x99m going and getting them.\nRaj: Hey, hey, do you hear yourselves? Let\xe2\x80\x99s just, you know, all calm down and take a step back.\nBernadette: This is stupid. Why are we fighting?\nHoward: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I guess I was just feeling like I\xe2\x80\x99m a lousy husband.\nBernadette: You\xe2\x80\x99re not a lousy husband. You\xe2\x80\x99re a great husband. I was the one feeling like a lousy wife.\nHoward: Are you kidding? You\xe2\x80\x99re the best. I know what the problem is. It\xe2\x80\x99s him.\nRaj: Oh, what did I do?\nHoward: You made us feel like we\xe2\x80\x99re not trying hard enough.\nBernadette: Yeah, we were totally fine half-assing our marriage till you showed up.\nRaj: Look, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry you\xe2\x80\x99re upset with me, but I just have to say it\xe2\x80\x99s nice to see the two of you on the same page.\nHoward: Oh, it does feel good to have you backing me up for once.\nBernadette: I back you up all the time.\nHoward: That is not\xe2\x80\xa6 he\xe2\x80\x99s doing it again.\nBernadette: What is wrong with you?\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe they kicked you out.\nRaj: I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe they\xe2\x80\x99re still married. Oh, no, I forgot Cinnamon\xe2\x80\x99s toothbrush at Howard\xe2\x80\x99s. I guess you\xe2\x80\x99re sharing with Daddy again.\nPenny: Bark once if you need me to call PETA.\nSheldon: What\xe2\x80\x99s that animal doing in our apartment?\nLeonard: Oh, relax, she\xe2\x80\x99s in her crate. She can\xe2\x80\x99t get out.\nSheldon: I have two words for you, Jurassic Park. This day just keeps getting worse and worse.\nPenny: You know, if it makes you feel any better\xe2\x80\xa6\nSheldon: It probably won\xe2\x80\x99t.\nPenny: You\xe2\x80\x99re probably right.\nAmy: Sheldon, it\xe2\x80\x99s a beautiful night. Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you and I go for a nice walk together?\nSheldon: Oh, everything is just sex with you isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\nRaj: Sheldon, I think you might find the support you\xe2\x80\x99re looking for if you realize that relationships are a give and take. She can only be there for you as much as you are for her.\nAmy: Thank you, Rajesh.\nRaj: And, Amy, you need to be patient with Sheldon, instead of pressuring him to accept intimacy on your terms.\nAmy: You should probably go.\nScene: The radio studio.\nIra: I\xe2\x80\x99m Ira Flatow, and this is Science Friday. I\xe2\x80\x99d like to welcome back Dr. Sheldon Cooper, who thought he had discovered a new super-heavy element only to have it disproved by my next guest, Dr. Leonard Hofstadter. Welcome to Science< Friday, gentlemen.\nLeonard: Thanks.\nSheldon: Thank you. Ira, if I may, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to apologize for my behaviour last week.\nIra: It\xe2\x80\x99s all right.\nSheldon: Now, isn\xe2\x80\x99t there something you\xe2\x80\x99d like to say to me?\nIra: No. Now, Dr. Hofstadter. Can you walk us through the process you used to disprove his theory?\nLeonard: Well\xe2\x80\xa6\nSheldon: I believe I can answer that.\nLeonard: He asked me.\nSheldon: Fine.\nLeonard: As I was saying\xe2\x80\xa6\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re telling it wrong. Ira, to really understand the story here, you have to start at the very beginning. A small town in East Texas, where a young genius named\xe2\x80\xa6\nLeonard: Sheldon.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s right, Sheldon Cooper. He was bitten by his neighbour\xe2\x80\x99s dog, leading to his first scientific breakthrough, the doggie death-ray. Which, sadly, he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t build because Santa wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t bring him enriched uranium.\nIra: You know, I\xe2\x80\x99d really like to hear it from Dr. Hofstadter, if it\xe2\x80\x99s okay with you.\nSheldon: What a surprise. Did you invite me back just so you could ignore me?\nIra: Actually, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t invite you. You came in, you took a seat, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not comfortable with confrontation.\nLeonard: Sheldon, this interview is supposed to be about me.\nSheldon: Well, that seems like a snooze. Even for public radio.\nPenny (listening in her apartment): You know, if we did a shot every time they said something embarrassing, this would be one hell of a drinking game.\nAmy: A little early for alcohol, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\nSheldon: You know, I don\xe2\x80\x99t just say smart things about science. I also yodel. (Does)\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99ll get the vodka.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
