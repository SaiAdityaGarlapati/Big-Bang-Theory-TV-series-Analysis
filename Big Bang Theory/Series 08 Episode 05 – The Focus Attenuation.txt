b'Scene: The cafeteria.\nRaj: Hey, I read that someone invented a way to convert your footsteps into electromagnetic energy so you can charge your cell phone while walking.\nLeonard: We had that idea years ago. How come we never did anything with it?\nHoward: Probably because we left the diagram of it in the restaurant, and none of us wanted to walk back.\nSheldon: I know the real reason you never made progress with that idea. You thought of it September 22nd, 2007. Two days later, Penny moved in, and so much blood rushed to your genitals, your brain became a ghost town.\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99s not what happened.\nSheldon: I remember it distinctly because I had just composed my annual poem commemorating the anniversary of Dr. Seuss\xe2\x80\x99s death.\nHoward: No one wants to hear it.\nSheldon: Why, die. Why did he die? Old, told. I was told he was old.\nLeonard: Penny is not the reason I didn\xe2\x80\x99t pursue that idea.\nSheldon: Oh, really? Since meeting her, what have been your greatest accomplishments?\nRaj: Easy. Sleeping with Penny.\nHoward: Getting Penny to go back out with him after she dumped him.\nRaj: Tricking Penny into getting engaged.\nHoward: And a few weeks ago, he almost did a pull-up.\nLeonard: I think someone owes me an apology.\nSheldon: Well, don\xe2\x80\x99t feel bad. I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve all been distracted since the girls entered our lives.\nHoward: You admit Amy\xe2\x80\x99s a distraction?\nSheldon: Oh, very much so. Listen to this. This is from two days ago. Hi. Hope you\xe2\x80\x99re having a good day. Who has time for this constant sexting?\nLeonard: Well, maybe we have lost our focus.\nHoward: It wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t kill us to get together and brainstorm ideas.\nRaj: Ooh, we could have one of those retreats.\nLeonardLike our own science retreat.\nHoward: My cousin has a cabin out in the woods.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to a cabin in the woods. Did you see the movie Cabin in the Woods?\nLeonard: Then we\xe2\x80\x99ll go to a hotel.\nSheldon: A hotel? Did you see The Shining?\nRaj: We could go up to Big Bear and get a house on the lake.\nSheldon: Did you see The Lake House?\nRaj: Nothing bad happens in The Lake House.\nSheldon: Yeah, well, no, not to them. To me. Time traveling mailbox. The only time that traveled was an hour and half of my life down the toilet.\nLeonard: Fine. Then we\xe2\x80\x99ll just stay here and do it.\nSheldon: Well, you didn\xe2\x80\x99t suggest a beach house.\nLeonard: You would go to a beach house?\nSheldon: Well, good Lord, no, have you seen Jaws?\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nPenny: Hey.\nLeonard: Hey. So, the guys and I are talking about having kind of a science retreat this weekend. I just wanted to know if that\xe2\x80\x99s okay. You and I had talked about going to brunch on Sunday.\nPenny: Want to go to Vegas this weekend?\nAmy: Of course I do.\nPenny: Bernadette? Girl\xe2\x80\x99s weekend. Vegas. You in?\nBernadette: Hell, yeah.\nPenny: Yes. I\xe2\x80\x99ll check flights.\nBernadette: I\xe2\x80\x99ll check hotels.\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99ll check my underpants. I\xe2\x80\x99m so excited, I think I peed.\nLeonard: They seem okay with it.\nScene: The apartment.\nRaj: Hey.\nLeonard: Hey.\nHoward: Hey. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t think you\xe2\x80\x99d make it.\nRaj: Why not?\nHoward: Well, \xe2\x80\x99cause you have a steady girlfriend now, and we assumed you\xe2\x80\x99d have to stay home to lower the food down to her in the pit.\nRaj: For your information, Emily is working tonight.\nSheldon: Yeah, one would assume, on getting out of the pit.\nLeonard: Okay, let\xe2\x80\x99s focus. The girls are gone, we have 48 hours. There are no distractions. Let\xe2\x80\x99s change the world.\nSheldon: Thinking caps on.\nHoward: Here we go.\nRaj: Ooh, this is exciting. We\xe2\x80\x99re innovating. I feel like we\xe2\x80\x99re in the Facebook movie.\nHoward: Oh. I never saw that.\nSheldon: Really?\nRaj: Oh. It\xe2\x80\x99s wonderful, and I swear I\xe2\x80\x99m not saying that because Justin Timberlake is in it.\nSheldon: Yeah, I have it on Blu-ray. We should watch it.\nRaj: Cool. I\xe2\x80\x99ll make the popcorn.\nLeonard: Guys, in 30 seconds, we went from let\xe2\x80\x99s change the world to let\xe2\x80\x99s watch TV.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. Is that a no?\nHoward: Okay. No. Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s right. We\xe2\x80\x99re here to focus. Didn\xe2\x80\x99t we used to have a list of all our ideas?\nLeonard: I, I think I still have it.\nSheldon: I did not get a clear answer. I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna set this down now.\nLeonard: Ah, here it is. Whoa. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t looked at these in years. Robot girlfriend.\nHoward: Mm, that was mine.\nLeonard: Robot prostitute.\nHoward: Also mine.\nSheldon: Wait. I\xe2\x80\x99m confused. Why would you need both a robot girlfriend and a robot prostitute?\nHoward: There\xe2\x80\x99s just some things you don\xe2\x80\x99t do with your robot girlfriend.\nRaj: Boy, when you met Bernadette, the field of robotics really took a hit.\nLeonard: Okay, let\xe2\x80\x99s just skip all the inventions you can have sex with. All right, no, here we go, ergonomic heated seat cushion.\nHoward: No, it vibrates. Keep going.\nLeonard: You know, let\xe2\x80\x99s just come up with something new.\nSheldon: You know, a number of significant innovations have been inspired by science fiction. The, the geosynchronous satellite from Arthur C. Clarke. The Motorola flip phone, that came from Star Trek. And I\xe2\x80\x99ve long suspected that the idea of an African-American president was stolen from the movie Deep Impact.\nRaj: Hey, the future they show in Back to the Future II is only a year away. A lot of the things in that movie haven\xe2\x80\x99t been invented yet.\nLeonard: How cool would that be if we could make one of those a reality?\nSheldon: If we could figure out the scientific basis for Marty\xe2\x80\x99s hover board, that would have universal application.\nLeonard: Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s, it\xe2\x80\x99s possible at absolute zero, but we would have to remove the temperature restrictions.\nRaj: Oh, I have an idea.\nSheldon: I think I have the same one.\nHoward: We got to watch Back to the Future II.\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99ll make the popcorn.\nScene: A Vegas hotel room.\nPenny: So, where should we go first?\nAmy: Ooh. There\xe2\x80\x99s a cover band in the lounge.\nPenny: Nah.\nAmy: But they play Barry Manilow.\nPenny: No.\nAmy: But they\xe2\x80\x99re called Fairly Manilow.\nPenny: Oh. Okay.\nAmy: Great.\nPenny: No.\nBernadette: Well, what do you want to do?\nPenny: Well, we\xe2\x80\x99re in Vegas. I want to go downstairs, get a bucket of margaritas, dance until I vomit all over a roulette wheel and watch it go everywhere.\nAmy: What if we don\xe2\x80\x99t want to vomit?\nPenny: Oh, you will. That\xe2\x80\x99s why they give you the bucket. Uh-oh.\nAmy: What?\nPenny: It\xe2\x80\x99s my boss. They moved my field ride up to Monday.\nAmy: What does that mean?\nPenny: It means instead of having a week to study, I only have two days.\nBernadette: That sucks.\nAmy: Can you start in the morning?\nPenny: Uh, it\xe2\x80\x99s kind of a lot. You know, let me do a little tonight, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll catch up with you guys later.\nBernadette: You sure?\nPenny: Yeah, it\xe2\x80\x99s okay. Go ahead.\nAmy: So, um, now that Penny\xe2\x80\x99s not coming\xe2\x80\xa6\nBernadette: We\xe2\x80\x99re not seeing Fairly Manilow.\nAmy: Okay.\nScene: The apartment.\nHoward: Hold on. Pause. Something doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make sense. Look, in 2015, Biff steals the sports almanac and takes the time machine back to 1955, to give it to his younger self. But as soon as he does that, he changes the future, so the 2015 he returns to would be a different 2015, not the 2015 that Marty and Doc were in.\nLeoanard: This is Hot Tub Time Machine all over again. If future Biff goes back to 2015 right after he gives young Biff the almanac, he could get back to the 2015 with Marty and Doc in it. Because it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t until his 21st birthday that 1955 Biff placed his first bet.\nSheldon: Wait. Whoa, whoa. Is placed right?\nLeonard: What do you mean?\nSheldon: Is placed the right tense for something that would have happened in the future of a past that was affected by something from the future?\nLeonard: Had will have placed?\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s my boy.\nLeonard: Okay, so, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t until his 21st birthday that Biff had will have placed his first bet and made his millions. That\xe2\x80\x99s when he altered the timeline.\nSheldon: Yeah, but he had will haven\xe2\x80\x99t placed it!\nHoward: What?\nSheldon: Unlike Hot Tub Time Machine, this couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be more simple. When Biff gets the almanac in 1955, the alternate future he creates isn\xe2\x80\x99t the one in which Marty and Doc Brown ever use the time machine to travel to 2015. Therefore, in the new timeline, Marty and Doc never brought the time machine\xe2\x80\xa6\nLeonard: Wait. Is brought right?\nSheldon: Marty and Doc never had have had brought?\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. You did it to me.\nSheldon: Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m going with it. Marty and Doc never had have had brought the time machine to 2015. That means 2015 Biff could also not had have had brought the almanac to 1955 Biff. Therefore, the timeline in which 1955 Biff gets the almanac is also the timeline in which 1955 Biff never gets the almanac. And not just never gets. Never have, never hasn\xe2\x80\x99t, never had have hasn\xe2\x80\x99t.\nRaj: He\xe2\x80\x99s right. Also, what kind of name is Biff? Sounds like when you pop open a can of Pillsbury dough. Biff.\nHoward: Oh, that stuff is so good wrapped around cocktail weenies.\nLeonard: Guys.\nSheldon: Do you know that the word wiener comes from the German name of the Austrian capital Vienna, or Wien?\nRaj: Do you know if you look at Austria on a map it actually looks like a wiener?\nLeonard: Guys, what are we doing? We sent the girls away so we could focus.\nSheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it worked.\nScene: A bar in Vegas.\nAmy: Maybe after this, you\xe2\x80\x99ll be in the mood for some Manilow.\nBernadette: I think after this, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be dead.\nAmy: Look at us out, while Penny\xe2\x80\x99s in the room studying.\nBernadette: I\xe2\x80\x99m proud of her. This is a great opportunity. It\xe2\x80\x99s nice to see her take it seriously.\nAmy: It is. But enough about Penny. Let\xe2\x80\x99s talk about us. We\xe2\x80\x99re looking good.\nBernadette: We are.\nAmy: Better than good. I mean, look at you. Your body\xe2\x80\x99s bangin\xe2\x80\x99.\nBernadette: Amy.\nAmy: Don\xe2\x80\x99t Amy me. We\xe2\x80\x99re always talking about how hot Penny is. Come on, scientist to scientist, how big are those Hadron Colliders?\nBernadette: You\xe2\x80\x99re embarrassing me.\nAmy: Oh, don\xe2\x80\x99t be embarrassed. I\xe2\x80\x99ll show you the divot in my spine.\nBernadette: What?\nAmy: No, no, it\xe2\x80\x99s okay. I was born with it. If you put a double-A battery in there, it makes my leg kick.\nScene: Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s laboratory.\nLeonard: All right.\nSheldon: Oh, this is already better. There are far fewer distractions in here.\nRaj: Plus, this is where our minds are conditioned to focus on work.\nLeonard: So, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been thinking about the hover boards, and maybe there\xe2\x80\x99s a way we could use Maglev technology.\nHoward: Or if we could figure out a way to supercool the materials, we could utilize quantum coupling.\nSheldon: Well, I wonder if anyone\xe2\x80\x99s tried that.\nRaj: Go online and look it up.\nShortly afterwards.\nHoward: Oh, I can\xe2\x80\x99t argue with him. It\xe2\x80\x99s right there on the screen. Austria does look like a wiener.\nRaj: That\xe2\x80\x99s nothing, dude. Go check out how hung Florida is.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m sure Mrs. Florida\xe2\x80\x99s walking funny. Can we get back to work?\nSheldon: Yeah, he\xe2\x80\x99s right. Oh, here\xe2\x80\x99s a thought. What if we use some form of operant conditioning techniques to keep us from getting off topic?\nHoward: Like behavior modification?\nSheldon: Yeah, exactly. Did you know those techniques were used to actually teach pigeons to play ping-pong?\nRaj: That cannot be true.\nShortly afterwards.\nRaj: Hey, it was match point.\nLeonard: Some psychologists perform operant conditioning with punishment. Maybe we can come up with a punishment for straying off topic.\nRaj: Not getting to see who wins at pigeon ping-pong comes to mind.\nHoward: We could snap a rubber band on our wrists every time we get sidetracked.\nSheldon: Mmm, not bad. You know, in medieval times, idle chatter was punished with a device called the scold\xe2\x80\x99s bridle. It\xe2\x80\x99s an iron cage that\xe2\x80\x99s locked around the head and pierces the tongue.\nLeonard: If only we had one.\nSheldon: Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99ll check Amazon.\nScene: The hotel room.\nBernadette: Housekeeping.\nAmy: We had a complaint about somebody pooping on a party in there.\nBernadette: It was us the whole time.\nAmy: Why\xe2\x80\x99d you tell her? It was working.\nBernadette: Was it working?\nPenny: Yeah.\nBernadette: Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m so sorry.\nPenny: You guys look like you\xe2\x80\x99re having fun.\nAmy: We\xe2\x80\x99re having the best time.\nBernadette: Guess who won a hundred dollars playing craps.\nPenny: That\xe2\x80\x99s a dollar.\nBernadette: Then guess who wildly overtipped a cocktail waitress.\nAmy: Hey, Penny, hey, let\xe2\x80\x99s go. We found a place that has Australian male strippers.\nBernadette: We want to see if they twirl their junk in the other direction.\nPenny: That sounds so great. But I have a little more studying to do.\nAmy: Can you believe this nerd?\nBernadette: Come on, do you want to sit here being a loser, or do you want to watch me climb into an Australian man\xe2\x80\x99s G-string like a baby kangaroo?\nPenny: All right, guys, look, I would love to go out, but I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to get this done, okay? So have fun at the club. And if you get in trouble, find a policeman. And if he\xe2\x80\x99s taking off his pants, he is not a real policeman.\nAmy: Okay, okay, this is obviously very important to her. Let\xe2\x80\x99s just, we\xe2\x80\x99ll help her study so she can get done quicker. Here, here, I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna quiz you. I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna quiz you. I got your notes. I got your notes. I got your notes. If you want these, they\xe2\x80\x99re gonna be at the strip club.\nBernadette: Aren\xe2\x80\x99t you gonna chase her?\nPenny: To the walk-in closet? Sure.\nScene: Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s lab.\nLeonard: Okay, so we agree, whenever someone takes us off topic they get their arm hair yanked off.\nRaj: And I really can\xe2\x80\x99t let that happen or the girl who does my eyebrows will think I\xe2\x80\x99ve been cheating on her.\nLeonard: All right, now, one benefit of quantum coupling\xe2\x80\xa6\nSheldon: Wait, a question, who decides if someone\xe2\x80\x99s gone off topic?\nLeonard: I think it\xe2\x80\x99ll be pretty clear. If not, we\xe2\x80\x99ll take a vote. Oh, and also\xe2\x80\xa6\nSheldon: Ow. We didn\xe2\x80\x99t vote!\nLeonard: We didn\xe2\x80\x99t have to, that was clearly a tangent. Now come on. Back to work. If we\xe2\x80\x99re leaning towards quantum coupling\xe2\x80\xa6 Aah! Why?\nSheldon: You said quantum coupling. That made me think of the show Quantum Leap. That\xe2\x80\x99s a tangent and it\xe2\x80\x99s your fault.\nHoward: That\xe2\x80\x99s ridiculous. Sheldon, I vote that is not a tangent.\nLeonard: Thank you. And now I owe you one.\nSheldon: Ow. That was your fault.\nHoward: Hey.\nRaj: Ooh, that is a lot of hair. Ow. And now I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna hear it from Jenny.\nLeonard: Everyone stop. This was a stupid idea. Negative reinforcement isn\xe2\x80\x99t working.\nSheldon: I think you mean positive punishment. Negative reinforcement is the removal of a positive stimulus. It\xe2\x80\x99s a common mistake.\nHoward: Negative reinforcement is really wrong?\nSheldon: Oh, it\xe2\x80\x99s used incorrectly all the time. Even Bill Murray makes that mistake in the first scene of Ghostbusters.\nRaj: No way. Not Bill Murray.\nShortly afterwards.\nBill Murray (on screen): I\xe2\x80\x99m studying the effect of negative reinforcement on ESP ability.\nRaj: Huh. Bill Murray did get it wrong.\nHoward: Jump ahead to the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man.\nLeonard: No.\nSheldon: Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s right. We can\xe2\x80\x99t just jump ahead. We have to watch the whole movie.\nLeonard: Look. We keep procrastinating. We saw Back to the Future II, pigeons playing ping-pong, a bunch of countries that look like genitals and one guy whose genitals look like Denmark.\nRaj: Yeah, sorry for clicking on that.\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s late. We\xe2\x80\x99ve wasted hours. Can we please find it in ourselves to do any amount of work tonight?\nSheldon: But we didn\xe2\x80\x99t see them bust one ghost.\nLeonard: So you\xe2\x80\x99re, you\xe2\x80\x99re saying we should stand here in my lab on a Saturday night and watch the rest of Ghostbusters on a crappy laptop?\nSheldon: No.\nScene: The apartment.\nAll: Ghostbusters!\nLeonard: It really does hold up.\nScene: The Vegas strip club.\nBernadette: See? Isn\xe2\x80\x99t this better than a hotel room?\nPenny: Yep. Shake that thing.\nBernadette: Have you ever seen a body so fine?\nAmy: We had some pretty hot corpses in my anatomy class, but none of them moved like that.\nScene: The hotel room.\nPenny: Good morning. You want to go to the pool? Come on, you said it yourself, only nerds and losers stay in the room. Wow, it\xe2\x80\x99s bright out. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it bright? I should probably close these curtains. Nah. Bye.\nBernadette: Would you please close the drapes?\nAmy: Okay.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
