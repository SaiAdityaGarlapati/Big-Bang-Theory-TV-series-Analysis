b'Scene: The cafeteria. Sheldon is drawing on a napkin.\nRaj: What are you drawing over there?\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s a hypothetical containment field for a Frisbee-sized wormhole that could serve as a portal to a parallel universe.\nHoward: Oh, you silly doodlebug.\nLeonard: You know, a lot of scientists believe that making contact with other life-forms would probably not end well for us.\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s a Frisbee-sized wormhole, Leonard. You can block it with a Frisbee. Calm down. (Hands Howard the napkin)\nHoward: Do you expect me to build this?\nSheldon: I expect you to wipe the pudding off your chin. Gentlemen.\nHoward: Have you guys ever noticed that Sheldon always disappears every day at two forty-five?\nLeonard: Really?\nRaj: He probably just goes to the bathroom.\nLeonard: Actually, no, he goes to the bathroom at eight a.m. with optional follow-ups at one forty-five and seven ten high-fibre Fridays.\nRaj: It\xe2\x80\x99s sad that you know that.\nLeonard: Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s just the tip of the sadness iceberg.\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m looking at his public calendar. Two forty-five to three-oh-five, nothing. Yesterday, two forty-five to three-oh-five, nothing, last week, nothing, last month, nothing. He never has anything booked during that time.\nRaj: Twenty minutes a day, completely unaccounted for.\nHoward: We should figure out where he goes.\nRaj: Ooh, this is exciting. Like one of my classic murder mystery dinner parties.\nLeonard: Right, the case of who murdered three Saturday nights of my life?\nHoward: Colonel Koothrapali in the kitchen with the olive spread.\nRaj: It was tapenade and you guys suck.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment. Penny is texting.\nPenny: So, how was work today?\nLeonard: Well, I spent most of the afternoon growing isotopically pure crystals for neutrino detection.\nPenny: That sounds like fun.\nLeonard: Yeah, it was.\nPenny: Oh, good, I guessed right.\nLeonard: Who you talking to?\nPenny: Oh, just this guy I met at school.\nLeonard: Oh, great. We\xe2\x80\x99re still dating, right?\nPenny: Relax. He\xe2\x80\x99s just a friend. We\xe2\x80\x99re doing an oral report together. He\xe2\x80\x99s really nice.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, what was that? I had a little stroke after oral.\nPenny: Would you stop? Look, he just moved here from London, okay? He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t really know anybody.\nLeonard: Oh, good, an English accent, the sexiest accent you can have.\nPenny: No. That\xe2\x80\x99s not true. There\xe2\x80\x99s French, there\xe2\x80\x99s Italian. No, you\xe2\x80\x99re right, it\xe2\x80\x99s the best.\nLeonard: Did you tell him you have a boyfriend?\nPenny: It didn\xe2\x80\x99t come up.\nLeonard: Well, maybe you should tell him.\nPenny: What am I supposed to say?\nLeonard: Say, can\xe2\x80\x99t talk right now, hanging with my boyfriend. England sucks, you suck, USA number one.\nPenny: Fine. Hanging with my boyfriend. Talk to you later. Happy?\nLeonard: Yes. Thank you.\nPenny: Mm-hmm. Hmm.\nLeonard: What did he say?\nPenny: Nothing.\nLeonard: What?\nPenny: Did your boyfriend make you type that?\nLeonard: I hate this guy.\nPenny: Don\xe2\x80\x99t be like that.\nLeonard: Come on, trust me, he\xe2\x80\x99s hitting on you.\nPenny: No, he\xe2\x80\x99s not. We\xe2\x80\x99re just friends. Look, is this gonna be a problem? Because he\xe2\x80\x99s supposed to come over tomorrow to work.\nLeonard: Really? Here?\nPenny: If it makes you uncomfortable, I\xe2\x80\x99ll switch partners, even though the thing\xe2\x80\x99s due next week and everyone already has a partner and I\xe2\x80\x99ll probably end up failing the class.\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99d be great. Thank you.\nScene: The corridor outside Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s office.\nHoward: Two forty-four, Right on schedule. Hey, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Oh, hello.\nHoward: Raj and I are heading over to the genetics lab to pet the glow-in-the-dark bunny. Want to come with us?\nSheldon: No, thank you.\nRaj: Are you sure? They turn off the lights, and it\xe2\x80\x99s like a cute little laser show that poops all over the place.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m quite sure. Good day.\nHoward: Well, where are you going?\nSheldon: Where are you going?\nRaj: We just told you.\nSheldon: I just told you.\nHoward: No, you didn\xe2\x80\x99t.\nSheldon: Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s your word against mine; see you in court.\nHoward: Should we follow him?\nRaj: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, I\xe2\x80\x99m torn. I want to know where he\xe2\x80\x99s going, but now I kind of want to play with the bunny.\nAlex: Hi, guys.\nHoward: Hey, Alex, do you know where your boss just went?\nAlex: No.\nHoward: Don\xe2\x80\x99t you know his schedule?\nAlex: All I know is corduroy makes too much noise and I have to go find quieter pants.\nHoward: Come on.\nRaj: Boy, what I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t give to get her out of those pants and into something a little more stylish.\nScene: A corridor in the basement. Sheldon takes out a key, unlocks a door and enters.\nHoward: This is where he goes? What\xe2\x80\x99s in there?\nRaj: I think it\xe2\x80\x99s an old storage room.\nHoward: What could he be doing in there every day for twenty minutes?\nRaj: Well, he\xe2\x80\x99s not doing twenty-minute abs, because if he were, he would have way better abs. Can you hear anything?\nHoward: Not yet. What are you doing?\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99m listening.\nHoward: Can\xe2\x80\x99t you face the other way and listen?\nRaj: I can\xe2\x80\x99t do anything right for you, can I?\nHoward: What the hell is he up to?\nRaj: He is kind of a weirdo. Maybe he\xe2\x80\x99s got Leonard Nimoy chained up in there. Or Bill Gates. Or Stephen Hawking.\nHoward: Why would he chain up Stephen Hawking?\nRaj: Howard, please, you can\xe2\x80\x99t treat the man differently just because he\xe2\x80\x99s disabled. That\xe2\x80\x99s not okay.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: If you\xe2\x80\x99re wondering why I\xe2\x80\x99ve been staring through the peephole, I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to get a look at this guy who\xe2\x80\x99s coming over to Penny\xe2\x80\x99s.\nSheldon: To be honest, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know you were here.\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s not a big deal. He\xe2\x80\x99s just in her history class. They\xe2\x80\x99re working on a project together. I don\xe2\x80\x99t even know why I care. You know what, I don\xe2\x80\x99t care.\nSheldon: You think you don\xe2\x80\x99t care?\nLeonard: This is silly. I have nothing to worry about.\nSheldon: Oh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I mean, statistically speaking, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you have something to worry about.\nLeonard: What do you mean?\nSheldon: Well, if we assume your looks are average, yeah, right off the bat, fifty percent of men on Earth are more attractive than you. That\xe2\x80\x99s one point five billion handsome lads standing by, waiting to rain on your parade.\nLeonard: Well, yeah, but this isn\xe2\x80\x99t just about looks. I\xe2\x80\x99m, I\xe2\x80\x99m way above average in a lot of other things.\nSheldon: Not height, vision, athleticism, or ability to digest dairy products.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about important things like emotional maturity.\nSheldon: You were just spying on your girlfriend through a peephole.\nLeonard: I liked it better when you thought I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t here.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m not saying you don\xe2\x80\x99t have attractive qualities. Your choice of friends is impeccable, you\xe2\x80\x99re a good sleeper, and last but not least, you buy the grapes I like. You\xe2\x80\x99re a real catch compared to some snoring guy with a fridge full of lousy grapes.\nLeonard: None of this matters. I trust that Penny cares about me, and nothing\xe2\x80\x99s gonna happen with this guy.\nSheldon: Well, unless of course he\xe2\x80\x99s a skilled hypnotist.\nLeonard: What?\nSheldon: While unlikely, it\xe2\x80\x99s still a statistical possibility. She might be performing sexual acts with him and not even know it.\nLeonard: Now you\xe2\x80\x99re just being ridiculous.\nSheldon: Am I? The mind\xe2\x80\x99s a mysterious thing, Leonard. He could be having the time of his life while she thinks she\xe2\x80\x99s a chicken pecking for corn.\nScene: The university basement.\nRaj: Look at us, sneaking around in the middle of the night like a couple of cat burglars.\nHoward: I think we\xe2\x80\x99re more like ninjas.\nRaj: I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be a ninja, I want to be a cat burglar.\nHoward: Fine, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be a ninja, you be a cat burglar.\nRaj: No, we both have to be the same thing. Okay, we\xe2\x80\x99re ninjas.\nHoward: Thank you.\nRaj: But next time, we\xe2\x80\x99ll be cat burglars.\nHoward: It\xe2\x80\x99s locked.\nRaj: Are you sure?\nHoward: Yes, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure. Now, you stand guard, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to\xe2\x80\xa6\nRaj (trying door): It\xe2\x80\x99s locked.\nHoward: Just keep an eye out. I\xe2\x80\x99ll have this open in a minute.\nRaj: When did you learn how to pick locks?\nHoward: When I was starting to do magic in junior high, I thought I could be an escape artist like Harry Houdini.\nRaj: How did that work out?\nHoward: Pretty good. I managed to escape friends, popularity, and every party thrown in a twelve mile radius. There. Ready?\nRaj: Hold on, hold on.\nHoward: What?\nRaj: Sheldon is a very smart man, and he obviously wants to keep this a secret.\nHoward: Yeah, so?\nRaj: What if it\xe2\x80\x99s booby-trapped?\nHoward: Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry, I\xe2\x80\x99m one step ahead of him.\nRaj: Great, what\xe2\x80\x99s your pl\xe2\x80\xa6 (Howard pushes him inside)\nHoward: Are we good?\nRaj: Yeah. Huh. Forty-three? What the hell does that mean?\nHoward: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. The solution to an equation?\nRaj: Maybe. It\xe2\x80\x99s a prime number. Encryption systems are built on prime numbers.\nHoward: What kind of secret does Sheldon have to encrypt?\nRaj: He\xe2\x80\x99s always been very cagey about what he puts in his egg salad to make it so tasty.\nHoward: It\xe2\x80\x99s paprika.\nRaj: Really? Well, oh, okay, one mystery solved.\nScene: The apartment.\nVoice from Outside: Okay, good night.\nPenny (off): Thanks, Cole. See you at school.\nCole (off): See you.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99ll be right back.\nSheldon: I thought you left a long time ago.\nLeonard (rushing to catch up with Cole): \xe2\x80\x98sup?\nCole: Hey.\nLeonard: You, uh, moving into the apartment on the fifth floor?\nCole: No, I was just visiting a friend.\nLeonard: Oh, cool. That cute blonde on four?\nCole: Yeah. You know her?\nLeonard: I, well, I see her around. I like to keep my distance because her boyfriend is a pretty scary dude.\nCole: Really?\nLeonard: Yeah. He\xe2\x80\x99s ganged up.\nCole: She told me he\xe2\x80\x99s a scientist.\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99s the name of his gang. The Scientists. They are crazy.\nCole: Well, thanks for the tip.\nLeonard: No problem, brother. Stay frosty. (Cole leaves. Leonard spots Penny watching.) We\xe2\x80\x99re still dating, right?\nScene: The cafeteria.\nAlex: Oh, hello, Dr. Hofstadter.\nLeonard: Hey, Alex, and call me Leonard. Dr. Hofstadter is my father. And my mother. And my sister. And our cat. Although, I\xe2\x80\x99m pretty sure Dr. Boots Hofstadter\xe2\x80\x99s degree was honorary.\nAlex: May I join you, Leonard?\nLeonard: Sure.\nAlex: Thanks.\nLeonard: Hey, Alex, let me ask you something. My girlfriend knows this guy at school. He\xe2\x80\x99s got an English accent.\nAlex: Ooh, I love English accents.\nLeonard: Yeah, you all do. Anyway, I feel like he\xe2\x80\x99s hitting on her. She says he\xe2\x80\x99s just being nice and that I should trust her.\nAlex: It\xe2\x80\x99s probably harmless. You know how it is. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you get hit on all the time.\nLeonard: Right. Because girls are always like, ooh, that guy owns two Star Trek uniforms and gets a lot of ear infections. I got to get me some of that.\nAlex: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, I bet it happens more than you realize.\nLeonard: Trust me, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t.\nAlex: You sure? You\xe2\x80\x99re cute, you\xe2\x80\x99re funny. Maybe you\xe2\x80\x99re getting hit on, and you don\xe2\x80\x99t even know it.\nLeonard: Really?\nAlex: Yep, pretty sure.\nLeonard (laughs): Okay, I got to get back to work. Thanks for listening.\nAlex: No problem.\nLeonard: Hope-hope no girls rip my clothes off on the way.\nScene: Raj\xe2\x80\x99s office.\nRaj: Come on, we\xe2\x80\x99re smart guys. We can figure this out.\nHoward: Forty-three. What is forty-three? Besides my mom\xe2\x80\x99s neck size.\nRaj: It\xe2\x80\x99s the atomic number for technetium.\nHoward: That stuff\xe2\x80\x99s radioactive.\nRaj: Do you think he\xe2\x80\x99s building a bomb?\nHoward: Ah, it took him two years to put together that Lego Death Star, I\xe2\x80\x99m not worried.\nRaj: Ooh, this could be something. forty-three is the number of calories in half a cup of fat-free yoghurt.\nHoward: Why would you know that?\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. We can\xe2\x80\x99t all eat whatever we want and still stay thin. Wait, in the Hitchhiker\xe2\x80\x99s Guide to the Galaxy, isn\xe2\x80\x99t forty-three the answer to the question of life, the universe,and everything?\nHoward: That\xe2\x80\x99s forty-two, dumb-ass.\nRaj: Hey, hey. Feelings.\nHoward: We should stop. I\xe2\x80\x99m exhausted.\nRaj: Yeah, me, too. We\xe2\x80\x99ve got more important things to do. Who cares what stupid forty-three means?\nHoward: Not me.\nRaj: Let\xe2\x80\x99s go home. You want to get something to eat?\nHoward: Sounds good.\nRaj: What the balls is forty-three?\nHoward: I have to know!\nScene: The stairwell.\nLeonard: Hi.\nPenny: Hey, shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you be out with your gang, spray painting equations on the side of buildings?\nLeonard: Come on, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.\nPenny: I just can\xe2\x80\x99t believe you don\xe2\x80\x99t trust me.\nLeonard: I do, of course I do.\nPenny: Then why did you embarrass me in front of my friend, who, by the way, knew exactly who you were?\nLeonard: Really?\nPenny: Your picture\xe2\x80\x99s on my refrigerator.\nLeonard: Oh. You know, I\xe2\x80\x99m really starting to not like this guy.\nPenny: What is your problem? Do you use up all your thinking at work and then have none left over for when you get home?\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. It-it-it\xe2\x80\x99s hard sometimes. Everywhere you go, guys hit on you, even if I\xe2\x80\x99m standing right there. And they\xe2\x80\x99re all taller than me. Why is everyone taller than me? You know what, this is all in my head. It\xe2\x80\x99s my problem, not yours.\nPenny: Leonard, why do you always do this? Listen to me, you\xe2\x80\x99re the one I\xe2\x80\x99m with. You know I love you, so will you please relax because you\xe2\x80\x99re driving me crazy.\nLeonard: You know that\xe2\x80\x99s the first time you ever said that you love me.\nPenny: Yeah.\nLeonard: We\xe2\x80\x99re just supposed to pretend it\xe2\x80\x99s not a big deal?\nPenny: That\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what we\xe2\x80\x99re gonna do because you\xe2\x80\x99re about to make me cry, and we both know if I start crying, you\xe2\x80\x99re gonna start crying.\nLeonard: You\xe2\x80\x99re right, you should go.\nPenny (crying): All right.\nLeonard (crying): She loves me. (Receives text) Hey, it\xe2\x80\x99s Alex. Nice having coffee with you. If you want to talk more, I\xe2\x80\x99m always available. Smiley face, smiley face. What a friendly girl.\nScene: The cafeteria.\nHoward: Okay, picture\xe2\x80\x99s up. Looks like the camera\xe2\x80\x99s working.\nRaj: That\xe2\x80\x99s good quality video.\nHoward: It better be. It\xe2\x80\x99s the spare camera for the Mars rover.\nRaj: How did you get your hands on that?\nHoward: Million dollar camera, ten dollar lock.\nRaj: Oh, my God, here he comes. This is it.\nHoward: What the hell is that thing?\nRaj: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\nSheldon (on screen): This is Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Experimental log. Wormhole generator test forty-four.\nHoward: Wormhole generator test? (On screen a wormhole appears)\nSheldon: The first forty-three parallel universes I\xe2\x80\x99ve checked proved to be empty. I see no reason to suspect universe number forty-four will be any different. (Puts his head in the wormhole)\nHoward: Oh, my God!\nRaj: Holy crap!\nSheldon (with an alien creature stuck to his face): Oh! It\xe2\x80\x99s eating my face!\nRaj: Aah! It\xe2\x80\x99s eating his face!\nSheldon (throwing alien onto the laptop): I found your webcam and replaced the video feed. You two should be ashamed of yourselves.\nRaj: Sheldon, we\xe2\x80\x99re really sorry.\nHoward: Yeah, really sorry.\nSheldon: Sorry? You may not realize it, but I have difficulty navigating certain aspects of daily life. You know, understanding sarcasm, feigning interest in others, not talking about trains as much as I want to. It\xe2\x80\x99s exhausting. Which is why, for twenty minutes a day, I like to go down to that room, turn my mind off and do what I need to do to recharge.\nHoward: But what are you doing in there?\nRaj: And what does forty-three mean?\nSheldon: You don\xe2\x80\x99t need to know, you don\xe2\x80\x99t deserve to know, and you will never know.\nRaj: Yeah, well, I know how to make your egg salad now.\nScene: The room in the basement. Sheldon enters, takes out a box, takes a beanbag from the box, then starts playing keepie-uppie,\nSheldon: One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight\xe2\x80\xa6 Drat. I\xe2\x80\x99m never going to get to forty-three again. One, two, three, four\xe2\x80\xa6 Rats.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
