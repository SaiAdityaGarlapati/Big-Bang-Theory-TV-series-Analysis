b'Scene: Sheldon and Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s apartment. Sheldon, Leonard, Howard and Raj are using laptops. All are wearing microphone headsets.\nHoward: Alright, just a few more feet, and\xe2\x80\xa6. here we are gentlemen, the Gates of Elzebub.\nSheldon: Good lord!\nRaj: Oooh.\nLeonard: Don\xe2\x80\x99t panic, this is what the last 97 hours have been about.\nHoward: Stay frosty, there\xe2\x80\x99s a horde of armed goblins on the other side of that gate guarding the Sword of Azeroth.\nLeonard: Warriors, unsheathe your weapons, magic wielders raise your wands.\nSheldon: Lock and load.\nHoward: Raj, blow up the gates.\nRaj: Blowing the gates. Control, shift, B! Oh, my God, so many goblins!\nHoward: Don\xe2\x80\x99t just stand there, slash and move, slash and move.\nLeonard: Stay in formation.\nHoward: Leonard, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got one on your tail.\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99s alright, my tail\xe2\x80\x99s prehensile, I\xe2\x80\x99ll swat him off.\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99ve got him Leonard. Tonight I spice my meat with goblin blood!\nLeonard: Raj, no, it\xe2\x80\x99s a trap, they\xe2\x80\x99re flanking us!\nRaj: Oooh, he\xe2\x80\x99s got me.\nHoward: Sheldon, he\xe2\x80\x99s got Raj, use your sleath spell. Sheldon! Sheldon!\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99ve got the Sword of Azeroth!\nLeonard: Forget the sword, Sheldon, help Raj.\nSheldon: There is no more Sheldon, I am the Swordmaster!\nHoward: Leonard look out!\nLeonard: Dammit man, we\xe2\x80\x99re dying here.\nSheldon: Goodbye, peasants.\nLeonard: The bastard teleported.\nRaj: He\xe2\x80\x99s selling the Sword of Azeroth on ebay.\nLeonard: You betrayed us for money, who are you?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m a rogue knight elf, don\xe2\x80\x99t you people read character descriptions? Wait, wait, wait, somebody just clicked \xe2\x80\x9cbuy it now.\xe2\x80\x9d\nHoward: I am the Swordmaster!\nCredits sequence\nScene: The same.\nSheldon: Wooh, I\xe2\x80\x99m all sweaty, anybody want to log on to second life and go swimming, I just built a virtual pool.\nLeonard: No, I can\xe2\x80\x99t look at you or your avatar right now.\n(Sound of female laughter from out in the hall).\nHoward: Sounds like your neighbour\xe2\x80\x99s home.\nLeonard: Excuse me.\nSheldon: Don\xe2\x80\x99t forget the mail you took accidentally on purpose so you\xe2\x80\x99d have an excuse to talk to her.\nLeonard: Oh, right, right right right right.\nHoward: Stealing snail mail, very old school, I like it.\nLeonard (exiting to hallway): Penny, the mailman did it again, he\xe2\x80\xa6 (looks up to see Penny kissing a hunky man) Oh! Sorry.\nPenny: Um, no, hi Leonard, this is Doug, Doug, this is my neighbour Leonard.\nDoug: What\xe2\x80\x99s up bro.\nLeonard: Not much. Bro.\nPenny: Is, is everything okay.\nLeonard: Uh, yeah, uh, I just, I got your mail again, here.\nPenny: Thank you, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to talk to that mailman.\nLeonard: Oh no, that\xe2\x80\x99s probably not such a good idea. Civil servants have a documented propensity to, you know, snap.\nPenny: Okay, well, thank you, again.\nLeonard: No problem. Bye. Oh, and, bye, bro! (Returns to apartment).\nSheldon: Penny for your thoughts.\nRaj: What\xe2\x80\x99s the matter.\nLeonard: No, I\xe2\x80\x99m fine. Penny\xe2\x80\x99s fine, the guy she\xe2\x80\x99s kissing is really fine and\xe2\x80\xa6\nHoward: Kissing, what kind of kissing? Cheeks? Lips? Chaste? French?\nLeonard: What is wrong with you?\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m a romantic.\nSheldon: Please don\xe2\x80\x99t tell me that your hopeless infatuation is devolving into pointless jealousy.\nLeonard: No, I\xe2\x80\x99m not jealous, I\xe2\x80\x99m just a little concerned for her. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t like the look of the guy that she was with.\nHoward: Because he looked better than you?\nLeonard: Yeah. He was kinda dreamy.\nSheldon: Well, at least now you can retrieve the black box from the twisted smouldering wreckage that was once your fantasy of dating her, and analyse the data so that you don\xe2\x80\x99t crash into geek mountain again.\nHoward: I disagree, love is not a sprint, it\xe2\x80\x99s a marathon. A relentless pursuit that only ends when she falls into your arms. Or hits you with the pepper spray.\nLeonard: Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m done with Penny. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to be more realistic and go after someone my own speed.\nRaj: Like who?\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Olivia Geiger?\nSheldon: The dietician at the cafeteria with the limp and the lazy eye?\nLeonard: Yeah.\nSheldon: Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you have a shot there. I have noticed that Lesley Winkle recently started shaving her legs. Now, given that winter is coming one can only assume that she is signalling sexual availability.\nHoward: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, you guys work in the same lab.\nLeonard: So?\nHoward: There are pitfalls, trust me, I know. When it comes to sexual harassment law I\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\xa6 a bit of a self-taught expert.\nLeonard: Look, Howard, if I were to ask Lesley Winkle out it would just be for dinner, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to walk into the lab, ask her to strip naked and dance for me.\nHoward: Oh, then you\xe2\x80\x99re probably okay.\nScene: Howard and Lesley\xe2\x80\x99s lab.\nLeonard: Hello Lesley.\nLesley: Hi Leonard.\nLeonard: Lesley I would like to propose an experiment.\nLesley: Goggles, Leonard.\nLeonard: Right. Lesley, I would like to propose an experiment.\nLesley: Hang on. I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to see how long it takes a five hundred kilowatt oxygen iodine laser to heat up my cup o\xe2\x80\x99 noodles.\nLeonard: Pfff, I\xe2\x80\x99ve done it, about two seconds, 2.6 for minestrone. Anyway, I was thinking more of a bio-social exploration with a neuro-chemical overlay.\nLesley: Wait, are you asking me out?\nLeonard: I was going to characterise it as the modification of our colleague/friendship paradigm, with the addition of a date-like component. But we don\xe2\x80\x99t need to quibble over terminology.\nLesley: What sort of experiment would you propose?\nLeonard: There is a generally accepted pattern in this area, I would pick you up, take you to a restaurant, then we would see a movie, probably a romantic comedy featuring the talents of Hugh Grant or Sandra Bullock.\nLesley: Interesting. And would you agree that the primary way we would evaluate either the success or failure of the date would be based on the bio-chemical reaction during the goodnight kiss.\nLeonard: Heartrate, pheromones, etc, yes.\nLesley: Well, why don\xe2\x80\x99t we just stipulate that the date goes well and move to the key variable.\nLeonard: You mean, kiss you now?\nLesley: Yes.\nLeonard: Can you define the parameters of the kiss?\nLesley: Closed mouth but romantic. Mint?\nLeonard: Thank you. (Takes mint). Shall I count down from three?\nLesley: No, I think it needs to be spontaneous.\n(They kiss.)\nLesley: What do you think.\nLeonard: You proposed the experiment, I think you should present your findings first.\nLesley: Fair enough. On the plus side, it was a good kiss, reasonable technique, no extraneous spittle. On the other hand, no arousal.\nLeonard: None?\nLesley: None.\nLeonard: Ah. Well, thank you for your time.\nLesley: Thank you.\n(They shake hands. Leonard leaves. Then returns.)\nLeonard: None at all?\nScene: Sheldon and Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s flat. Sheldon, Raj and Howard are playing Jenga.\nHoward: Sheldon, if you were a robot, and I knew and you didn\xe2\x80\x99t, would you want me to tell you?\nSheldon: That depends. When I learn that I\xe2\x80\x99m a robot, will I be able to handle it?\nHoward: Maybe, although the history of science-fiction is not on your side.\nSheldon: Uh, let me ask you this. When I learn that I\xe2\x80\x99m a robot, would I be bound by Asimov\xe2\x80\x99s three laws of robotics?\nRaj: You might be bound by them right now.\nHoward: That\xe2\x80\x99s true. Have you ever harmed a human being, or through inaction allowed a human being to come to harm?\nSheldon: Of course not.\nHoward: Have you ever harmed yourself, or allowed yourself to be harmed except in cases where a human being would have been endangered?\nSheldon: Well, no.\nHoward: I smell robot.\nLeonard (entering): Hey, what\xe2\x80\x99s going on.\nSheldon: The internet\xe2\x80\x99s been down for half an hour.\nRaj: Also, Sheldon may be a robot.\nHoward: So, how did it go with Lesley?\nLeonard: Oh, we tried kissing, but the earth didn\xe2\x80\x99t move. I mean any more than the 383 miles that it was going to move anyway.\nSheldon: Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen that look before. This is just going to be two weeks of moping and tedious emo songs, and calling me to come down to pet stores to look at cats. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if I can take it.\nRaj: You could power down.\nHoward: Well, as usual, Wolowitz has the solution. I happen to know a place where there are plenty of eligible women, and Leonard could have his pick.\nScene: A salsa class. The four guys and a random fat bloke salsa opposite five middle-aged women.\nClass instructor: Remember the Latin hips. Shoulders stay still, and we sway. One two three. Five six seven.\nHoward (to Leonard): I think Mrs Tishman\xe2\x80\x99s got her eye on you. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been there, you\xe2\x80\x99re in for a treat.\nScene: The flat, Leonard is entering, singing to himself a depressing emo song.\nSheldon: Oh, good lord.\nLeonard (singing): You don\xe2\x80\x99t know me, you don\xe2\x80\x99t wear my chains\xe2\x80\xa6 God, that\xe2\x80\x99s a good song.\nSheldon: If you\xe2\x80\x99re compiling a mix CD for a double suicide. (Leonard is taking supplies out of a bag) Oh, I hope that scratching post is for you.\nLeonard: I know what you\xe2\x80\x99re thinking, I\xe2\x80\x99ve taken your asthma into account. There\xe2\x80\x99s a feline geneticist in San Diego who has developed the cutest little hypo-allergenic calicos.\nSheldon: Leonard, listen to me\xe2\x80\xa6\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99ve been thinking about names, I\xe2\x80\x99m kind of torn between Einstein, Newton and Sergeant Fuzzyboots.\nSheldon: Leonard, do you really think you can satisfy your need for a relationship with a genetically altered cat?\nLeonard: Maybe, if it\xe2\x80\x99s a cute little cuddly cat.\nSheldon: Oh, come on, Leonard! This is obviously about Penny.\nLeonard: It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter. The woman\xe2\x80\x99s not interested in me, the woman rejected me.\nSheldon: Okay, look, I think that you have as much of a chance of having a sexual relationship with Penny as the Hubble Telescope does of discovering at the centre of every black hole is a little man with a flashlight searching for a circuit breaker. Nevertheless, I do feel obligated to point out to you that she did no reject you. You did not ask her out.\nLeonard: You\xe2\x80\x99re right. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t ask her out, I should ask her out.\nSheldon: No. No, now that was not my point. My point was, don\xe2\x80\x99t buy a cat.\nLeonard: No, but you\xe2\x80\x99re right. I should march over there and ask her out.\nSheldon: Oh, goody, we\xe2\x80\x99re getting a cat.\nScene: The hallway. Leonard knocks on Penny\xe2\x80\x99s door.\nPenny (opening door): Ah, hey Leonard.\nLeonard: Good afternoon Penny, so hi, hey. Uh\xe2\x80\xa6 I was wondering if you had plans for dinner.\nPenny: Uh, do you mean dinner tonight?\nLeonard: There is an inherent ambiguity in the word dinner. Technically it refers to the largest meal of the day whenever it is consumed, so, to clarify here, by dinner I mean supper.\nPenny: Supper?\nLeonard: Or dinner. I was thinking six thirty, if you can go, or a different time.\nPenny: Uh, six thirty\xe2\x80\x99s great.\nLeonard: Really? Great!\nPenny: Yeah, I like hanging out with you guys.\nLeonard: Us guys?\nPenny: You know, Sheldon, Howard, Raj, who all\xe2\x80\x99s coming?\nLeonard: They\xe2\x80\xa6. might all be there. Or a subset of them might be there, uh, algebraically speaking there are too many unknowns, for example Sheldon had Quizznos for lunch, sometimes he finds that filling, other times he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t, it\xe2\x80\x99s no fault of Quizznos, they have a varied menu.\nPenny: Okay, whatever, it sounds like fun.\nLeonard: Great. Did we say a time?\nPenny: Six thirty.\nLeonard: And that\xe2\x80\x99s still good for you.\nPenny: It\xe2\x80\x99s fine.\nLeonard: Cos it\xe2\x80\x99s not carved in stone.\nPenny: No, six thirty\xe2\x80\x99s great.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99ll get my chisel.\nPenny: Why?\nLeonard: To\xe2\x80\xa6 carve the\xe2\x80\xa6 okay, I\xe2\x80\x99ll see you six thirty.\nScene: Sheldon and Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s apartment. Leonard enters from bedrooms, dressed in a smart shirt and trousers. They are covered in sweat stains.\nLeonard: How do I look?\nSheldon: Could you be more specific?\nLeonard: Can you tell I\xe2\x80\x99m perspiring a little?\nSheldon: No. The dark crescent-shaped patterns under your arms conceal it nicely. What time is your date?\nLeonard: Six thirty.\nSheldon: Perfect, that gives you two hours and fifteen minutes for that dense molecular cloud of Aramis to dissipate.\nLeonard: Is it too much?\nSheldon: Not if you\xe2\x80\x99re a rugby team.\nLeonard: By the way, if it should ever come up, you didn\xe2\x80\x99t join us because you stuffed yourself with a chicken carbonara sub at Quizznos.\nSheldon: Why would I join you?\nLeonard: No reason. Oh, you know what, maybe this isn\xe2\x80\x99t such a good idea.\nSheldon: Oh, no, no, no, well now, there\xe2\x80\x99s always the possibility that alcohol and poor judgement on her part might lead to a nice romantic evening.\nLeonard: You\xe2\x80\x99re right, alcohol, poor judgement, it could go well.\nSheldon: Of course, there\xe2\x80\x99s the other possibility that this date kicks off a rather unpleasant six months of the two of you passing awkwardly in the hall until one of you breaks down and moves to another zip code.\nLeonard: You could have stopped at \xe2\x80\x9cit could go well.\xe2\x80\x9d\nSheldon: If I could of, I would of.\nLeonard: I mean, I\xe2\x80\x99m a perfectly nice guy. There\xe2\x80\x99s no reason we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t go to the restaurant and have a lovely dinner. Maybe take a walk afterwards, talk about things we have in common, \xe2\x80\x9cyou love pottery? I love pottery!\xe2\x80\x9d You know, there\xe2\x80\x99s a pause, we both know what\xe2\x80\x99s happening, I lean in, we kiss, it\xe2\x80\x99s a little tentative at first but then I realise, she\xe2\x80\x99s kissing me back, and she\xe2\x80\x99s biting my lower lip, you know, she wants me, this thing is going the distance, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have sex! Oh God! Oh, my God!\nSheldon: Is the sex starting now?\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m having a panic attack.\nSheldon: Oh, okay, well then, calm down.\nLeonard: If I could calm down I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be having a panic attack, that\xe2\x80\x99s why they call it a panic attack.\nSheldon: Alright, alright, well, just, sit down, yes, sit down, now close your eyes.\nLeonard: Why?\nSheldon: Just do it.\nLeonard: Okay.\nSheldon: Now try to increase your alpha-wave activity.\nLeonard: What?\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s a bio-feedback technique, it\xe2\x80\x99s relaxation through brain-wave manipulation, I read a paper about it in the Journal of American Neuroscience, it was a little sparsely sourced but I think the basic science is valid, I probably have it here somewhere.\nLeonard: Oh, who am I kidding, I can\xe2\x80\x99t go through with this, you need to call her and cancel.\nSheldon: Me?\nLeonard: Yes.\nSheldon: What should I tell her.\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Tell her I\xe2\x80\x99m sick.\nSheldon: Okay.\nLeonard: Not the kind of illness that will make her want to come over and take care of me, but nothing so critical that she\xe2\x80\x99ll feel uncomfortable going out with me in the future if I want to try this again.\nSheldon: Got it. So I\xe2\x80\x99m assuming nothing venereal. I\xe2\x80\x99ll just tell her that you had a routine colonoscopy and haven\xe2\x80\x99t quite bounced back.\nLeonard: Give me the phone.\nSheldon: But I thought you wanted to cancel?\nLeonard: I can\xe2\x80\x99t because if I don\xe2\x80\x99t show up she\xe2\x80\x99ll still be expecting you.\nSheldon: Why would she be expecting me?\nLeonard: Stop asking me all these questions, I need to take another shower.\nScene: A restaurant.\nPenny: So are the rest of the guys meeting us here?\nLeonard: Oh, yeah, no. Turns out that Raj and Howard had to work, and Sheldon had a colonoscopy and he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t quite bounced back yet.\nPenny: Ooh, my uncle just had a colonoscopy.\nLeonard: You\xe2\x80\x99re kidding, well, then, that\xe2\x80\x99s something we have in common.\nPenny: How?\nLeonard: We both have people in our lives who\xe2\x80\xa6 want to nip intestinal polyps in the bud.\nPenny: So, what\xe2\x80\x99s new in the world of physics?\nLeonard: Nothing.\nPenny: Really, nothing?\nLeonard: Well, with the exception of string theory, not much has happened since the 1930\xe2\x80\x99s, and you can\xe2\x80\x99t prove string theory, at best you can say \xe2\x80\x9chey, look, my idea has an internal logical consistency.\xe2\x80\x9d\nPenny: Ah. Well I\xe2\x80\x99m sure things will pick up.\nLeonard: What\xe2\x80\x99s new at the Cheesecake Factory?\nPenny: Oh, uh, not much. We do have a chocolate key lime that\xe2\x80\x99s moving pretty well.\nLeonard: Good. Good. And what about your, uh, hallway friend.\nPenny: Doug? Oh, yeah, I dunno, I mean, he\xe2\x80\x99s nice and funny, but\xe2\x80\xa6\nWaitress: Can I get you started with some drinks?\nLeonard: No, (waves her away) You were saying, but\xe2\x80\xa6\nPenny: I\xe2\x80\x99d like a drink.\nLeonard: Just say the but thing about Doug and then I\xe2\x80\x99ll get her back.\nPenny: Okay, well, you know, it\xe2\x80\x99s just me. I\xe2\x80\x99m still getting over this break-up with Kurt, and this thing with Doug would be just rebound sex.\nLeonard: Ugh, don\xe2\x80\x99t get me started on rebound sex.\nPenny: It\xe2\x80\x99s just, it\xe2\x80\x99s my pattern. I break up, then I find some cute guy, and then it\xe2\x80\x99s just thirty six meaningless of\xe2\x80\xa6 well, you know.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure that I do. Um, is that one thirty-six hour experience, or is it thirty six hours spread out over say, one\xe2\x80\xa6 glorious summer.\nPenny: No, it\xe2\x80\x99s usually over a weekend, and trust me, you do not feel good after it.\nLeonard: Well, chafing, right?\nPenny: Emotionally.\nLeonard: Of course, yeah, emotional chafing. Hey, do you want to see something cool? (Penny nods.) I can make this olive go into this glass without touching it.\nPenny: How?\nLeonard: Physics. (He places the glass over the olive and spins it until the olive gets caught up on the side).\nPenny: Wow, centrifugal force!\nLeonard: Actually, it\xe2\x80\x99s centripetal force, which is an inward force generated by the glass acting on the olive. (The olive drops.) Excuse me. (Leonard disappears under table.)Now, if you were riding on the olive, you\xe2\x80\x99d be in a non-inertial reference frame, and would (he bangs his head on the underside of the table.)\nPenny: Are you okay?\nLeonard: Yeah, I\xe2\x80\x99m okay. Did you spill ketchup?\nPenny: No.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m not okay.\nScene: The stairwell of the apartment building.\nPenny: Are you sure you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to go to the emergency room?\nLeonard: No, no, I\xe2\x80\x99m okay, it\xe2\x80\x99s stopped bleeding.\nPenny: I know, but you did throw up. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that a sign of a concussion?\nLeonard: Yes, but I get car sick too, so\xe2\x80\xa6\nPenny: Okay.\nLeonard: Sorry about your car, by the way.\nPenny: Oh, no, it\xe2\x80\x99s fine, you got most of it out the window.\nLeonard: The poor guy on the bike. I had a nice time.\nPenny: Yeah, me too. Um, good night. (Leonard turns across hallway.) Leonard?\nLeonard: Yeah.\nPenny: Was this supposed to be a date?\nLeonard: This? No. No, of course not, this was just you and me hanging out with a bunch of guys who didn\xe2\x80\x99t show up, because of work and a colonoscopy.\nPenny: Okay, I was just checking.\nLeonard: When I take a girl out on a date, and I do, she knows she\xe2\x80\x99s been dated. Capital D. Bold face, underline, like Day-ted. I think I might have a little concussion, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to go lay down for a while, good night.\nScene: The apartment, Leonard enters.\nSheldon: So, how was your date?\nLeonard: Awesome!\nSheldon: Score one for liquor and poor judgement.\nTeleplay: Bill Prady & Steven Molaro\nStory: Chuck Lorre\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
