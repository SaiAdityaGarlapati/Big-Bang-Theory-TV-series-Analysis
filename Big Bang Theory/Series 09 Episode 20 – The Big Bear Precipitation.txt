b'Scene: The apartment (initially inside a virtual reality device)\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s nice to get back to nature. Why don\xe2\x80\x99t I do this more often? What a beautiful forest. Hello, little butterfly. What\xe2\x80\x99s your Na-oh!\nLeonard: Whatcha doing?\nSheldon: I was enjoying some virtual reality, until you ruined it with your actual face.\nPenny: What am I smelling?\nSheldon: Oh, it\xe2\x80\x99s car air freshener. I was simulating the smell of the forest.\nPenny: That\xe2\x80\x99s not what the forest smells like.\nSheldon: Well, how would I know?\nLeonard: Why are you pretending to be outdoors? You hate it.\nSheldon: Hmm? Oh. Amy showed me a compelling study that demonstrated the cognitive benefit of spending time in the wilderness.\nLeonard: Buddy, I am ready to drive you into the wilderness any time you want and leave you there.\nSheldon: Well, make your jokes, but some of the participants who spent four days in the woods away from all technology reported a fifty percent gain in reasoning skills upon their return.\nPenny: Okay, if that\xe2\x80\x99s true, why aren\xe2\x80\x99t there more genius squirrels?\nSheldon: You may need this more than I do.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The apartment.\nAmy: Here\xe2\x80\x99s your tea.\nSheldon: Oh. Do not sneak up on a guy when he\xe2\x80\x99s sitting on a log.\nAmy: You know, if you really want to be in nature, why don\xe2\x80\x99t we rent a cabin?\nSheldon: Look, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, when did you even get here? I\xe2\x80\xa6\nPenny: You know, there\xe2\x80\x99s a cabin in Big Bear that a doctor I work with keeps offering me.\nLeonard: Because he\xe2\x80\x99s hitting on you?\nPenny: She.\nLeonard: Oh, good.\nPenny: But I could get her.\nAmy: We could all go for the weekend. It\xe2\x80\x99ll be fun.\nSheldon: Excuse me. Here, look up fun, get back to me.\nLeonard: You and I could still go and have a nice weekend.\nPenny: Sure.\nAmy: Come on, Sheldon, let\xe2\x80\x99s go with them.\nSheldon: I hardly think so. You be sure and say hello to all the mosquitoes, bees, bears, snakes, possums, poison oak, oh, and last, but not least, teenagers with guitars.\nPenny: I\xe2\x80\x99ll see if it\xe2\x80\x99s available.\nAmy: You know, if that study\xe2\x80\x99s real, Leonard might come back smarter than you.\nSheldon: Are you trying to manipulate me?\nAmy: Yes.\nSheldon: Well done, it worked, we\xe2\x80\x99re going.\nAmy: Yay.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s house.\nBernadette: Come on, Raj, give me a bag.\nRaj: No, no, you\xe2\x80\x99re pregnant. The only thing you carry is our hope for a better tomorrow.\nHoward: Hey, where you been?\nBernadette: Uh, Raj took me to the baby doctor and then we swung by the grocery store.\nHoward: Did you get graham crackers? I mean, are, wuh, is the baby okay?\nBernadette: Yes and yes.\nHoward: I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know you needed help running errands today.\nBernadette: I didn\xe2\x80\x99t, but Raj volunteered.\nHoward: Really?\nBernadette: Yeah, ever since you told him I was pregnant, he\xe2\x80\x99s really been making a fuss over me.\nHoward: Oh. Well, I guess that\xe2\x80\x99s kind of sweet.\nRaj: Bernie, I just forwarded you a list of the top five lactation consultants in Los Angeles. I know my favourite, but I\xe2\x80\x99d love to hear what you think.\nHoward: And it just got weird.\nScene: The apartment.\nPenny: Hey. Amy\xe2\x80\x99s downstairs.\nLeonard: Okay, one sec.\nPenny: Uh, what, what you got goin\xe2\x80\x99 on here?\nLeonard: I bought a baseball cap.\nPenny: I can see that. What team did you get?\nLeonard: Uh, Hufflepuff, from Harry Potter.\nPenny: Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ll be in the woods.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m ready to go.\nLeonard: Anything you\xe2\x80\x99d like to say to him?\nPenny: Nice hat, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Thanks.\nLeonard: Why are you so mean to me?\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s kitchen. Screams are emanating from Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s tablet.\nHoward: What the hell are you watching?\nBernadette: Raj found all these childbirth videos online. This one is of a woman giving birth in a river.\nHoward: Okay, that is the least Jewish thing I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever seen in my life. You feel like Raj is getting a little carried away with all the baby stuff?\nBernadette: I don\xe2\x80\x99t think so. He just wants to be part of the experience.\nHoward: All right, if you say so. What\xe2\x80\x99s in the box?\nBernadette: Oh, it\xe2\x80\x99s an ultrasonic microphone so we can hear the baby\xe2\x80\x99s heartbeat.\nHoward: Oh. That\xe2\x80\x99s cool. Can we try it?\nBernadette: Actually, Raj ordered it. He made me promise to wait till he was here.\nHoward: So he can be part of the experience?\nBernadette: Yeah.\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m surprised he let us conceive without him.\nBernadette: It\xe2\x80\x99s a sore spot, don\xe2\x80\x99t bring it up.\nScene: Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s car.\nPenny: It\xe2\x80\x99s so cute and rustic up here.\nLeonard: I know. Did you see they still have a video rental place? it\xe2\x80\x99s like Colonial Williamsburg.\nSheldon: Well, cell service is down to one bar, so if anyone needs medical attention or to tell a stranger their political views are stupid, now\xe2\x80\x99s the time.\nAmy: Have you ever been off the grid before?\nSheldon: Once. The battery ran out on my phone. I had to wait for my iPad to turn on.\nLeonard: I was afraid he was gonna eat me.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nHoward: Raj just pulled up. I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna say something to him.\nBernadette: Leave it alone. He means well.\nHoward: So you don\xe2\x80\x99t think he needs to rein it in a little?\nBernadette: No, not really.\nHoward: And you\xe2\x80\x99re not concerned he\xe2\x80\x99s acting like somehow this is his kid, too?\nBernadette: He\xe2\x80\x99s just trying to be supportive.\nHoward: Just supportive. Not over-the-top in any way?\nBernadette: No.\nRaj: Hello.\nBernadette: You saw him carrying that.\nHoward: Astronauts saw him carrying that.\nScene: The cabin.\nPenny: This place is great.\nLeonard: So nice of that doctor to just let you use it.\nPenny: Well, she is taking me to an Indigo Girls concert, so hold that thought.\nSheldon: Okay. Well, shall we check each other for ticks?\nAmy: Sheldon, all we did was walk in from the car.\nSheldon: Oh. Well, suit yourself. Who wants to check me?\nAmy: On the other hand, safety first.\nScene: The same, later.\nAmy: Wow, it\xe2\x80\x99s really coming down.\nPenny: This sucks.\nLeonard: And there goes our hike.\nSheldon: Oh, not our hike, now we have to stay safe and warm.\nPenny: You know, we could still go. A little rain isn\xe2\x80\x99t gonna kill us.\nLeonard: Have you been outside in the rain with Sheldon?\nPenny: No.\nLeonard: You\xe2\x80\x99ll wish it would kill you.\nAmy: So what do we do now?\nLeonard: They have some board games.\nSheldon: Eh, most of the Jenga pieces are missing and the Scrabble only has seven tiles, so unless you want to build an unimpressive structure with the word shnerpf next to it, move on.\nPenny: Hey, let\xe2\x80\x99s light a fire.\nAmy: Ooh, that sounds cozy.\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I\xe2\x80\x99ve lit a real fire before.\nSheldon: Ah, it\xe2\x80\x99s basic thermodynamics. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure we can figure that out.\nLeonard: I could stack the logs conically to facilitate airflow.\nSheldon: That would maximize oxygen for optimal combustion.\nLeonard: Right. So all we need is to\xe2\x80\xa6\nPenny: Got it.\nLeonard: A scientist made that.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s house.\nHoward: Look, Raj, you\xe2\x80\x99re my best friend in the world and I really appreciate your enthusiasm about the baby.\nRaj: Please, my pleasure.\nBernadette: And, of course, Howie and I both want you to be a part of all this.\nHoward: But we have to set some boundaries.\nRaj: I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand.\nHoward: The three of us aren\xe2\x80\x99t having this baby. Just the two of us.\nHoward: Oh. Okay. Yeah, I get it. I\xe2\x80\x99ll back off.\nHoward: Thanks for understanding.\nRaj: Of course. I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you guys some space. Let me just get this out of your way.\nHoward: You need some help?\nRaj: No, I got it.\nBernadette: Raj, Raj, wait.\nRaj: Please, Bernadette. Let me leave with my dignity.\nScene: The cabin.\nPenny: Hey, you guys want to play a drinking game?\nSheldon: Oh, well now, we\xe2\x80\x99ll never win. You always play the drinking game.\nPenny: Not the drinking game, a drinking game.\nLeonard: To be fair, good at both.\nAmy: What\xe2\x80\x99s the game?\nPenny: All right, it\xe2\x80\x99s called Never Have I Ever. The rules are simple. Someone says something they\xe2\x80\x99ve never done, but if you have done it, you take a drink.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99ve never played that before.\nSheldon: Hey, now, wait. Have we started? Do I drink? What is happening?\nPenny: Okay. Calm down. I\xe2\x80\x99ll go first. All right, let\xe2\x80\x99s see. Never have I ever\xe2\x80\xa6\nAmy: She\xe2\x80\x99s trying to think of something she\xe2\x80\x99s never done before. This could take a while.\nPenny: Very funny. Okay, never have I ever\xe2\x80\xa6 yeah, you know what? Let\xe2\x80\x99s just circle back.\nLeonard: Okay, I\xe2\x80\x99ll go. Never have I ever been arrested.\nSheldon: So I drink.\nAmy: No, it\xe2\x80\x99s only if you\xe2\x80\x99ve done it.\nSheldon: Got it.\nAmy: I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe you\xe2\x80\x99ve been arrested.\nSheldon: I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe Penny hasn\xe2\x80\x99t.\nPenny: Sheldon, what did you do?\nSheldon: Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not proud of it, but I jaywalked.\nLeonard: Oh, no, it\xe2\x80\x99s like a horror movie. We\xe2\x80\x99re trapped in a cabin with a maniac.\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99m surprised you would do that.\nSheldon: No, I crossed in the middle of the street. And normally, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t, but I saw an aggressive-looking Girl Scout, and it was the heart of cookie season. Anyway, there was a police officer, and he witnessed the whole thing.\nPenny: What, he arrested you for that?\nSheldon: No, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t do anything. So I said, you just saw me jaywalk, why aren\xe2\x80\x99t you doing your job? You know? May, maybe I should arrest you for, for impersonating a police officer.\nPenny: And then you got arrested.\nSheldon: Oh, and how.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s house.\nHoward: I feel like I just made a horrible mistake.\nBernadette: Yeah.\nHoward: But on the other hand, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t kick him out of our lives. I just asked him to back off a little.\nBernadette: Yeah.\nHoward: What? Are you gonna cry?\nBernadette: Yeah.\nHoward: Is it baby hormones or actually sad?\nBernadette: I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell anymore.\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99ll go get him.\nBernadette: And bring back the bear.\nScene: The cabin.\nLeonard: This game\xe2\x80\x99s dangerous. I could get you in trouble.\nPenny: How?\nLeonard: Well, never have I ever used Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s toothbrush to clean the sink.\nPenny: Fine, is that how you want to play this? All right, never have I ever come up with a nickname for my own genitals.\nLeonard: Never should\xe2\x80\x99ve told you about Alvin and the Chipmunks.\nAmy: Okay. My turn. Um, never have I ever completely rocked my girlfriend\xe2\x80\x99s world in bed.\nSheldon: Amy.\nAmy: You know the rules. Drink.\nPenny: Yeah, go ahead.\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99s right.\nSheldon: All right, my turn. Mm. Oh, I know. Never have I ever kept a secret bank account, because I think my wife can\xe2\x80\x99t handle money. Did I win? I feel like I won.\nPenny: I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe this. You realize I make more money than you?\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t, I know, but this isn\xe2\x80\x99t a big deal. It\xe2\x80\x99s just a little savings I put aside.\nPenny: We\xe2\x80\x99re married. We\xe2\x80\x99re supposed to share everything.\nLeonard: What, you mean, like, your massive credit card debt?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m calling it. I won.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s house.\nRaj: I appreciate the apology, but it\xe2\x80\x99s really not necessary. I overstepped my bounds.\nHoward: No, Raj, you\xe2\x80\x99ve been great. I just, I need to start doing my part around here.\nBernadette: I hear that.\nRaj: Well, if that\xe2\x80\x99s the case, is there anything I can do to help?\nHoward: Well, not right now. But we could try out that microphone you got us, and listen to the baby\xe2\x80\x99s heartbeat.\nRaj: Really? It\xe2\x80\x99s okay if I listen with you?\nBernadette: Of course.\nRaj: Can I squirt the ultrasound jelly on your stomach?\nHoward: Hey, look at that. It\xe2\x80\x99s weird again.\nScene: The cabin.\nLeonard: Okay, you have every right to be mad. And what you said is true. You do make more money than me. So I had no right to do what I did. And I\xe2\x80\x99m so sorry. I hope you can forgive me.\nPenny: How long have you had this secret account?\nLeonard: A couple years, but I just put a few bucks aside every month for emergencies.\nPenny: Well, how much you got in there?\nLeonard: Six thousand four hundred and twenty seven dollars. Forty seven dollars once my nana\xe2\x80\x99s birthday check gets here.\nPenny: My God, Leonard, do you know what I could do with that kind of money?\nLeonard: No, I do, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why I hid it.\nPenny: What good is it if you don\xe2\x80\x99t use it?\nLeonard: Uh, you have shoes you love, but never wear. I have money I love, but never spend. We\xe2\x80\x99re kind of a cute couple that way. Again, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have kept it a secret.\nPenny: Well, I have a secret I\xe2\x80\x99ve been keeping from you, too.\nLeonard: Is it a secret bank account? Because that would be awesome.\nPenny: I hate my job.\nLeonard: Really? Why?\nPenny: Because I don\xe2\x80\x99t feel good flirting with doctors for sales. I mean, I know I make a lot of money. But I haven\xe2\x80\x99t been happy for a while.\nLeonard: Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you tell me?\nPenny: Because I know how important it is to you that I\xe2\x80\x99m having some success.\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99s not true.\nPenny: Okay, really? So you\xe2\x80\x99d be fine if I went back to acting and waiting tables again?\nLeonard: If that\xe2\x80\x99s what you want to do, yes.\nPenny: Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s not what I want to do.\nLeonard: Oh, yes.\nPenny: Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter what I want. Look, this job is gonna get me out of debt. So I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna do the grown-up thing and see it through.\nLeonard: Well, that is the grown-up thing.\nPenny: I guess.\nLeonard: I love you.\nPenny: I love you, too.\nLeonard: You know, never have I ever made love in the forest while it was raining.\nPenny: Well, guess I gotta drink.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s house.\nHoward: All right, here we go.\nBernadette: I\xe2\x80\x99m not hearing anything.\nHoward: Well, give me a second.\nRaj: Are you sure you can do this?\nHoward: Hey, who found four dollars and change on the beach with his metal detector?\nRaj: I buried it there, so we could go home.\nBernadette: Wait, that\xe2\x80\x99s it.\nRaj: Wow.\nBernadette: Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that the best?\nRaj: You guys made a person.\nHoward: We did.\nRaj: And I like to think I helped.\nHoward: You didn\xe2\x80\x99t.\nScene: The cabin.\nSheldon: Oh, never have I ever drunk milk past its expiration date.\nAmy: Never have I ever cancelled a dentist appointment.\nSheldon: Oh, uh, never have I ever put my foot in the ocean.\nAmy: Never have I ever honked if I liked anything.\nSheldon: Oh, uh, never have I ever thrown, caught or touched a Frisbee.\nAmy: Never have I ever put salt on my food without trying it first.\nSheldon: Oh. Never have I ever pushed all the buttons in an elevator.\nAmy: Well, we all have a past.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
