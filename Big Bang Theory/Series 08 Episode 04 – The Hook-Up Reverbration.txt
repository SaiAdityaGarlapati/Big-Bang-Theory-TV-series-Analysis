b'Scene: The cafeteria.\nLeonard: Have you guys heard about this research team that\xe2\x80\x99s trying to transgenically manipulate chicken DNA to create some sort of chicken dinosaur?\nSheldon: Oh, I think that sounds wonderful.\nHoward: What? You\xe2\x80\x99re afraid of both dinosaurs and chickens.\nSheldon: Yes, but tell me a dinosaur chicken salad sandwich wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t hit the Mesozoic spot.\nRaj: Hey, guys.\nHoward: Hey.\nSheldon: Hello.\nRaj: We still on for tomorrow night?\nLeonard: Yeah. I\xe2\x80\x99m excited to finally meet your girlfriend.\nSheldon: Speaking of which, according to a recent study out of Oxford University, when someone takes on a new romantic partner, that person loses one or two close friends.\nHoward: Since when do you read social science?\nSheldon: I go to the bathroom like everybody else.\nRaj: Why would I lose friends just because I started dating someone?\nLeonard: Yeah, you didn\xe2\x80\x99t lose anyone when you met Amy. Yeah, well, no, this study refers to romantic partners. Not the way I would categorize the two of us.\nRaj: You guys kiss and hold hands.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen him do it. It\xe2\x80\x99s not romantic.\nRaj: Look, I\xe2\x80\x99m not the kind of guy who drops his friends just because he\xe2\x80\x99s in a relationship.\nLeonard: What happens if she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like us?\nRaj: Well, hey, you\xe2\x80\x99re my dear friends. You\xe2\x80\x99ll get a Christmas card for a couple of years, and then you\xe2\x80\x99re dead to me.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The apartment.\nAmy: So, Howard, is Stuart still living with your mom?\nHoward: I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to talk about it.\nBernadette: But he\xe2\x80\x99s going to.\nHoward: My mom got him cable. In my whole life, growing up in that house, no cable. Do you know how many HBOs that leech had my mother get him? Seven. Seven HBOs. Seven.\nBernadette: Long story short, they have seven HBOs.\nRaj: Hey, guys.\nSheldon: Hello.\nRaj: Emily, you know almost everybody here.\nEmily: Hi.\nRaj: And this is Leonard, this is Penny.\nEmily: Oh, it\xe2\x80\x99s so nice to meet you.\nLeonard: Nice to finally meet you, too.\nPenny: Hi.\nEmily: Hello.\nLeonard: Wow, Raj, you were not lying about her.\nRaj: I told you she exists.\nPenny: Hey, I hear you\xe2\x80\x99re a dermatologist.\nEmily: Uh, yeah, I\xe2\x80\x99m a resident at Huntington Hospital.\nSheldon: Oh, I like their emergency room. Yeah, even if it turns out you don\xe2\x80\x99t have Dengue fever, they still let you take a lollipop.\nBernadette: You know, Penny just started training to be a pharmaceutical sales rep. Maybe she can practice on you some time.\nPenny: Oh, it would be great to practice on a real doctor.\nEmily: Yeah. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that\xe2\x80\x99d be fine.\nSheldon: I have some odd freckles on my buttocks. Can I make an appointment for you to look at them?\nEmily: Um, okay, I guess.\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99m with him three years, nothing. She\xe2\x80\x99s with him two minutes, and he\xe2\x80\x99s taking his pants off.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nBernadette: Last night was fun. What did you think of Emily?\nPenny: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I kind of got the sense she didn\xe2\x80\x99t like me.\nBernadette: Did she say she didn\xe2\x80\x99t like you?\nPenny: Of course not. No one ever says they don\xe2\x80\x99t like you straight to your face.\nAmy: We have led different lives.\nBernadette: You guys just met. Why would she feel that way?\nPenny: It\xe2\x80\x99s just this vibe I got.\nBernadette: I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you\xe2\x80\x99re worried about nothing.\nPenny: Yeah. You\xe2\x80\x99re probably right. I used to think my high school P.E. teacher didn\xe2\x80\x99t like me, but it turned out, she liked me a little too much.\nBernadette: Really?\nPenny: Yeah. It was fine. We went to a Melissa Etheridge concert, I got an A, it all worked out.\nBernadette: When you go to Emily\xe2\x80\x99s office to practice, you\xe2\x80\x99ll see. It\xe2\x80\x99s fine.\nPenny: Yeah, I hope you\xe2\x80\x99re right.\nAmy: You really went your entire life without anyone saying I hate you to your face?\nPenny: Yeah.\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99d say it now, but look at those cheekbones.\nScene: Capital Comics.\nSheldon: I miss Stuart\xe2\x80\x99s place. All this loud music and exposed brick. What, is this a comic book store, or a rave at the third little pig\xe2\x80\x99s house?\nHoward: Yep, I wish Stuart would reopen. I hate this place, too.\nLeonard: Okay, him I believe because he\xe2\x80\x99s an 80-year-old man in a 15-year-old\xe2\x80\x99s tee shirt. But you\xe2\x80\x99re just upset about Stuart and your mom and all their HBOs.\nHoward: Yes, I am. You know, I can\xe2\x80\x99t even watch Game of Thrones now without thinking of mother saying, Stuart, which one is Thrones?\nRaj: You know, he might not reopen. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t get a lot of money from the insurance company.\nSheldon: Oh, boy, if there is one thing that gets my goat, it\xe2\x80\x99s those dad-gum insurance companies.\nLeonard: Why? Because they won\xe2\x80\x99t get off your lawn? Is Stuart trying to get a loan, or, or find investors?\nHoward: All I know is, he\xe2\x80\x99s got my mother buying four-ply toilet paper. I mean, four-ply. If his butt is so delicate, why doesn\xe2\x80\x99t he just use an angora rabbit?\nSheldon: For starters, they shed and bite.\nLeonard: Hey, here\xe2\x80\x99s a thought. Why don\xe2\x80\x99t we put up the rest of the money that Stuart needs?\nRaj: So, we\xe2\x80\x99d be, like, owners of a comic book store?\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s kind of a dream come true.\nHoward: That does sound fun.\nRaj: Ooh, maybe we could come up with a business plan to compete with this place.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you a plan right now. Step one, open comic book store. Step two, start rumour this comic book store gives you genital warts. Step three, buy a big bag to put the money in.\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s not that bad.\nScene: Emily\xe2\x80\x99s surgery.\nPenny: Hey.\nEmily: Hi.\nPenny: Thank you so much for letting me practice my sales pitch on you. I really appreciate it.\nEmily: Sure.\nPenny: Um, I brought coffee. I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure what you like, so I got a regular, a cappuccino and a Chai tea. Since you like Raj, I thought you might be into that.\nEmily: Thanks. If we could get started. I\xe2\x80\x99m a little busy.\nPenny: Oh, yeah, sure. Let me just get out my materials. Leonard gave me this briefcase. He used to carry it around in high school. You can still see the dent where they whacked him with it. Okay, I would like to talk to you about our new birth control pill, Femevra.\nEmily: Great.\nPenny: So, Femevra\xe2\x80\x99s triphasic design provides balanced hormonal exposure.\nEmily: All right.\nPenny: It has also been shown to cause significantly fewer side effects than other oral contraceptives. Although it can cause acne, which, if you ask me, kind of increases its effectiveness as a contraceptive.\nEmily: Funny.\nPenny: Okay, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. Did we get off on the wrong foot? Because since the other night, I kind of feel like you might have a problem with me.\nEmily: No, it\xe2\x80\x99s fine.\nPenny: Are you sure, because it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem fine?\nEmily: Okay. If you really want to talk about this, I do have a problem.\nPenny: Oh, my God. Tell me, what did I do?\nEmily: Look, it\xe2\x80\x99s nothing. It\xe2\x80\x99s just, Raj told me that a while ago, you two hooked up.\nPenny: What? Oh, why would he say that?\nEmily: Did it not happen?\nPenny: Well, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t exactly call it a hook-up.\nEmily: Did you kiss?\nPenny: Yeah.\nEmily: Were you naked?\nPenny: Yeah.\nEmily: So, it was a hook-up.\nPenny: No. Yeah.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: So, what are some ways we could set our comic book store apart from the competition?\nLeonard: Oh, kids buy comic books. It would be great to figure out a way to get more kids in the store.\nHoward: You know, when I was a kid, I loved going there, but I could never get a ride.\nRaj: Ooh, what if we got a van and drove around and picked kids up?\nSheldon: Nice. You mean, like at parks and schools?\nHoward: Toy stores, puppet shows.\nLeonard: Hold on. So, your idea is to get a van and cruise the streets looking for kids to pick up?\nSheldon: Yes.\nLeonard: And are you gonna use candy to lure them in?\nRaj: We are now.\nPenny: You told Emily we hooked up?\nRaj: Um, well, in my defence, I tell everybody.\nPenny: Why would you say that?\nRaj: We were having a conversation about past lovers.\nPenny: We weren\xe2\x80\x99t lovers. Come on. Everyone knows we didn\xe2\x80\x99t sleep together. We got drunk and fooled around. Why couldn\xe2\x80\x99t you just leave me out of it?\nRaj: Well, we were being honest. You would leave me out of the conversation with the next guy if you dumped Leonard?\nLeonard: Why say it?\nPenny: Yes.\nRaj: Well, I would never leave you off my list, and not just because, without you, we\xe2\x80\x99re playing fast and loose with the word list.\nPenny: Well, good job. Now she hates me. Ugh.\nRaj: Great.\nSheldon: On the bright side, that Oxford study was right. One friend down. I wonder who you\xe2\x80\x99re going to lose next.\nRaj: You, okay? It\xe2\x80\x99s you. You\xe2\x80\x99re, you\xe2\x80\x99re next.\nSheldon: No. You\xe2\x80\x99re crazy about me.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nPenny: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what Emily\xe2\x80\x99s so upset about anyway. Even if I had slept with him, so what? Everyone has a past.\nAmy: Hmm-hmm.\nPenny: Almost everyone has a past.\nBernadette: Come on, look how pretty you are. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure this isn\xe2\x80\x99t the first girl to hate you.\nPenny: It\xe2\x80\x99s not.\nBernadette: And I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you can turn it around.\nPenny: How? You can\xe2\x80\x99t force someone to like you.\nAmy: What if you just hang around and act like her friend until you wear her down? I mean, next thing you know, you\xe2\x80\x99re in her home, you\xe2\x80\x99re eating her food, drinking her wine.\nPenny: No, that won\xe2\x80\x99t work.\nAmy: You\xe2\x80\x99re right. Cheers.\nBernadette: Oh, I know. Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you use your sales training to go back down there and sell yourself?\nPenny: What?\nBernadette: Yeah. But instead of selling a drug, you\xe2\x80\x99d be selling Penny. it\xe2\x80\x99s cute.\nPenny: It\xe2\x80\x99s stupid.\nBernadette: Well, maybe people would like you more if you didn\xe2\x80\x99t crap all over their ideas.\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna go with Penny on this one. Then again, why wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t I? I mean, we go way back.\nPenny: Oh, my God. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t used to like you.\nAmy: Shh. Amy\xe2\x80\x99s here now.\nScene: Capital Comics.\nSheldon: You know, the more I think about it, the more intrigued I am about having our own store.\nHoward: We\xe2\x80\x99ll get to see all the new stuff before it hits the shelves.\nSheldon: And we\xe2\x80\x99ll get to have fun interactions with our customers. Like, this isn\xe2\x80\x99t a library, buy it or get out.\nHoward: You say things like that all the time.\nSheldon: Yes, but as a store owner, I\xe2\x80\x99ll finally have a good comeback to, You don\xe2\x80\x99t work here, shut up.\nLeonard: Uh, do you know how Penny told Raj he should have left her off his list?\nHoward: Yeah.\nLeonard: Well, do you think when she and I had that conversation, she left people off her list?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m sure she did.\nLeonard: Why?\nSheldon: Because if she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t, she\xe2\x80\x99d still be wading through the list.\nLeonard: Will you stay out of this?\nSheldon: If only Penny had said that once in a while.\nHoward: Hey, what difference does it make? You\xe2\x80\x99re the one she wants to marry.\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99s true.\nHoward: Yeah, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure that complete honesty is always the best thing for a relationship.\nSheldon: Yeah, he\xe2\x80\x99s right. Once, in a moment of candour, I told Amy that her hair reminded me of a duck caught in an oil spill. She stormed out. Which was sad, because we were playing Scrabble, and I had all the letters to spell persimmon.\nLeonard: Why are you even part of this conversation? You don\xe2\x80\x99t know anything about women.\nSheldon: I know that if I had a wife or a fianc\xc3\xa9e, I\xe2\x80\x99d ask her first before I invested money in a comic book store.\nHoward: He\xe2\x80\x99s right.\nSheldon: Yeah, well, of course I am. I was also right about her hair. It did everything but quack.\nScene: The stairwell.\nLeonard: There\xe2\x80\x99s something I wanted to run past you.\nPenny: What\xe2\x80\x99s up?\nLeonard: Mm, the guys and I were thinking about investing in Stuart\xe2\x80\x99s comic book store. Is that okay?\nPenny: Why are you asking me?\nLeonard: Well, you know, we\xe2\x80\x99re engaged, and it\xe2\x80\x99s kind of a big deal financially. It seems like something we should talk about.\nPenny: Oh. Well, would you consider mounds of credit card debt kind of a big deal financially?\nLeonard: Yeah.\nPenny: Huh.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nHoward: Mm. So, me and the guys were talking about this great investment opportunity.\nBernadette: Nope.\nHoward: But you didn\xe2\x80\x99t hear what it was.\nBernadette: I know.\nHoward: Oh, come on.\nBernadette: Fine. What is it?\nHoward: It\xe2\x80\x99s to help reopen the comic book store.\nBernadette: Nope.\nHoward: Well, hear me out.\nBernadette: Howard, you know we\xe2\x80\x99re saving up for a house.\nHoward: I know, but all the guys are doing it. We\xe2\x80\x99re splitting it four ways, so it\xe2\x80\x99s really not that much money.\nBernadette: It just seems like a risky investment.\nHoward: I get that. I, okay, look, the real reason this is important is, before my dad left me and my mom, he used to take me to the comic book store. It was one of the few things we did together.\nBernadette: Oh. Howie, I had no idea.\nHoward: Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t like to talk about it.\nBernadette: Oh, baby. That story\xe2\x80\x99s made up, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\nHoward: That\xe2\x80\x99s how much buying a comic book store means to me.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99d like your honest opinion on something.\nAmy: Of course.\nSheldon: Now, before I start, I need you to know that I\xe2\x80\x99m very excited about this, and anything you say that isn\xe2\x80\x99t enthusiastically supportive will throw our entire relationship into question. So, keep an open mind.\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99m feeling a little backed into a corner, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Perfect. Now, I\xe2\x80\x99m considering investing in Stuart\xe2\x80\x99s comic book store.\nAmy: Interesting. Can you see how a grown man, an accomplished scientist, who invests in a store that sells picture books about flying men in colourful underwear might be wasting both his financial and intellectual resources?\nSheldon: No.\nAmy: Then I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a terrific idea.\nSheldon: Great. Wait till you hear about our van.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nRaj: Hey.\nPenny: Hi.\nRaj: Thanks for inviting us over.\nPenny: Oh, thank you for coming.\nEmily: Uh, listen, Penny, before you start, I just want to apologise for being so rude the other day in my office.\nPenny: No, no. No need to apologise.\nRaj: Excuse me, can I say something? I just love both you guys, and I want you to get along. And when I say love I meant as a friend. And, uh, way too soon, right?\nPenny: Okay, sit down. Listen, Emily, what happened between me and Raj was a long time ago.\nRaj: It was, and I may have made it seem like a bigger deal than I should have.\nPenny: Yeah, and Leonard and I are engaged now, and I\xe2\x80\x99m just hoping we can put this whole thing behind us.\nEmily: Mm. I\xe2\x80\x99d like that, too. Yeah, I thought I\xe2\x80\x99d be okay with it, but then I saw how pretty you are.\nPenny: Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s so sweet. I mean, look at you, you are gorgeous.\nRaj: It\xe2\x80\x99s true, you\xe2\x80\x99re both gorgeous. Kind of says something about the man who could bed you both. You get why I\xe2\x80\x99ve been alone most of my adult life.\nScene: Mrs Wolowitz\xe2\x80\x99s house.\nStuart: So, what brings you by?\nHoward: Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t need a reason, it\xe2\x80\x99s my house.\nStuart: Technically, it\xe2\x80\x99s your mom\xe2\x80\x99s house, but we certainly want you to feel welcome.\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m always welcome.\nStuart: Mm, just try and call first.\nBernadette: Okay, let\xe2\x80\x99s get down to business. Howie was thinking about putting up some money to help you reopen the store, but before that happens, I have a few questions.\nStuart: Oh. I appreciate the offer, but actually your mother already gave me the money.\nHoward: What?\nStuart: Yeah. I told her it was too much, but she said she was happy to help out her bubala.\nHoward: Excuse me. Ma, you are cancelling that cheque, and Stuart is not your bubala, I\xe2\x80\x99m your bubala. You can\xe2\x80\x99t have more than one bubala.\nStuart: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know who he\xe2\x80\x99s talking to. She\xe2\x80\x99s at Target, buying me shirts.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99m so glad we could work this all out.\nPenny: Yeah, me, too.\nEmily: You know, we should have dinner one night with you and Leonard.\nPenny: Oh, we would love that.\nRaj: Great.\nPenny: Okay, good night, guys.\nEmily: All right, night.\nPenny: Bye.\nEmily and Penny (simultaneously): I hate her.\nScene: The apartment.\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99m really disappointed we\xe2\x80\x99re not gonna have our own comic book store.\nLeonard: I know. I was looking forward to it.\nSheldon: It would\xe2\x80\x99ve been so nice to have a place that was ours, where we could just sit and read comics in peace.\nHoward: With comfy seats.\nRaj: And snacks.\nSheldon: Well, I guess it was too good to be true.\nLeonard: Yeah.\nAdvertisements'
