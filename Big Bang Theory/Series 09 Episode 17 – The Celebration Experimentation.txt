b'Scene: The stairwell\nAmy: So Sheldon, there\xe2\x80\x99s something I\xe2\x80\x99ve been wanting to talk about but I know it\xe2\x80\x99s kind of a touchy subject.\nLeonard: Way to narrow it down to everything.\nSheldon: What is it?\nAmy: Well, your birthday\xe2\x80\x99s coming up, and you\xe2\x80\x99ve never let us celebrate it, and I was hoping maybe this year we could.\nSheldon: Oh, I suppose that\xe2\x80\x99s a discussion we could have.\nAmy: Okay, great, I mean, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have to be a big party or anything. I was just, where\xe2\x80\x99d he go?\nPenny: W, wait a minute. You mention his birthday and he vanishes?\nLeonard: Well, where\xe2\x80\x99s that information been this whole time?\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The apartment.\nPenny: Well, where is he?\nAmy: Sheldon?\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99ll check his room.\nSheldon: Surprise.\nPenny: Oh, my God.\nSheldon: Just one example of how birthdays can be terrible. Now, can we please drop this subject and pick a new one? I suggest how thick can a soup get before it becomes a stew? You know, the answer, it may surprise you.\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry I brought it up.\nPenny: Yeah, what is the problem? Is it about getting older?\nSheldon: Please, look at this porcelain skin. I\xe2\x80\x99m like a human sink.\nAmy: But it\xe2\x80\x99s the one day a year that\xe2\x80\x99s just all about you.\nLeonard: One day. Right.\nAmy: Can you please just tell me why?\nSheldon: Fine. As you know, I have a twin sister with whom I obviously share a birthday. Every year we\xe2\x80\x99d have a party. No one I invited would ever come, because they didn\xe2\x80\x99t like me.\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.\nSheldon: Oh, that part wasn\xe2\x80\x99t so bad. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t like them, either. But then I\xe2\x80\x99d inevitably spend the whole day being tortured by my sister\xe2\x80\x99s friends.\nPenny: Oh, poor thing.\nSheldon: When I was six, they told me Batman was coming to my party. I waited by the door for hours. Closest thing to Batman I saw was when a robin flew into the window.\nAmy: You realize none of those things would happen now?\nSheldon: I do, but why do you care if I celebrate my birthday at all?\nAmy: Well, you made my last birthday so memorable, I wanted to return the favour.\nPenny: You know, if you had a party now, you have plenty of friends that would love to come.\nLeonard: And we live here, so we have no choice.\nPenny: Yeah.\nSheldon: Very well. You may celebrate my life by throwing a party with cake, presents and a shower of admiration and love. But then you owe me big-time.\nScene: The comic book store.\nHoward: You have any idea what you\xe2\x80\x99re getting Sheldon for his birthday?\nRaj: He\xe2\x80\x99s been fascinated with dinosaurs lately. Maybe we could get him a fossil.\nLeonard: Well, just don\xe2\x80\x99t get anything Jurassic. He feels like that whole chunk of time has gone Hollywood. Hey, uh, you know, he told a sad story about how his sister tricked him into thinking Batman was coming to his party.\nHoward: That\xe2\x80\x99s funny. Let\xe2\x80\x99s do that.\nLeonard: Maybe we could get Batman to actually show up.\nRaj: You mean, some guy in a lame suit?\nLeonard: Or a real Batman. Hey, Stuart? Didn\xe2\x80\x99t you try to get Adam West to do a signing here once?\nStuart: Yeah, but there was kind of a scheduling conflict. He, uh, wanted to know when he\xe2\x80\x99d get paid. And I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t tell him.\nLeonard: Can I get his contact info?\nStuart: Sure, uh, but just so you know, he\xe2\x80\x99s kind of a diva.\nLeonard: He is?\nStuart: Oh, yeah. Won\xe2\x80\x99t take the bus. He won\xe2\x80\x99t pack his own lunch. Won\xe2\x80\x99t let you spend the night on his couch.\nScene: The apartment.\nAmy: Okay, so how do you feel about party balloons?\nSheldon: Uh, Mylar balloons, yes. Latex balloons, no. Water balloons, I will jump off the roof and aim for your car.\nPenny: All right, what about music?\nSheldon: I enjoy marching bands and Tibetan throat singing.\nPenny: No music it is.\nBernadette: What kind of cake do you like?\nSheldon: Well, my favourite is chocolate with strawberry frosting, three layers, and if there\xe2\x80\x99s writing on it, make sure it\xe2\x80\x99s not all caps. I don\xe2\x80\x99t need my dessert yelling at me.\nScene: Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s car.\nRaj: Hey, so what was Adam West like on the phone?\nLeonard: Uh, nice guy. But it was a little weird to hear Batman say don\xe2\x80\x99t ring the doorbell or my poodles will go crazy.\nRaj: You know, Adam West is my favourite Batman? Well, after Michael Keaton, Christian Bale and Batman from The Lego Movie.\nHoward: Don\xe2\x80\x99t say that to him.\nRaj: What? He beat out George Clooney, and that\xe2\x80\x99s something. Like, I love me some Clooney.\nLeonard: Don\xe2\x80\x99t say that to anyone.\nScene: The apartment.\nPenny: Thank you so much for helping us, Stuart.\nStuart: Oh, I, I was just glad to be invited. To be honest, I don\xe2\x80\x99t always feel like I\xe2\x80\x99m part of the group.\nPenny: Okay, sweetie, we\xe2\x80\x99re on the clock here. Can you hate yourself and frost at the same time?\nBarry: Hewwo, I hope I\xe2\x80\x99m not too earwy.\nBernadette: No, no, no. Come on in.\nBarry: And how is the wadiant mommy-to-be?\nBernadette: Doing great.\nStuart: You, you\xe2\x80\x99re pregnant?\nBernadette: Yeah.\nStuart: Sounds like something a member of the group might know.\nPenny: Yeah, birthday party first. Pity party later.\nScene: Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s car.\nLeonard: Are you crazy? How can you put Michael Keaton in front of Christian Bale?\nAdam West: Oh, please. Even my poodles know Bale\xe2\x80\x99s overrated.\nRaj: Thank you. That\xe2\x80\x99s why I say Keaton\xe2\x80\x99s number one. He brought a sense of humour to the role.\nAdam: Oh, if you\xe2\x80\x99re gonna factor in a sense of humour, then I should be at the top of the list. It should be me, Keaton, Kilmer, Lego, Bale, and that pretty boy Clooney.\nHoward: Really? You\xe2\x80\x99re ahead of Bale? The man who personified the words, I\xe2\x80\x99m Batman.\nAdam: I never had to say I\xe2\x80\x99m Batman. I showed up, people knew I was Batman. Everywhere I went, on the TV show, mall openings, Julie Newmar\xe2\x80\x99s bungalow.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m sold, you\xe2\x80\x99re ahead of Bale.\nAdam: There\xe2\x80\x99s another reason I should be higher on the list. All those other guys had muscles built into their costumes. All I had in my Batsuit was 100%, grade-A West.\nHoward: Can we just all agree we\xe2\x80\x99re worried about Affleck?\nLeonard: Sure.\nRaj: Yeah, of course.\nAdam: What\xe2\x80\x99s an Affleck?\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nSheldon: Is there a reason I had to leave my own apartment?\nAmy: Well, I think they just want you to see it for the first time all decorated.\nSheldon: But who\xe2\x80\x99s gonna tell them they\xe2\x80\x99re doing it wrong?\nAmy: Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure they\xe2\x80\x99ll ask you to give a speech, and that\xe2\x80\x99s when you just tear \xe2\x80\x99em a new one. Have to say, you, you do look good in that suit.\nSheldon: Oh. Thank you.\nAmy: Maybe later I\xe2\x80\x99ll, uh, get to see you in your birthday suit.\nSheldon: But this is my birthday suit. Are you having a stroke? Because that\xe2\x80\x99s the kind of thing that just ruins a birthday party.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: So, Mother, I\xe2\x80\x99m surprised you came all this way for Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s birthday.\nBeverley: Oh, I was happy to. He did come to my 60th.\nLeonard: Oh. You had a party for your 60th?\nBeverley: Oh, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t call it a party. Just a few close friends. And your sister and brother.\nPenny: You know, to be fair, we did get married in Vegas and didn\xe2\x80\x99t invite her.\nBeverley: And I never did thank you for that, dear.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nAmy: Oh. Penny says everyone\xe2\x80\x99s there. Are you ready?\nSheldon: I am. Oh. Wait.\nAmy: Are you all right?\nSheldon: No, I just, I got a little light-headed.\nAmy: Oh, do you need a minute?\nSheldon: No. No, if I can walk past that pet shop with the parrot in the window, I suppose I can do this.\nAll: Happy birthday!\nLeonard: Speech! Speech!\nRaj: Come on, Sheldon, say something.\nSheldon: Uh, um, uh, thank you all so much for coming. Beverly. Wil Wheaton. Adam West, for some reason.\nLeonard: Batman finally came to your party.\nAdam: Happy birthday, Sherman.\nSheldon: Thank you. This is all so thoughtful. Excuse me.\nAdam: I still get paid, don\xe2\x80\x99t I?\nScene: A little later.\nLeonard: Okay, I\xe2\x80\x99d better go in there and talk to him.\nAmy: Well, don\xe2\x80\x99t you think I\xe2\x80\x99m the one who should go in?\nLeonard: No offence, but I\xe2\x80\x99ve known the guy a really long time.\nAmy: Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ve, you know, seen him without pants on.\nLeonard: Again, no offence, but so have I.\nAmy: Well, he\xe2\x80\x99s seen me without pants on.\nLeonard: Again, no\xe2\x80\xa6\nPenny: Okay, this is ridiculous. (Knocking) Sheldon? Can I come in?\nSheldon: How do you know I\xe2\x80\x99m not using the facilities?\nPenny: Because you e-mail me your bathroom schedule once a week, even though I\xe2\x80\x99ve clicked unsubscribe, like, a thousand times. So, what\xe2\x80\x99s going on?\nSheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I looked around the room, and I saw all the faces and the presents, and it, it was just too much.\nPenny: I get that. Hey, you want to just bring a few people in here? You know, Wil Wheaton in the bathtub, Batman on the toilet. It\xe2\x80\x99ll be like the weirdest Comic-Con ever.\nSheldon: I know that you worked hard to put this together. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry I\xe2\x80\x99m ruining it.\nPenny: Oh, pl, you\xe2\x80\x99re not ruining it. Look, at some point, Raj will try to get everyone to do the Electric Slide. Now, that will ruin it.\nSheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I can go back out there.\nPenny: That\xe2\x80\x99s fine. You know, I hate that your sister and her friends used to torture you. But what I hate even more is, if I was there, I would have tortured you, too.\nSheldon: Based on this pep talk, I\xe2\x80\x99d say you\xe2\x80\x99re still doing it.\nPenny: My point is, there was a time I never would\xe2\x80\x99ve been friends with someone like you, and now you are one of my favourite people. So, if what you need is to spend your birthday in a bathroom, I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to do it with you.\nSheldon: Well, everyone will think I\xe2\x80\x99m weird.\nPenny: Sweetie, you are weird. Everyone knows you\xe2\x80\x99re weird, but they\xe2\x80\x99re all still here because they care about you so much.\nBarry (knocking): Hewwo. Some of us need to check our hair because we might have a shot with Weonard\xe2\x80\x99s mother.\nScene: Later.\nLeslie Winkle: Leonard.\nLeonard: Hey.\nLeslie: It\xe2\x80\x99s been a while.\nLeonard: Leslie. I can\xe2\x80\x99t remember the last time we talked. So much has changed.\nLeslie: Has it?\nLeonard: Yeah, uh, um, Penny and I got married.\nLeslie: Wow, congratulations. You know, actually, I thought you\xe2\x80\x99d be living with Sheldon forever.\nLeonard: Yeah, well, don\xe2\x80\x99t be a stranger.\nPenny: Okay, everybody, Sheldon is gonna come back out, but I think he\xe2\x80\x99s a little embarrassed, so let\xe2\x80\x99s all be extra nice, okay?\nBarry: What are you wooking at me for? I\xe2\x80\x99m a saint. But a sinner in the sack.\nSheldon: Hello, everyone. I, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to apologize for my behaviour. I hope it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t put a damper on the party. So, please, enjoy yourselves. Oh, this is quickly getting out of hand.\nAmy: If I may, I, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to propose a toast. Um, thank you all for coming tonight. I know it\xe2\x80\x99s customary for the birthday boy to receive presents, but I feel like I got the greatest gift the day he was born.\nGeneral cheers.\nSheldon: Aw, Amy, that was lovely. You know, this is fun. Let\xe2\x80\x99s do more. Someone else say something wonderful about me.\nHoward: Sheldon, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think everyone\xe2\x80\xa6\nSheldon: Wolowitz, perfect. Everyone listen to Wolowitz.\nHoward: Okay, then, uh, Sheldon, we\xe2\x80\x99ve known each other a long time. And it is a pleasure to work with you and call you my friend.\nSheldon: Little generic. Keep thinking. We\xe2\x80\x99ll circle back. Wil Wheaton, go.\nWil: Sheldon, I know that we\xe2\x80\x99ve had our ups and downs, but I can honestly say that my life is so much more interesting because you are in it. We may have met because you are a fan of Star Trek. But I have become a fan of Sheldon Cooper. Live long and prosper, buddy. And happy birthday.\nGeneral cheers.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s how you do it, Wolowitz. Now you see why he\xe2\x80\x99s famous and you\xe2\x80\x99re not.\nBeverley: Sheldon, I know the future holds great things for you, and we all can\xe2\x80\x99t wait to see what they are. Happy birthday, dear.\nGeneral cheers.\nBarry: Someone caw Animal Contwol. There\xe2\x80\x99s a cougar on the woose.\nBeverley: Barry, stop.\nLeonard: Seriously, Barry, stop.\nRaj: And it was Gandhi who said, live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever.\nSheldon: And it was Sheldon Cooper who said let\xe2\x80\x99s speed this up. A lot of people want to talk.\nLeslie: Uh, in the past, I would\xe2\x80\x99ve said something obnoxious, like, happy birthday, dumbass. But I\xe2\x80\x99m not gonna do it. You and I have both grown a lot, and it\xe2\x80\x99s just so nice to see you all again. So, happy birthday, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Oh. Oh, now, you know I hate change. Say it.\nLeslie: Happy birthday, dumbass.\nGeneral cheers.\nAdam: Happy birthday, young man. And if any of you have enjoyed seeing me here today, I\xe2\x80\x99m also available for Comic-Cons, bachelor parties, bar mitzvahs\xe2\x80\xa6\nBernadette: I can\xe2\x80\x99t think of anything to say that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t already been said, so, here\xe2\x80\x99s to you, Sheldon.\nGeneral cheers.\nSheldon: Thank you, Bernadette. That was perfect.\nHoward: What? You gotta be kidding me?\nLeonard: Sheldon, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been together so long, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to remember a time you weren\xe2\x80\x99t in my life. And believe me, I try. You make me laugh. You make me a better scientist. You make me crazy. You\xe2\x80\x99re more than just my roommate, you\xe2\x80\x99re my brother.\nSheldon: Thank you.\nLeonard: Happy birthday, buddy.\nGeneral cheers.\nSheldon: Thank you. That, that was wonderful.\nPenny: Oh, wait, wait, wait. Stuart didn\xe2\x80\x99t get to speak.\nStuart: Oh, oh, okay. Um, uh, Sheldon, I\xe2\x80\x99ve spent most of my life feeling invisible, but having you and everyone\xe2\x80\xa6\nAmy: Hey, everybody, listen up.\nPenny: You nailed it.\nAmy: We\xe2\x80\x99ve got someone who couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be here but really wanted to wish you a happy birthday.\nStephen Hawking (on Skype): Hello, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Professor Hawking.\nStephen: Happy birthday to you.\nSheldon: Thank you so much. I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe you\xe2\x80\x99re\xe2\x80\xa6\nStephen: Happy birthday to you.\nSheldon: Oh, you\xe2\x80\x99re singing. Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.\nStephen: Happy birthday, dear Sheldon.\nLeonard: Uh, Professor Hawking, if you just give us one second, we\xe2\x80\x99ll light the candles, and we can all sing together.\nStephen: I was crushing it, but all right.\nPenny: Okay, while they get the cake, Sheldon, I just want to say, I hope you didn\xe2\x80\x99t think you were gonna get through tonight without a hug.\nSheldon: You know, I used to hate these hugs. Now they\xe2\x80\x99re just extremely irritating.\nLeonard: Ready when you are, Professor Hawking.\nStephen: And a one, and a two\xe2\x80\xa6\nAll: Happy birthday to you,\nHappy birthday to you,\nHappy birthday, dear Sheldon,\nHappy birthday to you.\nGeneral cheers.\nAdam: So, who\xe2\x80\x99s taking me home?\nAdvertisements'
