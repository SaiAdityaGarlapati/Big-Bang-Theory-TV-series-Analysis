b'Scene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Well, I must say, Leonard, when I first heard your idea for Giant Jenga, I was sceptical.\nLeonard: I can\xe2\x80\x99t blame you. Tiny Twister was a complete bust.\nSheldon: No, I was wrong. The looming threat of being crushed under a pile of lumber does add a certain spice. I\xe2\x80\x99ve never felt so alive. (Answers door) Oh, hello, Alex. Uh, let me go get you last night\xe2\x80\x99s recordings.\nLeonard: What recordings?\nSheldon: Well, you remember when you told me I talk in my sleep? Well, it occurred to me that, like most things I say, it\xe2\x80\x99s probably pure gold. So I started recording it all, and now Alex gets to comb through eight hours of what I like to call Sheldon After Dark.\nAlex: Hey, Leonard.\nLeonard: Hey. Just playing a little Giant Jenga here.\nAlex: Oh, I know, I\xe2\x80\x99m the one who had to buy him the helmet. So, do you have any plans this weekend?\nLeonard: Well, most of Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s gonna be figuring out where to put this game when we\xe2\x80\x99re done. How about you?\nAlex: Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna go see Kip Thorne give a lecture on subatomic space-time.\nLeonard: Ooh. That\xe2\x80\x99s his take on John Wheeler\xe2\x80\x99s quantum foam. That should be great.\nAlex: Well, if you want, you can come with me.\nLeonard: Ah, I\xe2\x80\x99d love to, but I\xe2\x80\x99m supposed to hang out with Penny.\nAlex: Well, bring her.\nLeonard: Well, she\xe2\x80\x99s not really into that kind of stuff.\nAlex: Yeah, okay. Well, if you want to hear about the lecture, I can tell you all about it at work, or, you know, over dinner sometime.\nLeonard (jumping and knocking over the Jenga): What?\nSheldon: Jenga, I win!\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The cafeteria.\nHoward: Oh, come on, that can\xe2\x80\x99t be true.\nRaj: I did the research. Tony the Tiger, Dig\xe2\x80\x99em the Frog, Cap\xe2\x80\x99n Crunch, Toucan Sam, Count Chocula, Trix the Rabbit, Snap, Crackle and Pop. Not one cereal mascot is a girl. It\xe2\x80\x99s a total breakfast sausage fest.\nLeonard: Are we done with this?\nRaj: Almost. Franken Berry, Boo Berry, Sugar Bear and the Honey Nut Cheerio bee, I believe his name is Buzz.\nLeonard: Terrific. Something weird happened and I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to do about it.\nHoward: What\xe2\x80\x99s going on?\nLeonard: Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s assistant asked me on a date last night.\nRaj: How could you do that to me? You know I\xe2\x80\x99ve been working it with Alex for weeks.\nLeonard: Working it? You can\xe2\x80\x99t even talk to her.\nRaj: I talk with my eyes.\nHoward: You look like my little cousin when he\xe2\x80\x99s dropping one in his diaper.\nLeonard: She knows I have a girlfriend. It\xe2\x80\x99s so weird.\nRaj: Oh, my God. You\xe2\x80\x99re loving this.\nLeonard: To my bones. I mean, I\xe2\x80\x99m not gonna do anything about it. I love Penny. It\xe2\x80\x99s just nice to have a young, attractive woman sniffing around the goods.\nRaj: I both hate you and want to be you. This is Ryan Gosling all over again.\nSheldon: Ah, gentlemen, what is on the conversational menu this morning?\nRaj: Leonard stole my woman, and he knew full well I was only six to eight months away from making my move.\nLeonard: I didn\xe2\x80\x99t steal anyone.\nRaj: Your assistant is totally hitting on this jerk and he loves it.\nSheldon: Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s not acceptable. I mean, I\xe2\x80\x99m her boss. She needs to be solely focused on my needs, not distracted by your pasty, androgynous brand of sexuality.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m androgynous?\nSheldon: Oh, please. Look at you with your pouty bee-stung lips.\nLeonard: What do you guys think I should do?\nRaj: I say you tell Alex your heart belongs to Penny, I provide her a shoulder to cry on, and then roughly half a year later I give it to her good.\nScene: Amy\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nSheldon: I want to thank you all for coming on such short notice. Uh, in the past, I\xe2\x80\x99ve reached out to each of you individually, but I believe my present situation requires the collective wisdom of the group, which as you can see from your commemorative T-shirts I have dubbed Sheldon Cooper\xe2\x80\x99s Council of Ladies.\nPenny: What is happening?\nSheldon: I need your advice about a delicate workplace situation. Uh, to protect those involved, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be changing their names.\nBernadette: Who\xe2\x80\x99s involved?\nSheldon: Well, a short, bespectacled colleague of mine who lives in the shadow of his brilliant roommate. Let\xe2\x80\x99s call this colleague Ricardo Shilly-Shally.\nPenny: You\xe2\x80\x99re talking about Leonard.\nSheldon: No, no, Shilly-Shally has red hair and, uh, he briefly served in the Mexican Navy. Anyway, despite the fact that he has a girlfriend, Shilly-Shally has been the recipient of inappropriate workplace flirtations from a young lady.\nAmy: It\xe2\x80\x99s your assistant Alex, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\nSheldon: No. No. No. This is Tondelaya della Ventimiglia.\nPenny: Wait, what the hell\xe2\x80\x99s going on with Leonard and Alex?\nSheldon: No, uh, no, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. Who\xe2\x80\x99s talking about Leonard and Alex?\nPenny: Fine. Ricardo and Tondelaya.\nSheldon: Okay, look, it\xe2\x80\x99s not really about Ricardo and Tondelaya. It is really about her boss, who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t quite know how to handle this situation and could use your advice, which is surprising because Dr. Einstein Von Brainstorm, he\xe2\x80\x99s usually pretty smart about these things.\nPenny: I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna kill her.\nBernadette: I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you\xe2\x80\x99ve got nothing to worry about. Leonard would never cheat on you.\nAmy: She\xe2\x80\x99s right. But say the word, I got a lab full of cocaine-addicted monkeys with nothing to lose. One of them could end up in the backseat of her car. Or her shower.\nSheldon: Ladies, ladies, please. We\xe2\x80\x99re not here to talk about Penny, okay? We\xe2\x80\x99re here to talk about me. Uh, I mean Einstein Von Brainstorm. Oh, darn it! All right, I guess the cat\xe2\x80\x99s out of the bag. Let me explain what\xe2\x80\x99s going on. Ricardo is really Leonard.\nPenny: We know what\xe2\x80\x99s going on, Sheldon!\nSheldon: Well, what should I do?\nBernadette: Well, Alex is your employee. If she\xe2\x80\x99s doing something that\xe2\x80\x99s making Leonard uncomfortable, you should talk to her.\nSheldon: Oh, no, he\xe2\x80\x99s not uncomfortable at all. No, he\xe2\x80\x99s loving it. Yeah, he\xe2\x80\x99s strutting around like he\xe2\x80\x99s five-foot-six.\nPenny: What? He\xe2\x80\x99s loving it?\nBernadette: Sheldon, you need to talk to Alex right away.\nSheldon: Talk to her? That\xe2\x80\x99s all you\xe2\x80\x99ve got? With a cool name like Sheldon Cooper\xe2\x80\x99s Council of Ladies, I really expected more. Give me back the T-shirts.\nScene: Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s office.\nSheldon: Alex, check my schedule. What does my afternoon look like?\nAlex: I think it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty wide open. Oh, wait. Here\xe2\x80\x99s something at four o\xe2\x80\x99clock. Give Alex a talking to?\nSheldon: Well, that snuck up on us, didn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\nAlex: Is there a problem?\nSheldon: Let\xe2\x80\x99s not call it a problem. Let\xe2\x80\x99s call it an opportunity. To solve a serious problem.\nAlex: What did I do?\nSheldon: You don\xe2\x80\x99t know? Oh, you poor dear. Your ovaries are squirting so much goofy juice into your brains you don\xe2\x80\x99t even know which way is up. You made an inappropriate sexual advance towards Dr. Hofstadter.\nAlex: What? I didn\xe2\x80\x99t make a sexual advance on anybody.\nSheldon: Now, there\xe2\x80\x99s no need to get defensive. I\xe2\x80\x99m not unsympathetic to your plight. My father used to say that a woman is like an egg salad sandwich on a warm Texas day.\nAlex: What?\nSheldon: Full of eggs and only appealing for a short time.\nAlex: This conversation is making me uncomfortable.\nSheldon: Yeah, you and me both, sister. Now, please understand, I don\xe2\x80\x99t hold you responsible for your behaviour because, see, from an evolutionary standpoint, you\xe2\x80\x99re a slave to your desire to reproduce. But during the work day, when you feel possessed by amorous intent, may I suggest that you suppress it by leafing through this illustrated book of sexually transmitted diseases? Let\xe2\x80\x99s see here. Oh, yes. Check out this oozy doozy.\nAlex: I have to go.\nSheldon: So does this fellow, but he can\xe2\x80\x99t without it burning like hot soup.\nScene: The stairwell.\nLeonard: Hey, pretty lady.\nPenny: Oh, you seem extra happy.\nLeonard: Uh, I guess I am.\nPenny: Any particular reason why?\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, just having a good day. This morning Sheldon fell asleep on the way to work, so I got to listen to the radio. That was pretty crazy.\nPenny: Mm-hmm. Anything else?\nLeonard: Mm. I found this quiz online called Which Star Trek Character Are You? and it only took me four tries to get Captain Kirk.\nPenny: That\xe2\x80\x99s great.\nLeonard: Oh. It. Was.\nPenny: Hmm. Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m glad you\xe2\x80\x99re having such a great day.\nLeonard: Yeah. And the one thing that could make it even better is an evening with my special girl.\nPenny: Oh, and who\xe2\x80\x99s that?\nLeonard: What do you mean?\nPenny: Oh, I just didn\xe2\x80\x99t know if you meant me or Alex.\nLeonard: Um, why would I mean Alex?\nPenny: Because I know she hit on you and I know you liked it.\nLeonard: What?\nPenny: Don\xe2\x80\x99t play dumb with me, Ricardo Shilly-Shally!\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m missing something. (Enters apartment. To Sheldon) Did you say something to Penny about Alex?\nSheldon: Oh, yes. Yeah, and a fat lot of good it did me. All she did was get mad at you.\nLeonard: Why would you do that?\nSheldon: I needed advice about a woman. I would have asked you, but if the last few years have proven anything, it\xe2\x80\x99s that you can\xe2\x80\x99t tell a uterus from a unicycle.\nLeonard: At least I know not to blab to a girl about somebody flirting with her boyfriend.\nSheldon: Good to know. Yeah, a few more helpful hints like that, you may find yourself on the Council of Ladies. (Answering phone) Hello. I see. Uh, what time? Very well, then. Huh. That was the Human Resources Department at the university. Apparently, my assistant Alex has filed a complaint accusing me of inappropriate behaviour in the workplace.\nLeonard: Oh, my God, what did you do?\nSheldon: Hmm, let me think. Nothing. I\xe2\x80\x99m a delight.\nScene: The Human Resources Department.\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Human Resources Department. (Knock, knock, knock) Human Resources Department. (Knock, knock, knock) Human Resources Department.\nHR Woman: Come in.\nSheldon: Hello.\nHR Woman: Ah, Dr. Cooper, have a seat.\nSheldon: Thank you.\nHR Woman: I called you in today because your assistant Alex Jensen has lodged a complaint against you.\nSheldon: So I\xe2\x80\x99ve been told. But I can\xe2\x80\x99t understand what she has to complain about. I mean, she has a front-row seat as I make scientific history. There\xe2\x80\x99s string cheese in my mini-fridge, and that\xe2\x80\x99s for anyone. Yeah, and just yesterday I led her away from a life of sexual promiscuity by making her look at pictures of disease-ridden genitalia.\nHR Woman: Cancel my next appointment. This is gonna take a while. Dr. Cooper, you said things to your employee that you just cannot say in the workplace.\nSheldon: Like what?\nHR Woman: Well, according to Ms. Jensen, you said that she was a slave to her biological urges and called her an egg salad sandwich. I don\xe2\x80\x99t even know what that means, but I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna go ahead and tell you you can\xe2\x80\x99t say it.\nSheldon: Oh! I see the confusion here. No, no, Alex thought I was singling her out. No. I meant that all women are slaves to their biological urges, you know? Even you. You\xe2\x80\x99re a slave.\nHR Woman: I\xe2\x80\x99m a what?\nSheldon: Well, y-you, I-I\xe2\x80\x99m just saying, you know, at a certain point in a woman\xe2\x80\x99s menstrual cycle\xe2\x80\xa6\nHR Woman: Whuh-ah! Woah! You can\xe2\x80\x99t talk about that, either, Dr. Cooper. Your language is entirely inappropriate, and I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna advise that you shut your mouth right now.\nSheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t see why I\xe2\x80\x99m the one being persecuted here. Dr. Hofstadter, he was bragging about his sexual desirability to anyone who would listen. You know, and Howard Wolowitz, he spent two years using university resources building a six-breasted sex robot. Oh, and at the office Christmas party, I heard Rajesh Koothrappali refer to you several times as Brown Sugar.\nHR Woman (writing): Hofstadter\xe2\x80\xa6 Wolowitz\xe2\x80\xa6 and the last one was Rajesh Koothrappali?\nSheldon: Yes. No, yeah, but in his defense, that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t racist. He\xe2\x80\x99s also brown.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment. Penny answers the door. Leonard is playing his cello outside.\nLeonard (singing): I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry Alex hit on me, hit on me, hit on me. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry Alex hit on me, I\xe2\x80\x99d no idea I\xe2\x80\x99m cute.\nPenny: Oh, damn it, you are.\nLeonard: Please forgive me. I should have told you about Alex.\nPenny: I don\xe2\x80\x99t care about Alex. Fine, I care. Okay, I hate that bitch. But what really hurt is that you liked it so much. I mean, do I need to be worried?\nLeonard: Of course not. No. Why?\nPenny: Because, she is pretty and smart, and when you talk about work, she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have to go home and look up words in the dictionary to understand what you said.\nLeonard: You do that?\nPenny: No.\nLeonard: Hang on. Are you feeling insecure? Because that\xe2\x80\x99s my thing, and if you take it away, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what I\xe2\x80\x99m bringing to this relationship.\nPenny: Yes, Leonard, I am insecure. Happy?\nLeonard: No, I\xe2\x80\x99m not happy.\nPenny: Why are you smiling?\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. I just never think of you having feelings like that.\nPenny: Well, I do.\nLeonard: Why? Nothing is ever going to happen between me and Alex.\nPenny: Good.\nLeonard: Come here. Tell you a secret?\nPenny: What\xe2\x80\x99s that?\nLeonard: With all these women chasing me, I kind of do feel like Captain Kirk.\nPenny: Can I tell you a secret?\nLeonard: Sure.\nPenny: Keep talking about Captain Kirk, and we\xe2\x80\x99re all gonna stop.\nLeonard: Message received. Ah, excuse me. (Answering phone) Hello. This is Dr. Hofstadter. Okay. All right, thank you. That\xe2\x80\x99s weird. I\xe2\x80\x99m getting called in to Human Resources.\nPenny: What did you do?\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s kitchen.\nHoward: Huh. I just got called in to Human Resources.\nBernadette: Why?\nHoward: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\nScene: Raj\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nRaj: Huh. That is so strange. Human Resources wants to talk to me tomorrow. (To his dog) Could you stop licking your ass for two minutes? I have a problem here.\nScene: Human Resources department.\nHoward: Do you really think you should be drinking right now?\nRaj: How else am I supposed to talk to the Human Resources lady?\nHoward: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Seek professional help?\nRaj: I did. The guy at the liquor store said this stuff tastes great in coffee.\nHoward: Wait, you got called in, too? What is going on?\nLeonard: Sheldon threw us all under the bus.\nHoward: Oh.\nRaj: I feel like I\xe2\x80\x99ve been called down to the principal\xe2\x80\x99s office. Although I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t mind if Brown Sugar suspended me. From a sex swing. This may have been a mistake.\nHoward: Relax. Everything\xe2\x80\x99s gonna be fine. Before I met Bernadette I was in here every other day. Uh, little tip, turn off your I Like Big Butts ringtone before you go in.\nRaj: Well, this is all your fault.\nLeonard: How is this my fault?\nRaj: If you weren\xe2\x80\x99t screwing around with Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s assistant, none of this would be happening.\nLeonard: I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t screwing around with anyone.\nRaj: Oh, of course not. She was just sniffing around your goods because she was hunting for truffles.\nHR Woman: Ah, Mr. Wolowitz, it\xe2\x80\x99s been a while.\nHoward: Hey, Janine. How are Tom and the kids?\nJanine: Fine. You must be Dr. Hofstadter.\nLeonard: Yes, but I think this is all a big misunderstanding.\nRaj: Yeah, yeah, me, too. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t do anything.\nJanine: Is that alcohol on your breath?\nRaj: Howard built a sex robot.\nHoward: That is not true. All I did was build a robot.\nJanine: Did it have six breasts?\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, I\xe2\x80\x99m a feminist, I don\xe2\x80\x99t notice things like how many breasts a robot has.\nSheldon: Well, hello.\nLeonard: What are you doing here?\nSheldon: Actually, I came to speak to Mrs. Davis.\nJanine: And I\xe2\x80\x99m a little busy right now.\nSheldon: But I came to file a complaint. Somebody has made me feel uncomfortable in the workplace by using language of an inappropriate and sexual nature.\nJanine: And who was that?\nSheldon: You, you dirty birdie. I-I thought about the things you said to me yesterday, and I realized I\xe2\x80\x99m deeply offended. Now, be a dear and get me one of those complaint forms.\nJanine: That\xe2\x80\x99s it. All of you, in my office now!\nSheldon: And thanks to you, I know better than to ask if you\xe2\x80\x99re menstruating. And based on your behaviour, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have to.\nScene: Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s office.\nSheldon: It has been pointed out to me that some of the things I said to you could be construed as offensive, and I would like to offer you my sincerest apology.\nAlex: Thank you, Dr. Cooper.\nSheldon: Yeah, additionally, you should know that the university has mandated that I take an online sexual harassment seminar so this sort of thing doesn\xe2\x80\x99t happen in the future.\nAlex: Okay.\nSheldon: Yeah. Now, unfortunately, uh, my time is much too valuable to waste on nonsense like this, so, um, I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna need you to take it for me. Oh, and, uh, you\xe2\x80\x99d better ace it, they\xe2\x80\x99re pretty mad.\nScene: The apartment.\nPenny: So, hey, I was thinking about that stuff with Alex.\nLeonard: Oh, would you stop worrying about that?\nPenny: I can\xe2\x80\x99t help it. But, look, I figured I could sit around and feel insecure, or I could do something about it. So I got a course catalogue at school and looked at some of the science classes.\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99s great.\nPenny: No, it isn\xe2\x80\x99t, they are extremely boring. I mean, how do you not kill yourself, like, every day? Anyway, I decided I don\xe2\x80\x99t need to be a scientist, I could just look like one. So I bought these.\nLeonard: Glasses? I really don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x99s gonna change\xe2\x80\xa6 oh, my God, you look so smart and hot.\nPenny: I know, right? Watch this. Molecules.\nLeonard: Okay, come with me.\nPenny: Where are we going?\nLeonard: To my bedroom, so I can take everything off but those glasses. And maybe the boots.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
