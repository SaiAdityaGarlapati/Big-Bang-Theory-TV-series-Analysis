b'Scene: The apartment.\nRaj: Knight to queen\xe2\x80\x99s bishop-five.\nHoward: Oh, very nice. What\xe2\x80\x99s Leonard going to do? Does he give up the pawn or does he give up the position?\nRaj: Let\xe2\x80\x99s find out. Leonard, ready?\nLeonard: Ready.\nRaj: Go. (Leonard sprays an aerosol which lights up laser beams. He tries to negotiate the beams as Howard and Raj sing dramatic music. Eventually he touches one of the beams and a buzzer sounds.)\nLeonard: Damn it. I slipped.\nHoward: Too bad. You know the rules of Secret Agent Laser Obstacle Chess. Uh, Leonard died again, Sheldon. You\xe2\x80\x99re up.\nSheldon: Despite my deep love of chess, lasers and aerosol disinfectant, I must forfeit.\nLeonard: Why?\nSheldon: \xe2\x80\x93 Because it\xe2\x80\x99s almost eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\nLeonard: So?\nSheldon: So, Penny has a don\xe2\x80\x99t knock on my door before eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock  or I punch you in the throat rule.\nAll: Ah.\nHoward: Hey, you know what\xe2\x80\x99d be a great idea? We get some girls over here and play Laser Obstacle Strip Chess.\nLeonard: Believe me, Howard, any girl who would be willing to play that, you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to see naked.\nHoward: You underestimate me.\nScene: Outside Penny\xe2\x80\x99s door. Sheldon stands looking at his watch with his hand poised to knock. At the right moment he starts knocking.\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Penny, (knock, knock, knock) Penny, (knock, knock, knock) Penny.\nPenny: Hey, Sheldon.\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s eleven am.\nPenny: I know. You\xe2\x80\x99re safe.\nSheldon: This package came while you were at work.\nPenny: Oh, great, my rhinestones. Thank you.\nSheldon: Excuse me.\nPenny: What?\nSheldon: You have to sign this.\nPenny: What is it?\nSheldon: When I signed for the package, I was deputized by the United Parcel Service and entrusted with its final delivery. I now need you to acknowledge receipt of the package so that I\xe2\x80\x99m fully indemnified and no longer liable.\nPenny: Sheldon, it\xe2\x80\x99s just a box of rhinestones.\nSheldon: Well, the contents are irrelevant. A legal bailment has been created. Does that mean nothing to you?\nPenny: It means nothing to anybody. Come here, let me show you what I\xe2\x80\x99m doing.\nSheldon: Bailment describes a relationship in common law where a physical possession of personal property, or chattels, is transferred from one person, the bailor, to another person, the bailee.\nPenny: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Look, look, look! I started a business.\nSheldon: Obviously, not a cleaning business.\nPenny: No, I\xe2\x80\x99m making flower barrettes. See? I call them Penny Blossoms. I made one for myself, then all the girls at work wanted one. Then I showed some to this lady who runs a shop in Old Town. She sells cards and homemade jewellery. She said she wanted to sell them. I said okay, and in one week, I made a $156.\nSheldon: Good for you. Sign here.\nPenny: Sheldon, don\xe2\x80\x99t you get it? If this takes off, I won\xe2\x80\x99t have to be a waitress anymore.\nSheldon: But then who will bring me my cheeseburger on Tuesday nights?\nPenny: Another waitress.\nSheldon: What\xe2\x80\x99s her name?\nPenny: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\nSheldon: And you\xe2\x80\x99re going to let her handle my food?\nPenny: Nancy. Her name is Nancy.\nSheldon: I think you\xe2\x80\x99re just making that up.\nPenny: Sheldon, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry about your hamburger, okay? I just don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be a waitress for the rest of my life.\nLeonard: Cheeseburger. I get a cheeseburger.\nPenny: Fine, cheeseburger.\nSheldon: Maybe I\xe2\x80\x99d be better off with Nancy.\nPenny: So, what do you think? I mean, this could be a business, right?\nSheldon: How many of these can you make a day?\nPenny: About twenty.\nSheldon: And how much profit do you make per Penny Blossom?\nPenny: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, like, 50 cents. I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure.\nSheldon: No, Of course you\xe2\x80\x99re not. All right, ten dollars a day times five days a week times 52 weeks a year is two thousand six hundred dollars.\nPenny: That\xe2\x80\x99s all?\nSheldon: Before taxes.\nPenny: Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have to pay taxes on this stuff.\nSheldon: I believe the Internal Revenue Service would strongly disagree. But, if you took advantage of modern marketing techniques, and you optimized your manufacturing process, you might be able to make this a viable business.\nPenny: And you know about that stuff?\nSheldon: Penny, I\xe2\x80\x99m a physicist. I have a working knowledge of the entire universe and everything it contains.\nPenny: Who\xe2\x80\x99s Radiohead?\nSheldon: I have a working knowledge of the important things in the universe. Good luck.\nPenny: Sheldon, hold on. Could you maybe show me how to make more money with this?\nSheldon: Of course I could.\nPenny: Sheldon, wait! Will you?\nSheldon: Just to be clear here, you\xe2\x80\x99re asking for my assistance.\nPenny: Yes.\nSheldon: And you understand that will involve me telling you what to do?\nPenny: I understand.\nSheldon: And you\xe2\x80\x99re not allowed to be sarcastic or snide to me while I\xe2\x80\x99m doing so.\nPenny: Okay.\nSheldon: Good. Let\xe2\x80\x99s begin with the premise that everything you\xe2\x80\x99ve done up to this point is wrong.\nPenny: Oh, imagine that.\nSheldon: Sarcasm. Good-bye.\nPenny: No, sorry. Wait! Please come back!\nCredits sequence.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment. Penny is making a barette. Sheldon is timing her.\n  Penny: There. Done.\nSheldon: All right. 12 minutes and 17 seconds.\nPenny: Pretty good, right?\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s 4.9 Penny Blossoms per hour. Based on your cost of materials and your wholesale selling price, you\xe2\x80\x99ll effectively be paying yourself\xe2\x80\xa6 $5.19 a day.\nPenny: A day?\nSheldon: There are children in a sneaker factory in Indonesia who outearn you.\nPenny: That just can\xe2\x80\x99t be right.\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re questioning my math?\nPenny: No, sorry.\nSheldon: Want me to show my work?\nPenny: Oh, God, no, no. Just please tell me what to do about it.\nSheldon: All right, are you familiar with the development that resulted from Honor\xc3\xa9 Blanc\xe2\x80\x99s 1778 use of interchangeable parts? The assembly line, of course.\nPenny: Okay, you know what, if I\xe2\x80\x99m not allowed to be snide, you\xe2\x80\x99re not allowed to be condescending.\nSheldon: That wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a part of our original agreement, and I do not agree to it now.\nPenny: All right, fine. How are we supposed to set up machines and conveyor belts in my apartment?\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re thinking of the moving assembly line, an understandable but not excusable mistake. No. The moving assembly line, that was introduced by Henry Ford in 1908. That innovation is what made possible our modern consumer culture by enabling a low-unit cost for manufactured goods. I guess that isn\xe2\x80\x99t one of the topics discussed on your Radiohead.\nScene: The apartment\n  Leonard: Let\xe2\x80\x99s go. We\xe2\x80\x99re going to miss the coming attractions.\nRaj: What\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\nHoward: I think I bruised a testicle capturing that last pawn.\nFrom Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment they hear Penny and Sheldon singing \xe2\x80\x9cBlow the man down.\xe2\x80\x9d They enter to find Sheldon and Penny working together on the barettes.\n  Leonard: Hello?\nPenny & Sheldon together: Hello. (They resume singing and working)\nLeonard: W-W-Wait, what\xe2\x80\x99s going on?\nSheldon: I assume you\xe2\x80\x99re referring to the sea shanty. It\xe2\x80\x99s a rhythmic work song designed to increase productivity.\nPenny: Yeah, it\xe2\x80\x99s crazy, but it totally works. Look, we made this Penny Blossom in under three minutes.\nLeonard: Terrific, but that kind of raises more questions than it answers.\nSheldon: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s making hair accessories. I\xe2\x80\x99m helping her optimize her manufacturing process. All right, break\xe2\x80\x99s over. (They start singing again.)\nHoward: Hold on. What are you using as a bonding agent?\nSheldon: Hot glue.\nHoward: You\xe2\x80\x99re kidding. Any of the cyanoacrylates would do a better job.\nSheldon: It won\xe2\x80\x99t work, the flower\xe2\x80\x99s too porous.\nLeonard: What if we infused the bottom layer with silicone-RTV to provide a better mounting surface?\nSheldon: Intriguing.\nHoward (after Raj whispers to him): Good question, what are you marketing and distribution channels?\nPenny: Well, there are the waitresses at my work, and this cute, little shop in Old Town.\nSheldon: Hush, hush, hush, hush, hush, virtually non-existent. I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking that we set her up with a hosted turnkey e-commerce system to start.\nHoward: Why not eliminate the middle man? We could install a small server farm with a static IP in her bedroom.\nLeonard: She\xe2\x80\x99d need some kind of industrial cooling system.\nSheldon: Of course, but before we set up a marketing and distribution infrastructure, we should finish optimizing the manufacturing process. To start with, she has a terrible problem with moisture-induced glitter clump.\nPenny: Yeah, it\xe2\x80\x99s a bitch.\nHoward: Uh, I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen this before.\nLeonard: Where?\nHoward: It\xe2\x80\x99s a common stripper problem. They dance, they sweat, they clump.\nPenny: Ew.\nLeonard: Are you thinking about adding a desiccant like calcium sulphate?\nHoward: Actually, I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking about this one stripper named Vega. But sure, calcium sulphate could work.\nSheldon: Let\xe2\x80\x99s think out of the box for a moment. How about a molecular sieve?\nLeonard & Howard: Oh!\nPenny: I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a spaghetti strainer in the kitchen.\nSheldon: Wow.\nLeonard: Hey, we could liberate some micro-porous charcoal from the chem lab.\nSheldon: Oh, great. Raj, why don\xe2\x80\x99t you and Howard go get the charcoal? Leonard, why don\xe2\x80\x99t you start working on some preliminary Web site designs. I\xe2\x80\x99ll make some space in our apartment so we can move the manufacturing process.\nPenny: Well, what\xe2\x80\x99s wrong with my apartment?\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s not my apartment.\nPenny: Wait, wait, what am I going to do?\nLeonard: Uh, hey, it\xe2\x80\x99s your business. Do whatever you want.\nPenny: Oh, okay, cool. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to take a nap.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m still tweaking things a little bit, but this will give you the general idea of the Web site. So, what do you guys think?\nHoward (after Raj whispers to him): Uh, pretty much any way I say that is going to hurt his feelings.\nLeonard: Okay, what\xe2\x80\x99s wrong with it?\nSheldon: \xe2\x80\x93 What\xe2\x80\x99s wrong with it?\nLeonard: Not you. I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t asking you. Penny?\nPenny: Uh, well, it\xe2\x80\x99s a little juvenile. I mean, it kind of looks like the MySpace page of a 13-year-old girl.\nLeonard: No, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t.\nHoward: Please. Dateline could use it to attract predators.\nSheldon: Penny, this is your enterprise, so it\xe2\x80\x99s ultimately your decision, but based on the quality of his work, I\xe2\x80\x99d strongly recommend that we let Leonard go.\nLeonard: You want to fire me?\nSheldon: What I want is irrelevant. This is Penny\xe2\x80\x99s decision. Penny?\nLeonard: Excuse me, but if I did such a bad job then why do we already have orders?\nPenny: We do?\nLeonard: Uh-huh. Look. Mrs. Fiona Fondell from Huntsville, Alabama has ordered two.\nPenny: No kidding. Two?\nLeonard: Uh-huh. Look at the comments.\nPenny: Thank you, Penny Blossoms. These will be perfect to cover my bald spot. Aww, that is so sweet.\nSheldon: Camouflaging bald spots. That\xe2\x80\x99s primarily a male concern. Perhaps we could expand our market.\nPenny: How are flower barrettes going to appeal to men?\nHoward: We add Bluetooth!\nSheldon: Brilliant. Men love Bluetooth.\nPenny: Wait a minute, wait a minute, you want to make a hair barrette with Bluetooth?\nSheldon: Penny, everything is better with Bluetooth.\nLeonard: Holy crap. Someone just ordered a thousand Penny Blossoms.\nPenny: Get out! Who needs a thousand sparkly flower barrettes with rhinestones?\nLeonard: The Fifth Annual East Rutherford, New Jersey, Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender Alliance Luau.\nSheldon: Oh, another market to expand into, balding gay men.\nHoward: And I\xe2\x80\x99ll bet lesbians love Bluetooth.\nSheldon: We should get to work.\nPenny: Wait, wait, wait, why does it say one-day rush? Since when do we offer a one-day rush?\nLeonard: Amazon offers one-day rush.\nPenny: Yeah, but they don\xe2\x80\x99t have to glue the books together. How the hell are we going to make a thousand Penny Blossoms in one day?\nLeonard: Don\xe2\x80\x99t yell at me. I\xe2\x80\x99m not manufacturing. I\xe2\x80\x99m just Web design.\nPenny: Okay, well, I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna have to call them and cancel the order.\nSheldon: Excuse me, but was this not your goal? Financial independence through entrepreneurial brilliance and innovation? My brilliance and innovation, of course, but still.\nPenny: I just don\xe2\x80\x99t see how see can pull this off.\nSheldon: Okay, that, right there, that equivocation and self-doubt, that is not the American spirit. Did Davy Crockett quit at the Alamo? Did Jim Bowie?\nHoward: They didn\xe2\x80\x99t quit. They were massacred by, like, a gazillion angry Mexicans.\nSheldon: Alright, let me put it this way. Your gross receipts on this one order will be over $3,000 for one night\xe2\x80\x99s work.\nPenny: You guys get started.\nLeonard: What are you doing?\nPenny: Going online to buy shoes!\nScene: The same, later. Sheldon and Penny are making barettes, singing \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99ll be coming round the mountain.\xe2\x80\x9d\nRaj: You know, if I wanted to spend my Saturday nights doing this, I could have stayed in India.\nHoward: Oh, stop with the fake third world crap. Your father\xe2\x80\x99s a gynaecologist, and you had a house full of servants.\nRaj: We only had four servants. And two of them were children.\nLeonard: How are we doing?\nRaj: We have 128 assorted Penny Blossoms ready to ship.\nHoward: Oh, God, we\xe2\x80\x99re never gonna finish in time. Who made Sheldon the boss anyway?\nSheldon: I believe I\xe2\x80\x99m hearing some negativity on the factory floor.\nPenny: So?\nSheldon: Penny, the labour force is a living organism that must be carefully nurtured. Any counterproductive grumbling must be skilfully headed off by management. Observe. Hey! Less talk, more work!\nPenny: Nicely done.\nSheldon: Thank you. You hear any union talk, you let me know.\nTime shift\nLeonard (singing): Someone\xe2\x80\x99s in the kitchen with Dinah\xe2\x80\xa6\nHoward (reluctantly singing): Someone\xe2\x80\x99s in the kitchen I know-ow-ow-ow\nPenny (singing): Someone\xe2\x80\x99s in the kitchen with Dinah\xe2\x80\xa6 Sheldon? Sheldon! (nudges him)\nSheldon (waking up, singing): \xe2\x80\x98Cause I sold my soul to the company store.\nPenny: Honey, do you want some coffee?\nSheldon: No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t drink coffee.\nPenny: Come on, but if you don\xe2\x80\x99t stay awake we\xe2\x80\x99ll never finish in time.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, coffee\xe2\x80\x99s out of the question. When I moved to California, I promised my mother that I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t start doing drugs.\nPenny: Leonard, help.\nLeonard: Sheldon, we still have 380 of these things to make.\nSheldon: I have complete faith that you will make them. Good night.\nPenny: Leonard?\nLeonard: Yeah, no. But, Sheldon, without your insight and leadership this entire enterprise will surely fail.\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re right, of course.\nPenny: Here, this will help.\nSheldon: Very well, but if this leads to opiates or hallucinogenics, you\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to answer to my mother.\nTime shift\nSheldon: Look at Planck\xe2\x80\x99s Constant. People say it\xe2\x80\x99s arbitrary. It could not be less arbitrary. If it varied even slightly, life as we know it would not exist. Bam! Now, now, let\xe2\x80\x99s reconsider the entire argument, but with entropy reversed and effect preceding cause, so you are thinking of a universe that\xe2\x80\x99s not expanding from the centre, no, it is retreating from a, from a possibility space. Bam! This is a space where we are all essentially Alice through the looking glass, standing in front the Red Queen, and we\xe2\x80\x99re being offered a cracker to quench our thirst. Bam! Of course, in another universe, let\xe2\x80\x99s call it universe prime, there\xe2\x80\x99s another Sheldon, let\xe2\x80\x99s call him Sheldon prime\xe2\x80\xa6\nPenny: We should have let him go to bed.\nLeonard: Bam.\nTime shift\nLeonard: I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe we actually did it.\nHoward: 1,000 friggin\xe2\x80\x99 Penny Blossoms.\nPenny: I just want you guys to know I am really grateful for your help, and for every dollar I make, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to give you 20 cents.\nHoward: That\xe2\x80\x99s your entire profit margin.\nPenny: Oh. Then never mind.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99ll print out the shipping label. Uh-oh.\nPenny: What?\nLeonard: We got an e-mail from the East Rutherford, New Jersey, Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender Alliance. They want another thousand Penny Blossoms.\nPenny: Really?\nLeonard: One-day rush. I really need to take that off the Web site.\nPenny: Okay, well. Guess we\xe2\x80\x99d better get started.\nHoward: You can\xe2\x80\x99t be serious.\nPenny: Come on. What about the living organism of the workforce and the American spirit and Jiminy Crockett at the Alamo?\nLeonard: Davy Crockett. Jiminy Crockett was a cricket.\nPenny: Yes, yes, I know that, okay? I\xe2\x80\x99m tired, I\xe2\x80\x99ve had like 18 cups of coffee. The point is, if we all just pull together, we can do this. Who\xe2\x80\x99s with me?\nHoward: Penny, although you may find it hard to believe, we do have lives.\nPenny: Leonard?\nLeonard: Sorry. My apologies to the gay community of East Rutherford, New Jersey.\nSheldon (entering dressed as The Flash): Zoom, zoom, zoom! Where\xe2\x80\x99s the coffee?\nPenny: We\xe2\x80\x99re all out.\nSheldon: No problem. I\xe2\x80\x99ll be back before this banana hits the ground. Zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom! Zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom!\nScene: The apartment. Raj is negotiating the laser beams. Sheldon and Howard are singing dramatically.\n  Raj (reaching the other side): Yes! (He takes a slice of pizza)\nHoward: Sorry, guys, but Secret Agent Laser Obstacle Lunch is just stupid.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
