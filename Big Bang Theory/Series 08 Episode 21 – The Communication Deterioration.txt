b'Scene: The cafeteria.\nSheldon: Hey, would you like to hear some songs I\xe2\x80\x99ve rewritten to get children interested in the hard sciences?\nHoward: Sure.\nLeonard: Really?\nHoward: Yeah. Well, I like music, I like science, I like making fun of Sheldon. Hit it.\nSheldon: There was a scientist who had a theory and James Clerk Maxwell was his name-o. J-A-M-E-S, C-L-E-R-K space M-A-X-W-E-L-L, And James Clerk Maxwell was his name-o. There was a scientist who had a theory and James Clerk Maxwell was his name-o, A-M-E-S\xe2\x80\xa6\nLeonard: Uh, okay, okay. Uh, we, we get it.\nSheldon: Perhaps you\xe2\x80\x99d prefer this one. The itsy bitsy spider is not an insect at all, because it haseight legs and two body parts.\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99s pretty cool, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Thank you. Do either of you know Beyonc\xc3\xa9? I\xe2\x80\x99d love her to get behind it.\nRaj: Hey.\nLeonard: Hey.\nHoward: Hey.\nSheldon: Hello.\nRaj: You guys know the new Discovery class missions that NASA\xe2\x80\x99s been working on?\nLeonard: Yeah.\nRaj: Well, they\xe2\x80\x99re looking to include a message from Earth in case one of them is encountered by alien life.\nLeonard: Oh. When I encountered alien life, I discovered that the key thing was not to sit in its spot.\nSheldon: All right, you can\xe2\x80\x99t breathe our air without an inhaler, he\xe2\x80\x99s allergic to Earth nuts, but I\xe2\x80\x99m the alien.\nRaj: Anyway, I\xe2\x80\x99m among a handful of scientists that have been asked to submit a design proposal for the message and its delivery system.\nSheldon: Excellent.\nHoward: Good for you.\nLeonard: Congratulations.\nRaj: And I was wondering if any of you guys would like to help me do it.\nLeonard: Are you kidding? Yes. What did you have in mind?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you exactly what you should do, avoid the presumption of the Terran sensory input paradigm.\nHoward: Yeah, absolutely. You need a device capable of delivering information across a wide range of perceptual modalities.\nSheldon: Any intelligent organism would at the very least need the ability to locate the position of objects in space. So the ideal interstellar lingua franca would be haptic.\nHoward: Ooh, how about a 3-D tactile communicator rigged for cross-sensory transposition?\nRaj: Exactly what I expected. Two people forcing their ideas on me and only one gentleman who could be bothered to ask me what my thoughts were. You two are out. Congratulations, Leonard, you\xe2\x80\x99re on the team.\nLeonard: My mommy raised a gentleman.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: Raj\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nRaj: Hey. Thanks for coming by.\nLeonard: Yeah. I\xe2\x80\x99m excited to help.\nRaj: I would have included the others, but you know exactly what would\xe2\x80\x99ve happened. They would\xe2\x80\x99ve taken over the project and bossed us around.\nLeonard: I get it. Uh, just this morning, Sheldon wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t let me put almond milk on my Grape-Nuts because he said it was a theoretical nut conflict.\nRaj: You should have told him to mind his own business.\nLeonard: Yeah. That\xe2\x80\x99s better than what I did say, which was, fine, I\xe2\x80\x99ll eat them with club soda.\nRaj: What makes them think they\xe2\x80\x99re always in charge of everything?\nLeonard: Mmm, they\xe2\x80\x99re alpha males.\nRaj: Huh, what does that make us?\nLeonard: We could be betas. They\xe2\x80\x99re second in charge.\nRaj: Okay, that sounds good.\nLeonard: Or we could be omegas. They get pushed around by the alphas and the betas.\nRaj: Okay, that sounds like us.\nLeonard: Whatever. There\xe2\x80\x99s no alphas here, and this is your project. You\xe2\x80\x99re in charge. How do you want to start?\nRaj: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. How do you want to start?\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Should we call Sheldon and Howard?\nRaj: No. We can do this by ourselves.\nLeonard: Okay. Great. How do you want to start?\nRaj: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. How do you want to start?\nScene: The hallway.\nPenny: (Knock, knock, knock) Sheldon. (Knock, knock, knock) Sheldon. (Knock, knock, knock) Sheldon.\nSheldon: I bet that started off as a joke, but by the third one you realized there was something strangely enjoyable about it.\nPenny: Yeah, I kind of want to do it again.\nSheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t recommend it. You\xe2\x80\x99ll be doing it the rest of your life. Anyway, if you\xe2\x80\x99re looking for Leonard, he\xe2\x80\x99s with Koothrappali.\nPenny: Uh, no, I actually came to talk to you.\nSheldon: How nice. Here are some topics that interest me, quantum mechanics, trains, flags.\nPenny: No, no. It\xe2\x80\x99s about my acting career.\nSheldon: Oh, sorry. That\xe2\x80\x99s not on the list.\nPenny: Well.\nSheldon: Oh, wait. No. How about we split the difference and discuss why Austria was an archduchy and not just a regular duchy.\nPenny: Okay, look, here\xe2\x80\x99s the thing. I like pharmaceutical sales, it\xe2\x80\x99s going great, but I have an audition for a movie, and if I get it, it could screw everything up.\nSheldon: Hmm. I know exactly what you should do. Unfortunately, I cannot tell you.\nPenny: Well, why?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m attempting to turn over a new leaf. Earlier today, it was pointed out to me that I tend to force my ideas on people.\nPenny: You\xe2\x80\x99re really not gonna tell me?\nSheldon: No, that train has left the station. Now, we can play this one of two ways. You can say, trains, tell me more, or you can just look at me like that and I\xe2\x80\x99ll start.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s house.\nBernadette: What\xe2\x80\x99s going on in here?\nHoward: I am making molecular cocktails. This sphere is actually a cosmopolitan.\nBernadette: Oh. How do you drink it?\nHoward: Oh, just put it in your mouth and pop it like a zit.\nBernadette: I think I\xe2\x80\x99ll have a beer.\nHoward: First take a picture with me.\nBernadette: Why?\nHoward: Well, Raj and I always talked about learning how to make cocktails like this together, so I taught myself and I\xe2\x80\x99m putting this on Instagram so he can see it and feel like a turd. Say cheese.\nBernadette: Is this about the space probe he\xe2\x80\x99s working on without you?\nHoward: You betcha. The very one.\nBernadette: Howard, you\xe2\x80\x99re grown men. You guys don\xe2\x80\x99t have to do everything together.\nHoward: I know. That\xe2\x80\x99s why I\xe2\x80\x99m spending tonight with you.\nBernadette: Trying to hurt Raj\xe2\x80\x99s feelings.\nHoward: With my honeybunch.\nBernadette: You\xe2\x80\x99re being childish.\nHoward: No. He is. So I have a dominant personality. We all know that.\nBernadette: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. What do we know?\nHoward: In social groupings, I just naturally wind up in charge.\nBernadette: Don\xe2\x80\x99t take this the wrong way, but how many of these little booze balls have you had?\nHoward: You don\xe2\x80\x99t think I\xe2\x80\x99m a leader?\nBernadette: I was kidding. Of course you are.\nHoward: Right. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t change if I wanted to.\nBernadette: You better not change, because I love who you are. Now, will you need help cleaning all this up when you\xe2\x80\x99re done or can you do it all by yourself?\nHoward: All by myself.\nBernadette: There\xe2\x80\x99s my big boss man.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: So, often on the front of the locomotive is a large iron wedge for clearing objects off the tracks. Now, while commonly known as a cowcatcher, I prefer the more accurate cow exploder.\nPenny: Okay. Sheldon, let me ask you a question.\nSheldon: Mmm.\nPenny: If I was at a train station and one train could take me to my current job and the other train could take me to an audition for a movie, which train should I get on?\nSheldon: Are you using trains to trick me into giving you advice?\nPenny: No.\nSheldon: All right, then. You should take a third train where you audition for the movie but hold off on making a career decision until you have more information.\nPenny: Oh. You\xe2\x80\x99re right. I\xe2\x80\x99m worried about something that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t even happened yet. Huh. You are a wise man.\nSheldon: Well, Penny, who\xe2\x80\x99s smarter, the wise man or the person who comes to him for advice?\nPenny: Oh, I guess you\xe2\x80\x99re right. Maybe it is the person who asks.\nSheldon: No, it\xe2\x80\x99s the wise man. That\xe2\x80\x99s why he\xe2\x80\x99s called the wise man. You know how I know that? I\xe2\x80\x99m the wise man.\nPenny: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. What was I thinking?\nSheldon: Uh, just out of curiosity, why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you ask Leonard for advice about this?\nPenny: \xe2\x80\x98Cause I already know what he\xe2\x80\x99ll say. Wah, wah, wah, you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do it.\nSheldon: Ah, it\xe2\x80\x99s just like he\xe2\x80\x99s here.\nScene: Raj\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nRaj: Okay, so we know that previous attempts to send a message into space, like the Golden Record on Voyager, were heavily criticized.\nLeonard: Well, aliens could only play the Golden Record if they figured out how to build a record player.\nRaj: Eh. Although, to be fair, I watched E.T. build a telephone out of a Speak & Spell and an umbrella. Dude was like a little brown MacGyver.\nLeonard: That would be more helpful if E.T. were real.\nRaj: Well, my feelings were real when he was about to die.\nLeonard: My God, when he\xe2\x80\x99s on the table and they use the paddles on him.\nRaj: And he\xe2\x80\x99s all white.\nLeonard: They zip him up in that bag.\nRaj: And Gertie can\xe2\x80\x99t stop crying.\nLeonard: The flower dies.\nRaj: Okay, let\xe2\x80\x99s talk about something else.\nLeonard: All right, so it sounds like we need a way to communicate that\xe2\x80\x99s simple.\nRaj: And doesn\xe2\x80\x99t require outside machinery to be built to access it.\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s also a problem because we don\xe2\x80\x99t even know if the aliens who find this can see. I mean, they might communicate in a totally different way than us.\nRaj: Like when my dog is mad at me, she tells me by peeing in my slippers.\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99s actually a valid example. Animals do deliver messages through scent.\nRaj: Bees talk to each other by dancing. Whales have their songs.\nLeonard: Yeah. Penny has about twenty different ways of rolling her eyes that each mean something different.\nRaj: Okay, so, what it sounds like is, what we want is a device that can deliver a message through not only sight, but other senses, as well.\nLeonard: The most basic sense that any space-faring civilization would have to possess is touch.\nRaj: Ooh. Ooh, ooh. We could make a video-playing device that simultaneously translates the information into a tactile medium.\nLeonard: All we have to do is rig up a 3-D communication system.\nRaj: We, we can totally do that.\nLeonard: I know.\nRaj: This is great.\nLeonard: Yeah, you know what else it is?\nRaj: What?\nHoward: Exactly what Sheldon and Howard said.\nRaj: Well, thank you for peeing in my slippers.\nScene: The cafeteria.\nSheldon (singing): It\xe2\x80\x99s the eye of the tiger, it\xe2\x80\x99s the ear of the bat, it\xe2\x80\x99s the whiskers of the catfish and the walrus.\nHoward: Hang on. Not that your song isn\xe2\x80\x99t terrible, it is. but how do you mention bats and leave out sonar?\nSheldon: You didn\xe2\x80\x99t let me finish. And also regarding the bat, it has sonar.\nLeonard: Hey.\nHoward: Hello.\nRaj: Look, I know you guys are upset, but we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about it, and we think it\xe2\x80\x99d be beneficial for you to be part of the project.\nHoward: Well, well, well, did you hear that, Sheldon?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. I was trying to think of what rhymes with nose of the aardvark.\nLeonard: We want you back on the project with us.\nSheldon: Well, well, well, did you hear that, Howard?\nRaj: Look, we admit it. The idea that you guys came up with was really good, and I\xe2\x80\x99d love your help.\nHoward: I suppose it couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been easy for you to say that.\nRaj: It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t, so are you in?\nSheldon: Certainly.\nHoward: Sure.\nLeonard: Great. Now that we\xe2\x80\x99re all on the same page, let\xe2\x80\x99s get together tonight and work on it.\nSheldon: Get together tonight? Leonard, stop trying to control everything, and give poor Raj a chance to come up with what we should do. Go ahead, Raj.\nRaj: Okay, I think we should do it right now.\nSheldon: Tonight works better for me.\nRaj: Okay.\nScene: A hallway.\nPenny (voiceover): Okay, it\xe2\x80\x99s just an audition. Why am I nervous? Maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing. Just means I want it. And I can have it. This feels right. Why did I ever give this up? (Out loud) I\xe2\x80\x99m starting to remember.\nScene: The apartment.\nRaj: So, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to try a technique where no one gets steamrolled. When you talk, instead of bringing up a new idea, respect what was just said by building on it.\nSheldon: Uh, building on that, we should order dinner.\nLeonard: How is that building on what he just said?\nHoward: Building on what Sheldon said, I could go for Chinese.\nRaj: Hang on. Building on what Leonard said, no one built on what I said.\nSheldon: Building on building on that, there\xe2\x80\x99s a new build-your-own pizza place on Colorado.\nLeonard: Building on that, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to remind you, I\xe2\x80\x99m lactose intolerant.\nHoward: I saw the menu. They have soy cheese.\nSheldon: Bah, you didn\xe2\x80\x99t say building on. You\xe2\x80\x99re out.\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s not Simon Says.\nRaj: Yeah, you\xe2\x80\x99re missing the point, Sheldon.\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re out, and you\xe2\x80\x99re out. I win. Who wants pizza?\nScene: The audition room.\nGirl: Penny?\nPenny: Oh, hey.\nGirl: Hey. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen you auditioning in a while.\nPenny: Yeah, uh, I got a job as a pharmaceutical sales rep.\nGirl: You quit acting?\nPenny: Well, kind of. But now I get to act like inflamed heart is only a mild side effect.\nSecond Girl: I heard you can make good money doing that.\nPenny: Yeah, it\xe2\x80\x99s going okay, but I do miss this sometimes.\nFirst Girl: Really?\nPenny: Mmm.\nFirst Girl: \xe2\x80\x98Cause I got to tell you, I am so sick of the humiliation and being treated like a piece of meat.\nAudiitoner: Chelsea?\nFirst Girl: Wish me luck.\nSecond Girl: They\xe2\x80\x99re gonna love you. I heard she\xe2\x80\x99s pushing 40 and everything\xe2\x80\x99s fake.\nPenny: Yeah. I started that rumour.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: Okay, since we agree on the delivery system for the message, maybe we should talk about what the message could be.\nRaj: Well, I think we should show what earthlings look like.\nHoward: The plaque they sent up on the Pioneer probe had a drawing of a naked man and woman on it.\nSheldon: Yeah, I never cared for that. It\xe2\x80\x99s advertising to predator races just how soft and squishy we are.\nLeonard: Squeeze yourself.\nSheldon: Oh, don\xe2\x80\x99t be offended. You know, of the four of us, you have the most veal-like consistency.\nRaj: Well, maybe there\xe2\x80\x99s a way to appear non-aggressive, but also be able to protect ourselves if necessary. Like smiling and waving with one hand, but the other hand holding the severed head of a tiger.\nHoward: You want to send a passive-aggressive message out into the universe? That\xe2\x80\x99s ridiculous.\nRaj: Oh, you mean passive-aggressive like posting pictures of you and your wife eating cosmopolitan balls that you know belong in my mouth?\nSheldon: Perhaps Howard meant passive-aggressive like asking our group to help on your project, and then only choosing Leonard.\nRaj: Look, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry I hurt your feelings, but you do have strong personalities and always end up taking over.\nHoward: It\xe2\x80\x99s not always.\nLeonard: What about when we went to Comic-Con and dressed like Jabba the Hutt? You got to be Jabba\xe2\x80\x99s head, and I got to be his fat slug butt.\nSheldon: We looked great.\nLeonard: You let a guy sit on me.\nHoward: He was dressed as Princess Leia. It made a nice picture.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m just saying, sometimes Raj and I feel pushed aside.\nRaj: Yeah. Like when you took Sheldon to Texas and showed him all around NASA, you didn\xe2\x80\x99t even think to ask me and Leonard.\nHoward: You know what? You\xe2\x80\x99re right. I should have asked you.\nSheldon: Yeah, and if he does ask you, go. It\xe2\x80\x99s amazing.\nHoward: Okay, and if we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about being left out of things, you guys went to Skywalker Ranch without us.\nSheldon: Oh, I recommend that, too. That was a magical experience.\nLeonard: Wait a minute. Sheldon spent a whole day with James Earl Jones and never told any of us.\nSheldon: I sure did. Oh, my goodness. Well, from Jabba\xe2\x80\x99s head to ice cream with Darth Vader, I\xe2\x80\x99m having a heck of a ride. Yeah, look, clearly, good things happen when I\xe2\x80\x99m in charge. Now, why don\xe2\x80\x99t you boys step aside, let me knock this project out?\nLeonard: Sheldon, you\xe2\x80\x99re not in charge. Raj is in charge.\nSheldon: Leonard, who\xe2\x80\x99s really in charge? The person in charge, or those who put him in charge?\nRaj: He\xe2\x80\x99s right. If you think about it, we\xe2\x80\x99re all in charge.\nSheldon: No, the guy in charge is in ch\xe2\x80\xa6 why is everyone so bad at these?\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nPenny: I mean, the whole experience reminded me about how much I hated about that world. You, you know, the anxiety, the depression, the negativity. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to feel those things. I want to sell drugs to people who feel those things.\nAmy: I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe you got up and walked out of an audition for a big movie.\nPenny: I did. I mean, I walked in, read for the part, then stunk up the place, but then I walked right out.\nBernadette: Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m glad you have a new appreciation for your job.\nPenny: I do, and you know, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever thanked you properly for helping me get it.\nBernadette: Properly, at all. It\xe2\x80\x99s just words I\xe2\x80\x99ve never heard.\nPenny: Well, thank you. You\xe2\x80\x99re a good friend, and you changed my life.\nBernadette: You\xe2\x80\x99re welcome. Hey, now that you\xe2\x80\x99re making some real money, maybe you can take your friend out for a nice thank-you dinner.\nPenny: Sure.\nAmy: And you probably have to invite your other friend \xe2\x80\x99cause she overheard you talking about it, and it would be awkward to exclude her.\nPenny: Okay.\nBernadette: How about now?\nPenny: All right.\nBernadette: Don\xe2\x80\x99t forget your wallet.\nPenny: I, uh, huh.\nScene: An alien spacecraft.\nSheldon (on screen): Greetings from planet Earth. Just turn left at Alpha Centauri. You can\xe2\x80\x99t miss it.\nFirst Alien: That soft pink alien looks delicious.\nSecond Alien: I could eat.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
