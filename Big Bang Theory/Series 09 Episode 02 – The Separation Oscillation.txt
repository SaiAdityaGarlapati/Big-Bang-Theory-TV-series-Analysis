b'Scene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Why are you up?\nLeonard: How am I supposed to sleep? I\xe2\x80\x99ve been married less than 24 hours, and my wife isn\xe2\x80\x99t speaking to me.\nSheldon: Perhaps you can think of this n a more positive light. In one day, you\xe2\x80\x99ve managed to do what it takes many couples decades to achieve.\nPenny (entering): Hi.\nLeonard: Hey.\nPenny: You couldn\xe2\x80\x99t sleep either?\nLeonard: Of course not.\nSheldon: Me neither. But I just had a tickle in my throat, not profound marital problems.\nLeonard: What are we gonna do?\nPenny: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\nLeonard: Please, tell me how I can fix it.\nSheldon: Glad you asked. As I see it, there\xe2\x80\x99s a simple solution. Your lips had a dalliance with the lips of another woman. It seems only logical that to restore balance to the relationship, you should find another man and dally with him. And by dally, I mean some hardcore mouth-on-mouth action.\nLeonard: Okay, that is the stupidest thing I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever heard.\nPenny: Actually, I think he\xe2\x80\x99s onto something.\nLeonard: You can\xe2\x80\x99t be serious. \xe2\x80\x98Cause I messed up and made out with a girl, you\xe2\x80\x99re gonna do the same with a random guy?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m currently single.\nPenny: That\xe2\x80\x99s true. You are.\nLeonard: What is happening?\nSheldon: I will tell you what is happening. I am saving my best friend\xe2\x80\x99s marriage.\nLeonard (waking up): U-u-u-uh!\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The apartment.\nAmy (on skype): Sheldon, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you understand how being broken up works. The only way I can sort through my feelings is if there is space between us. Every time I see you, it re-traumatizes me. I go through the pain all over again.\nSheldon: Well, hello to you, too.\nAmy: What do you want?\nSheldon: I understand we\xe2\x80\x99re no longer a couple, but I would like to remind you that we made a baby together.\nAmy: What baby?\nSheldon: A precocious little Internet show known as Fun With Flags.\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99m hanging up.\nSheldon: Great. See you in about half an hour.\nAmy: Sheldon, I am not doing Fun With Flags with you.\nSheldon: Why not?\nAmy: Because we\xe2\x80\x99re broken up.\nSheldon: Sonny and Cher made it work. Their variety show kept going long after the divorce, and here we are still talking about them.\nAmy: No one\xe2\x80\x99s talking about Sonny and Cher.\nSheldon: You must be thinking about Donny and Marie, \xe2\x80\x99cause you and I are clearly talking about Sonny and Cher.\nAmy: Sheldon, this has to stop. I know it\xe2\x80\x99s hard. It\xe2\x80\x99s hard for me, too. But I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen and talked to you more in the two days we\xe2\x80\x99ve been broken up than in the last two months that we were together.\nSheldon: Well, if you want to see less of me, maybe we should go out again.\nScene: The Comic Book Store.\nRaj: I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe you made out with Mandy Chao.\nLeonard: Well, trust me, I wish it never happened.\nRaj: And you knew about this this whole time?\nHoward: I did.\nRaj: And you didn\xe2\x80\x99t think to tell me?\nHoward: Leonard asked me to keep it to myself.\nRaj: Let\xe2\x80\x99s leave Leonard out of this for the moment. This is about you and me.\nLeonard: Wait, wait, wait, how is my day-old marriage falling apart becoming about you two?\nRaj: Hang on. What do I need to do to make you trust me?\nHoward: You think it\xe2\x80\x99s hard having one wife, try having two.\nRaj: I bet you told Bernadette all about how he was screwing around with Mandy Chao.\nLeonard: Oh, we didn\xe2\x80\x99t screw around. We just got drunk and made out.\nRaj: Whatever. It would have been nice to hear it from you.\nScene: Amy\xe2\x80\x99s apartment. Sheldon knocks three times.\nAmy: What are you doing here?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m here to return your belongings. That\xe2\x80\x99s what people who\xe2\x80\x99ve broken up do.\nAmy: And you didn\xe2\x80\x99t do your compulsive knocking ritual so I would open the door.\nSheldon: On the contrary, you no longer get to enjoy my charming eccentricities. We\xe2\x80\x99re not friends with benefits.\nAmy: Just give me the box.\nSheldon: Wait. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you want to go through it to make sure I haven\xe2\x80\x99t forgotten anything?\nAmy: Fine. My old scarf.\nSheldon: You wore it the night we went ice-skating. Remember?\nAmy: You mean the night that I went ice-skating, and you stood at the rail googling the symptoms of hypothermia?\nSheldon: We made one heck of a team, huh?\nAmy: Whose bra is this?\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s not yours? Oh, my. How embarrassing for both of us.\nAmy: It\xe2\x80\x99s Penny\xe2\x80\x99s.\nSheldon: Hey, you broke up with me. It is none of your business whose naked bosom I\xe2\x80\x99m smooshing around like pizza dough.\nAmy: Good-bye.\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. Hmm. Tables work, too. Good to know.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s kitchen.\nHoward: Ooh, brownies for girls\xe2\x80\x99 night!\nBernadette: Hands off. I\xe2\x80\x99m mad at you.\nHoward: Look, I know it\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of money, but the guy at the store said in five to seven years, it\xe2\x80\x99ll pay for itself.\nBernadette: What will pay for itself?\nHoward: Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter. What are you mad about?\nBernadette: I\xe2\x80\x99m mad at you for blabbing to me what Leonard did on the North Sea, and I\xe2\x80\x99m mad that I\xe2\x80\x99ve had to hide this from Penny for two years.\nHoward: And you have every right to be mad about those things. So, why don\xe2\x80\x99t you let me handle the credit card bill this month, huh? I mean, don\xe2\x80\x99t even look at it.\nBernadette: I mean, if Penny finds out I\xe2\x80\x99ve known all this time and haven\xe2\x80\x99t told her, she\xe2\x80\x99s gonna think I\xe2\x80\x99m a terrible friend. I wish you never told me.\nHoward: And I wish Leonard never told me. He\xe2\x80\x99s the bad guy here.\nBernadette: I guess that\xe2\x80\x99s true.\nHoward: And you let Penny marry him. Compared to that, who cares if I bought a George Clooney limited edition manscaping kit?\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard (on phone): Hi. I\xe2\x80\x99m calling about your marriage counselling services and was curious what your rate is. Really? Um, okay. Is there any kind of discount for length of marriage? \xe2\x80\x98Cause we\xe2\x80\x99re just talking hours here.\nPenny (entering): Hi.\nLeonard: Call you back. Hey.\nPenny: Can we talk?\nLeonard: I would love that.\nPenny: All right, look, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry I said I was okay with everything before we got married. I hate that we\xe2\x80\x99re going through this, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to do.\nLeonard: If you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind waiting for a Groupon, we can try marriage counselling.\nSheldon (entering): Hello.\nLeonard: Hey, uh, buddy, can we have some privacy?\nSheldon: Oh, of course. Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to intrude. This is yours.\nPenny: Okay, when I\xe2\x80\x99m done with him, I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna need more information.\nSheldon: Nothing odd. I just wanted to rub Amy\xe2\x80\x99s nose in it.\nPenny: Okay, look, I might be overreacting, but how am I supposed to get past this when I know tomorrow you\xe2\x80\x99re gonna go to work and see this woman?\nSheldon: Now, forgive me for eavesdropping, but as I see it, there\xe2\x80\x99s a simple solution.\nLeonard: Wake up, wake up, wake up.\nSheldon: Bring Penny to meet Mandy.\nLeonard: What? Why?\nSheldon: Well, right now, Penny\xe2\x80\x99s imagination is running wild, but if they meet, that will eliminate the mystery and alleviate her fears. Like when that Sparkletts guy let me look under his eye patch.\nLeonard: Uh, first of all, you made that guy cry.\nSheldon: And we learned that you don\xe2\x80\x99t need an eyeball to do that.\nLeonard: Secondly, I can\xe2\x80\x99t think of a more horrible idea than Penny meeting Mandy.\nPenny: Really? Why is that?\nLeonard: What, you actually want to meet her?\nPenny: No, but now that you\xe2\x80\x99re being weird about it, maybe I should.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m not being weird. Am I being weird?\nSheldon: Yes. And that\xe2\x80\x99s coming from me.\nLeonard: Fine, you want to meet her?\nPenny: No, I just want to know that when you\xe2\x80\x99re at work, there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing going on.\nLeonard: How many times do I have to tell you? I have no interest in this woman.\nPenny: Yeah, well, maybe she has interest in you.\nSheldon: In Leonard? Oh, even the Sparkletts guy could see that\xe2\x80\x99s unlikely.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nPenny: I guess my big problem is I never saw Leonard as the kind of guy who would do something like this.\nAmy: Anybody can make a mistake in a weak moment.\nPenny: What do you think?\nBernadette: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to think. But then again, I just found out about it.\nPenny: You know, I fell in love with Leonard because he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t anything like the guys I was used to dating. I mean, I knew those guys weren\xe2\x80\x99t above cheating because that\xe2\x80\x99s usually how we met.\nAmy: Come on, you know Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s not like that.\nPenny: I want to believe you. I really do. Am I being naive?\nBernadette: Oh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. This is all so new to me. I\xe2\x80\x99m still processing.\nPenny: You know, he never would\xe2\x80\x99ve done this when we first met. He\xe2\x80\x99s cockier now.\nAmy: That\xe2\x80\x99s because you made him more confident.\nBernadette: You know, if you think about it, without you, he never would\xe2\x80\x99ve grown into the person he is now. I mean, sure, more women might notice him, but I think it\xe2\x80\x99s better to have a guy be with you because he wants to be and not because he thinks he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have any other choice.\nPenny: I never thought about it like that.\nBernadette: Oh, me neither, not until just now.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Hello. I\xe2\x80\x99m Dr. Sheldon Cooper, and welcome to Sheldon Cooper Presents: Fun With Flags. You may notice that I\xe2\x80\x99m holding a remote control. That\xe2\x80\x99s because my cameraperson and co-host, Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler, has chosen to end her relationship with me. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to pause here to let that sink in. Okay. If you need to pause a little longer, just click the pause button. But the show must go on. And thankfully, all the things my girlfriend used to do can be taken care of with my right hand. Anyway, let\xe2\x80\x99s not spend any more time talking about her. We\xe2\x80\x99re here to talk about flags. Tonight\xe2\x80\x99s theme, flags of countries that have been torn apart and the women I have a feeling were responsible.\nScene: The cafeteria.\nLeonard: You guys have any idea how much it costs to see a marriage counsellor?\nHoward: 250 dollars an hour. Why?\nRaj: How do you know?\nHoward: Bernadette and I have occasionally gone to one to, you know, stay on top of things.\nRaj: And I\xe2\x80\x99m just hearing about this now?\nHoward: Dude, just because we\xe2\x80\x99re best friends doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that I have to tell you everything that goes on.\nRaj: You don\xe2\x80\x99t have to, you should want to.\nLeonard: Oh, great, there\xe2\x80\x99s Mandy.\nHoward: Why are marine biologists always so cute?\nRaj: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, but I\xe2\x80\x99d like to get lost in her Bermuda Triangle.\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99s not helpful.\nHoward: Then I won\xe2\x80\x99t say I\xe2\x80\x99d like to cover three-quarters of her surface area.\nLeonard: Are we done?\nRaj: Not yet, this is fun. Ooh, I know. I\xe2\x80\x99d let her free my willy. Where you going?\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna ask her if she\xe2\x80\x99d be willing to talk to Penny, tell her she has nothing to worry about.\nHoward: Leonard, wait.\nLeonard: What?\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99d like to SpongeBob her SquarePants.\nRaj: Now we are done.\nLeonard: Hey.\nMandy: Oh, hi, Leonard. What\xe2\x80\x99s up?\nLeonard: Uh, do you mind if I sit?\nMandy: Sure.\nLeonard: So, um, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been thinking a lot about you and me and the boat.\nMandy: What about it?\nLeonard: You know, what we did, when we were drunk.\nMandy: Oh, no, did I sleep with you, too?\nLeonard: No, we just made out.\nMandy: Oh. Well, good for me. So what can I do for you?\nLeonard: Uh, okay, well, um, I got married recently.\nMandy: Oh, congratulations. To Sheldon?\nLeonard: Never gets old. No, no, to a girl. Anyway, I told her what happened between you and me, and she\xe2\x80\x99s concerned about us seeing each other at work.\nMandy: It was just a kiss. Why would you even tell her?\nLeonard: Because I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want there to be any secrets between us.\nMandy: Is that really the reason?\nLeonard: What else would it be?\nMandy: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Sounds like you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to sabotage the relationship.\nLeonard: No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think so. Although, Penny did say exactly that.\nMandy: Okay, well, that\xe2\x80\x99s something to think about.\nLeonard: You know, on some level, I\xe2\x80\x99ve always believed that I don\xe2\x80\x99t deserve a woman like her.\nMandy: Oh, you\xe2\x80\x99re gonna think about that right here?\nLeonard: I mean, she\xe2\x80\x99s really beautiful. She could have any guy she wants. Which is probably why it took her so many years to tell me she loved me.\nMandy: Maybe you should talk to a therapist about this.\nLeonard: Too expensive. You\xe2\x80\x99d think I\xe2\x80\x99d be used to women withholding their love. I mean, my mother did. I mean, no matter how hard I tried, she just didn\xe2\x80\x99t have any interest in me.\nMandy: Imagine that.\nLeonard: I wonder if that\xe2\x80\x99s why I have such a dysfunctional relationship with Sheldon. I had a dream the other night that I was in a cave and I was nursing a baby, but the baby had Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s head on it.\nMandy: And your wife is worried about me?\nRaj: Hey, Leonard, when you\xe2\x80\x99re done, we came up with a bunch more.\nScene: Amy\xe2\x80\x99s apartment. Amy is watching Fun With Flags.\nSheldon (on screen): And then the Czech Republic says to Slovakia, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you understand how being broken up works. Can you believe that? You\xe2\x80\x99d think that the Czech Republic would try to hold on to what it had, given that it\xe2\x80\x99s not as young as it used to be. And I don\xe2\x80\x99t see any other countries lining up to invade its southern borders.\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna kill him.\nSheldon: But enough about the Czech Republic. Let\xe2\x80\x99s talk about the time Moldova made Romania a birthday cake and Romania said it tasted good even though it didn\xe2\x80\x99t. And yet Romania gets dumped. I\xe2\x80\x99ll pause here while you mull that one over. I know, right?\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nPenny: So, you said you had something to tell me.\nLeonard: Okay, yeah, um, do you remember when you accused me of trying to sabotage our wedding?\nPenny: Uh-huh.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99ve been thinking about it, and you might be right. But the good news is that I\xe2\x80\x99m pretty sure I know why.\nPenny: I\xe2\x80\x99m listening.\nLeonard: Penny, after all these years, I still feel like maybe I don\xe2\x80\x99t deserve you.\nPenny: Okay, that is the lamest excuse you could\xe2\x80\x99ve possibly come up with. But I get it.\nLeonard: You do?\nPenny: Yeah. Yeah, sometimes I worry you\xe2\x80\x99re gonna wake up and leave me for someone more like you.\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t even understand why you\xe2\x80\x99re with someone like me. Why would I want to be with someone like me?\nPenny: You know what I mean. And, you know, maybe the way I\xe2\x80\x99ve been reacting was me sabotaging this, too.\nLeonard: Well, how about we stop being so scared of losing each other and just be together?\nPenny: That sounds nice.\nLeonard: Good. Because I\xe2\x80\x99ve loved you since the moment we met, and I will keep loving you until the end of time.\nPenny: Oh. Oh, my God, that is the most beautiful thing anyone\xe2\x80\x99s ever said to me.\nLeonard: Yeah? That\xe2\x80\x99s because you\xe2\x80\x99re beautiful, and your beauty fills my heart with love and song.\nPenny: It\xe2\x80\x99s getting kind of cheesy, Leonard.\nLeonard: Huh? If you think that\xe2\x80\x99s cheesy, buckle up. Penny Hofstadter, will you please stay married to me?\nPenny: Oh, damn it, you topped it. Should we go to the bedroom and make this marriage official?\nLeonard: Yes, please.\nPenny: Okay.\nScene: The apartment.\nPenny: Sheldon, I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe you got us a wedding gift.\nSheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why you\xe2\x80\x99re so surprised. I watch movies, I see what people do.\nLeonard: What is this?\nSheldon: Plane tickets and hotel reservations for a weekend away in San Francisco.\nPenny: Oh.\nLeonard: Wow.\nPenny: That\xe2\x80\x99s so great.\nSheldon: Yeah, there\xe2\x80\x99s Fisherman\xe2\x80\x99s Wharf and Alcatraz and cable cars. We\xe2\x80\x99re gonna have so much fun.\nPenny: We?\nSheldon: Is there a problem?\nPenny: Oh, no, no, I just, I said, Whee.\nAmy (at door): How dare you go on the Internet and say mean things about me and compare my genitalia to part of Czechoslovakia?\nSheldon: You saw through that one, did you?\nAmy: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you were thinking, but take the video down now.\nSheldon: She watched it. I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna get that girl back.\nAmy: I only watched it because you e-mailed it to me with the subject line this is gonna make you mad.\nSheldon: She was listening through the door. She wants me.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
