b'Scene: The apartment.\n  Howard: All right, that\xe2\x80\x99s the last servo. Behold the Mobile Omnidirectional Neutralization and Termination Eradicator. Or\xe2\x80\xa6\nAll: MONTE.\nHoward: Featuring one articulated razor-sharp killing saw, one polycarbonate grinding and flipping wheel, steel armour plate exoskeleton top and bottom, and enough horsepower to drive a 110 pounds of mechanized death from zero to holy crap in 4.8 seconds.\nSheldon: Is it wrong to say I love our killer robot?\nRaj: As with my father, I both love and fear it.\nHoward: All right, enough chitchat, let\xe2\x80\x99s destroy something.\nTogether (lifting): One, two, three, go.\nRaj: Okay. What shall be first to taste the wrath of Monte?\nLeonard: Maybe we should start small.\nRaj: Okay. Ooh, perhaps today is the day we finally find out what\xe2\x80\x99s inside the Magic Eight Ball.\nSheldon: Did it when I was four. It\xe2\x80\x99s an icosahedral dye floating in tinted blue water.\nRaj: Man, call spoiler alert before you say things like that.\nLeonard: How about the toaster oven?\nSheldon: What did the toaster oven ever do to you?\nLeonard: What did I ever do to Jimmy Mullins in the third grade? He still punched me in the face with my own fists. Sorry, you little nerd, you were just in the wrong boys\xe2\x80\x99 room at the wrong time.\nHoward: Gentlemen, goggles.\nSheldon: Yeah, this is an auspicious moment. Yeah, like Robert Oppenheimer or Neil Armstrong, we need the appropriate words to mark this historic scientific event.\nRaj: How about \xe2\x80\x9cDie, toaster, die\xe2\x80\x9d?\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99ll do it.\nRaj (after watching complete destruction of toaster oven): All right, what\xe2\x80\x99s next?\nScene: The stairwell.\nPenny: No, I think I\xe2\x80\x99m just going to stay in tonight and do laundry. (Monte bursts through boys door. Penny screams and runs down the stairs.)\n  Credits sequence.\nScene: Outside in stairwell\nHoward: Oh yeah, they still got the full Monte.\nPenny: Leonard?\nLeonard: Uh-huh?\nPenny: What the hell?\nLeonard: Killer robot. We built it.\nPenny: Yeah, well, it almost killed me.\nSheldon: If it wanted to kill you, you\xe2\x80\x99d be dead.\nPenny: So, who exactly does it want to kill?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, are you unaware of the upcoming Southern California Robot Fighting League Round Robin Invitational?\nPenny: You know, since I moved last year, not all my mail has been forwarded.\nHoward: It\xe2\x80\x99s a big deal. There\xe2\x80\x99s an awards banquet and a dance afterward. Perhaps you\xe2\x80\x99d like to come with me. I know the other fellas would be really excited to see a girl there.\nPenny: How is it supposed to be a dance if I\xe2\x80\x99m the only girl?\nHoward: Well, that may be a slight exaggeration. You\xe2\x80\x99d be the only doable girl.\nPenny: You\xe2\x80\x99re a pig, Howard.\nHoward: How is doable anything but a compliment?\nLeonard: Howard, why don\xe2\x80\x99t we just work on the robot?\nHoward: Please, Leonard, not now. Once again, Penny and I have begun our little tango.\nPenny: Our tango?\nHoward: The carnal repartee, the erotic to and fro. But as delicious as the appetizer might be, at some point we will have to succumb and eat the entree while it\xe2\x80\x99s still\xe2\x80\xa6 hot.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m begging you, stop talking.\nPenny: Look, normally I can just ignore you. I mean, I get it, you\xe2\x80\x99re a little peculiar. You know, like Sheldon.\nSheldon: Yeah, excuse me, Penny, but in this room, you\xe2\x80\x99re the one who\xe2\x80\x99s peculiar.\nPenny: Yeah, you might be right. But back to you. I know you think you\xe2\x80\x99re some sort of smooth-talking ladies\xe2\x80\x99 man, but the truth is, you are just pathetic and creepy.\nHoward: Um, so what are you saying?\nPenny: I am saying it is not a compliment to call me doable. It\xe2\x80\x99s not sexy to stare at my ass and say, \xe2\x80\x9cOoh, it must be jelly \xe2\x80\x99cause jam don\xe2\x80\x99t shake like that.\xe2\x80\x9d And most important, we are not dancing a tango, we\xe2\x80\x99re not to\xe2\x80\x99ing and fro\xe2\x80\x99ing. Nothing is ever going to happen between us. Ever.\nHoward: Wait a minute. This isn\xe2\x80\x99t flirting, you\xe2\x80\x99re serious.\nPenny: Flirting? You think I\xe2\x80\x99m flirting with you? I am not flirting with you, no woman is ever gonna flirt with you, you\xe2\x80\x99re just gonna grow old and die alone.\nHoward: Thanks for the heads up.\nLeonard: Howard, where you going?\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m going home to live my creepy, pathetic life.\nLeonard: Wow.\nPenny: Well, someone had to say it. (Raj whispers in Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s ear) What?\nLeonard: He said maybe we should enter you in the killer robot competition.\nScene: Howard\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom.\nHoward\xe2\x80\x99s Mother (voice): Howard, the phone is ringing!\nHoward: Here\xe2\x80\x99s a crazy idea, Ma, answer it!\nHoward\xe2\x80\x99s Mother (voice): Hello? All right, hold on. It\xe2\x80\x99s your friend, Leonard! He wants to know why you\xe2\x80\x99re not at school today!\nHoward: I don\xe2\x80\x99t go to school, Ma. I work at a university.\nHoward\xe2\x80\x99s Mother (voice): That\xe2\x80\x99s a school! Now pick up the phone!\nHoward: I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to talk to anybody.\nHoward\xe2\x80\x99s Mother (voice): Should I ask Leonard to bring over your homework?!\nHoward: I don\xe2\x80\x99t have homework. I\xe2\x80\x99m a grown man with a master\xe2\x80\x99s degree in engineering!\nHoward\xe2\x80\x99s Mother (voice): Excuse me, Mr. Fancy-Pants. Want me to get you a Popsicle?\nHoward: Cherry, please!\nHoward\xe2\x80\x99s Mother (voice): I ate the cherry. All that\xe2\x80\x99s left is green.\nHoward: You make me want to kill myself.\nScene: The university cafeteria. Other end of the phone call.\nRaj: What\xe2\x80\x99s going on?\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, now they\xe2\x80\x99re just yelling about Popsicles. Sounds like Penny really got to him.\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99m not surprised. Despite his hard and crusty shell, Howard is a very sensitive man. Do you know he writes poetry? Mostly about men from Nantucket and hermits named Dave, but he does it with real sensitivity.\nKripke (arriving): Hey, Hofstadter. Word around the pwasma wab is you built a wobot?\nLeonard: Yes, we did, Kripke.\nSheldon: His name is Monte.\nKripke: Well, if you have any dewusions about entewing him against my wobot, the Kwipke Kwippler in the Southern California Wobot Fighting League Wound Wobin Invitational, aka the S.C.aw.F.L.aw.aw.I., his name is gonna be Swrap Metal.\nLeonard: Come on, is that really necessary?\nSheldon: Leonard, I believe it is. This is trash talk, and trash talk is a traditional component in all sporting events. Kripke, your robot is inferior and it will be defeated by ours because ours exceeds yours in both design and execution. Also, I\xe2\x80\x99m given to understand that your mother is overweight.\nRaj: Oh, snap.\nSheldon: Now, of course, if that is the result of a glandular condition and not sloth and gluttony, I withdraw that comment.\nRaj: What difference does it make? Fat is fat.\nSheldon: There are boundaries.\nKripke: Tell you what, forget the S.C.aw.F.L.aw.aw.I., let\xe2\x80\x99s settle this woboto a woboto.\nSheldon: What do you mean?\nKripke: There\xe2\x80\x99s no guawantee we\xe2\x80\x99ve gotta go against each other in the Wound Wobin, so let\xe2\x80\x99s thwow down. You know, unless you\xe2\x80\x99re afwaid.\nSheldon: We accept your challenge. Name a time and place.\nKripke: Tomowow, thwee o\xe2\x80\x99clock, the kinetics wab.\nSheldon: Make it so.\nLeonard: No, don\xe2\x80\x99t make it so. Barry, we can\xe2\x80\x99t fight you tomorrow, our engineer is incapacitated.\nKripke: What\xe2\x80\x99s wrong with him?\nRaj: He\xe2\x80\x99s depressed because he\xe2\x80\x99s pathetic and creepy and he can\xe2\x80\x99t get girls.\nKripke: We\xe2\x80\x99re all pathetic and cweepy and can\xe2\x80\x99t get girls, that\xe2\x80\x99s why we fight wobots. If you\xe2\x80\x99re not there, you\xe2\x80\x99ll be exposed to widicule.\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99m curious, what part of America is that accent from?\nScene: Outside Penny\xe2\x80\x99s door.\n  Penny: Hey.\nLeonard: Hey, you got a minute?\nPenny: Yeah, come on in. What\xe2\x80\x99s up?\nLeonard: I need you to apologize to How\xe2\x80\xa6\nPenny: Get out.\nLeonard: Come on. Wolowitz won\xe2\x80\x99t come out of his house and we need him for a robot battle.\nPenny: Well, then have the robot go and get him.\nLeonard: The robot didn\xe2\x80\x99t hurt his feelings.\nPenny: His feelings needed to be hurt.\nLeonard: He\xe2\x80\x99s been in bed for two days.\nPenny: Yeah, probably with a blow-up doll.\nLeonard: He\xe2\x80\x99s not with a\xe2\x80\xa6 does it really matter who or what he\xe2\x80\x99s with? The guy is devastated.\nPenny: Oh, please, how could I possibly devastate Howard?\nLeonard: Okay, don\xe2\x80\x99t take this as a criticism, but you kind of have that overexposed-to-gamma-rays thing going on.\nPenny: What does that mean?\nLeonard: You know, like, most of the time, you\xe2\x80\x99re the easygoing Bruce Banner, but then, when you get angry, you kind of turn into, like, you know, grrrrr!\nPenny: I turn into a bear?\nLeonard: Seriously? Gamma rays? Bruce Banner? You didn\xe2\x80\x99t get The Incredible Hulk from that? Never mind, just, please go talk to him.\nPenny: And say what? That I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean it, because I meant it.\nLeonard: Well, maybe you can go at it from a different angle, like, um, you see a glimmer of goodness in him and you only said what you said because you want to nurture it and make it shine.\nPenny: Oh, pthththth.\nLeonard: Okay, let\xe2\x80\x99s try it this way. Remember the day that we first met and you asked me to go to your boyfriend\xe2\x80\x99s apartment to get your TV back and he was nine feet tall and he took my pants off and you said\xe2\x80\xa6 what was that? What did you say? Oh, yes, you said you owed me one.\nPenny: Okay, come on, that\xe2\x80\x99s not fair.\nLeonard: I came home with no pants.\nPenny: Fine, I\xe2\x80\x99ll go over there tomorrow.\nLeonard: Thank you. I should probably give you a heads up about his mother.\nPenny: What about her?\nLeonard: She\xe2\x80\x99s a delightful woman. You\xe2\x80\x99ll love her.\nScene: Howard\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom.\nHoward\xe2\x80\x99s Mother (voice): Howard, there\xe2\x80\x99s a blonde girl, Patsy, here to see you!\nHoward: Who?\nHoward\xe2\x80\x99s Mother (voice): Okay, now she\xe2\x80\x99s saying it\xe2\x80\x99s Penny.\nHoward: I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to talk to her.\nPenny (entering): Hey.\nHoward: Ma!\nHoward\xe2\x80\x99s Mother (voice): She ran past me. Was I supposed to tackle her?\nPenny: So, I just came by to see how you were doing.\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m fine.\nPenny: Good. Your mom seems nice.\nHoward: People move away from her on the bus. What do you want?\nPenny: Okay, look. Howard, I just want to apologize for some things that I have said. About you. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been informed that you have feelings. And apparently, I have hurt them. So, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. Howard.\nHoward: Fine, you\xe2\x80\x99re sorry. Good-bye.\nPenny: So, you\xe2\x80\x99re okay?\nHoward: Hey, I\xe2\x80\x99m a big boy. I\xe2\x80\x99m not traumatized by some random comment from some random woman. I mean, get over yourself.\nPenny: Okay. Well, bye. (Penny leaves room. Sound of Howard crying through door.) So close (goes back in.)\nScene: The apartment. The guys are watching footage on a laptop screen.\n  Leonard: Oh, my God. That\xe2\x80\x99s Kripke\xe2\x80\x99s robot?\nKripke (voice): As you can see, the Kwippler is weducing the Chevy Cavawier to wubble.\nRaj: I can\xe2\x80\x99t watch anymore.\nLeonard: Sheldon, we have to call it off.\nSheldon: We don\xe2\x80\x99t have that option, we\xe2\x80\x99ve accepted the challenge. We can\xe2\x80\x99t run away from a fight.\nLeonard: Oh, please, we\xe2\x80\x99ve spent our whole lives running away from fights. Personally, I can squeeze through a hole in a fence half my size.\nSheldon: Impressive as that may be, Monte is not us. Monte has no fear.\nRaj: Sheldon, did we all not just watch the same video? Kripke\xe2\x80\x99s robot just had angry sex with a mid-sized automobile.\nSheldon: You are overlooking the fact that we now know what we\xe2\x80\x99re up against and we can modify Monte so that he\xe2\x80\x99s prepared.\nLeonard: You want to prepare him? Install a bladder and a pair of shorts so he can wet himself.\nRaj: Excuse me, but how are we going to make any modifications without Wolowitz? Have you heard from Penny yet?\nLeonard: Not yet.\nSheldon: Have faith, gentlemen. We don\xe2\x80\x99t need Wolowitz, engineering is merely the slow younger brother of physics. Watch and learn. Do either of you know how to open the toolbox?\nScene: Howard\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom.\nHoward: And then, when I was 14, I met Marcy Grossman. She was so beautiful. She just got her braces off but they left a little of the overbite. It was so hot, like a sexy little chipmunk. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t have the courage to ask her out, but I dedicated a song to her at the ninth grade talent show.\nPenny: Aw, that sounds sweet.\nHoward: Marcy Grossman is sunshine, on a cloudy day, when it\xe2\x80\x99s cold outside, Marcy Grossman is the month of May\xe2\x80\xa6\nPenny: Oh, it\xe2\x80\x99s cute.\nHoward: I guess you\xe2\x80\x99d say, what can make me feel this way, Marcy Grossman, Marcy Grossman, Marcy Grossman, Talkin\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x99bout Marcy\xe2\x80\xa6\nPenny: That\xe2\x80\x99s great.\nHoward: Grossman.\nPenny: Oh, it\xe2\x80\x99s fun.\nHoward: And then she came up with that sexy little chipmunk mouth and spit in my hair. Which brings us to tenth grade.\nPenny: Howard, do you think maybe sometimes you try too hard?\nHoward: Look at me. What chance do I have if I don\xe2\x80\x99t try too hard?\nPenny: Well, you\xe2\x80\x99d have a terrific chance. I mean, you\xe2\x80\x99re smart, you\xe2\x80\x99re funny, you have a cool job. You build stuff that goes into outer space.\nHoward: I guess.\nPenny: Look, I\xe2\x80\x99m telling you, I\xe2\x80\x99ve known you for, like, a year and a half and this is the first time I feel like I\xe2\x80\x99m talking to a real person. And you know what? I like him, he\xe2\x80\x99s a nice guy.\nHoward: You really think so?\nPenny: Yes.\nHoward: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\nPenny: I do. (Howard tries to kiss her. She punches him.)\nScene: The lab.\n  Leonard: Nice little bot you\xe2\x80\x99ve got here.\nKripke: I\xe2\x80\x99m aware.\nLeonard: What\xe2\x80\x99s this do, spin?\nKripke: Yep. At 3400 RPM. It can cut through steel like it was wubber.\nLeonard: Neat. Good work. Sheldon, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got to call this off.\nSheldon: No, Leonard. For years, merciless thugs like Kripke have made my life a series of painful noogies and humiliating wedgies and the insensitively named Indian burns. That stops now.\nRaj: But, Sheldon, we don\xe2\x80\x99t have a chance. The only improvement you were able to make on the robot was to put fresh batteries in the remote.\nSheldon: What you fail to realize is Kripke suffers from a fatal flaw, overconfidence from his robot\xe2\x80\x99s massive size and its overwhelming power.\nRaj: That\xe2\x80\x99s not overconfidence, that\xe2\x80\x99s observation.\nSheldon: Trust me, Kripke will fall easy prey to my psychological warfare. Observe. Kripke! I would ask if your robot is prepared to meet its maker, but as you are its maker, clearly the two of you have met.\nKripke: What is his pwoblem?\nRaj: Way to bust out the Jedi mind tricks, dude.\nLeonard: I just want to make sure that we\xe2\x80\x99re all clear, standard robotic fighting league rules apply.\nKripke: Are you cwazy? This is a stweet fight, the stweet has no rules.\nSheldon: He\xe2\x80\x99s right, Leonard. The paradigm is to the death.\nKripke: I will, however, give you the opportunity to concede my supewiowity now and offer me your wobot as the spoils of war.\nSheldon: Never. I\xe2\x80\x99d rather see Monte dead than in your hands.\nKripke: That could be easily awanged. Weady, set, go?\nSheldon: Do it.\nKripke: Alwight then. Weady. Set. Go.\nRaj: Come on, Sheldon, you got this.\nSheldon: Indeed. We are prepared for anything he can throw at us. (A flame begins to jet out of Kripke\xe2\x80\x99s robot.) That\xe2\x80\x99s new.\nLeonard: Run, Monte, run!\nRaj: Go, Monte! Go Monte!\nLeonard: Go, go, go, go!\nSheldon: Don\xe2\x80\x99t hurt us, don\xe2\x80\x99t hurt us,\nScene: The apartment. Monte is in pieces on the table.\nLeonard: Well, so much for making up for the emotional wounds of childhood.\nSheldon: I did this. Monte was killed by my hubris and my pride. No matter what anybody says, this is my fault.\nRaj: No one\xe2\x80\x99s arguing with you, dude.\nHoward (arriving): I got your text. How bad is\xe2\x80\xa6 Oy.\nLeonard: Forget the robot. What happened to you?\nPenny: He slipped and fell.\nHoward: Yes, I slipped and fell. In the bathroom. Bounced right off the tub.\nPenny: Yes, now he knows what bathtubs are capable of doing when you don\xe2\x80\x99t treat them with respect.\nHoward: Yeah. They sucker punch you when your eyes are closed.\nSheldon: So what do you think, Howard? It\xe2\x80\x99s not that bad, right?\nHoward: Oh, no. A little electrical tape, some solder. Are you insane? I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen space probes that crashed into the desert that were in better shape than this.\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re right. Monte\xe2\x80\x99s gone. We\xe2\x80\x99ll bury him in the morning. A simple ceremony. I\xe2\x80\x99ll speak. Leonard, you\xe2\x80\x99ll play your cello.\nPenny: Sheldon, honey, aren\xe2\x80\x99t you getting a little carried away? I mean, it\xe2\x80\x99s just a toy robot.\nSheldon: Just a toy robot?\nLeonard: Penny.\nPenny: I know, I got it. Sheldon, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.\nHoward: Well, don\xe2\x80\x99t get the wrong idea. The way I see it, I\xe2\x80\x99m halfway to pity sex.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
