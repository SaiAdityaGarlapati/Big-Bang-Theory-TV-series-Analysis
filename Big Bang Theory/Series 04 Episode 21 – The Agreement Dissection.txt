b'Scene: The bathroom\nSheldon: Leonard, are you in the shower?\nLeonard: I can\xe2\x80\x99t hear you, I\xe2\x80\x99m in the shower.\nSheldon: I asked if you were in the shower, but that\xe2\x80\x99s moot now.\nLeonard: What?\nSheldon: Moot. Rendered unimportant by recent events.\nLeonard: I can\xe2\x80\x99t hear you, I\xe2\x80\x99m in the shower.\nSheldon: I have to skip the chitchat. Emergency.\nLeonard: What kind of emergency?\nSheldon: Mathematical. 32-ounce banana smoothie, 16-ounce bladder.\nLeonard: You might not want to do that.\nSheldon: I assure you I do.\nLeonard: Sheldon, I\xe2\x80\x99m not alone in here.\nSheldon: What?\nPriya: Hello, Sheldon.\nSheldon: What are you doing in there? She can\xe2\x80\x99t be in here.\nLeonard: We were in here first, you can\xe2\x80\x99t be in here.\nSheldon: According to the roommate agreement, paragraph nine, subsection B, the right to bathroom privacy is suspended in the event of force majeure. And believe me, I am experiencing a very majeure force.\nSheldon: Come on, you can\xe2\x80\x99t wait two minutes?\nPriya: Oh, Leonard, let the man pee.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s door.\n  Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Penny? (Knock, knock, knock) Penny? (Knock, knock, knock) Penny?\nPenny: What?\nSheldon: Move. Move. Move!\nCredits sequence.\n  Scene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Dr. Leonard Hofstadter, you are officially charged with two violations of the roommate agreement. Do you waive reading of the charges?\nLeonard: Yeah, fine.\nPriya: Hang on. No, my client does not waive reading of the charges.\nLeonard: Oh. Cool. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a lawyer. And I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen her naked.\nPriya: Proceed.\nSheldon: Very well. Count the first, on or about the 28th day of April, the accused did knowingly and with malice aforethought deny access to the shared bathroom in a time of emergency, to wit, my back teeth were floating. Count the second, the accused exceeded the agreed upon occupancy of the shower, to wit, one, unless we are under attack by water-soluble aliens.\nPriya: Can I see the roommate agreement?\nSheldon: Um, it\xe2\x80\x99s fairly technical.\nPriya: I think I can handle it.\nLeonard: Top of her class, Cambridge University. Licensed to practice law in three countries. And your face.\nPriya: All right, based on a cursory reading, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t look like you have much of a case, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Do so, do so.\nPriya: Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid not. Section seven here, on the right to enter the bathroom in emergency situations, is not specific as to what constitutes an emergency.\nSheldon: Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s ridiculous. A bathroom emergency is self-explanatory.\nPriya: Is it? If Leonard forgot to trim his nose hair, could he barge in while you were showering?\nSheldon: Irrelevant. Leonard doesn\xe2\x80\x99t trim his nose hair. He thinks because he\xe2\x80\x99s short nobody can see up there.\nPriya: My point is, Sheldon, the legal principle is ambiguity in a contract benefits the party that did not draft it, in this case, Leonard. So much for count one.\nSheldon: But\xe2\x80\xa6\nPriya: There\xe2\x80\x99s no buts, Sheldon, that\xe2\x80\x99s how the law works.\nLeonard: Schooled!\nPriya: As for the shower capacity issue, I cite addendum J. When Sheldon showers second, any and all measures shall be taken to ensure an adequate supply of hot water. I believe this supercedes the occupancy issue.\nLeonard: Superceded!\nSheldon: This isn\xe2\x80\x99t over.\nLeonard: No offence, but shower sex with you is now the second best thing that\xe2\x80\x99s happened today.\nScene: The apartment.\nRaj: Mmm, Greek food on pizza night? This is the most delightfully cruel thing we\xe2\x80\x99ve done to Sheldon since we left that fake message from Stephen Hawking on his voice mail.\nPriya: Seriously?\nHoward (in Stephen Hawking voice): I wish to discuss your theories of black holes. Meet me at the Randy\xe2\x80\x99s Donut by the airport at 2:00 a.m.\nSheldon: What is that you\xe2\x80\x99re eating? Tonight is pizza night.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99d like to refer that to my attorney.\nPriya: According to what I see here, Thursday nights are Franconi\xe2\x80\x99s pizza night.\nSheldon: Yes, and when Franconi\xe2\x80\x99s went out of business, we switched to Graziano\xe2\x80\x99s.\nHoward: That\xe2\x80\x99s interesting. Can you just switch restaurants like that, Priya?\nPriya: A good question, Howard. Turns out you can\xe2\x80\x99t. According to the document you drew up, Sheldon, the selection of a new takeout restaurant requires public hearings and a 60-day comment period. Were those criteria met?\nSheldon: No.\nAll: Opa!\nSheldon: This is Greek food? Leonard, you hate Greek food.\nLeonard: Not as much as you.\nSheldon: Fine. I\xe2\x80\x99m nothing if not adaptable.\nLeonard: I got you the lamb kabob.\nSheldon: Thank you. If you think about it, Greek food isn\xe2\x80\x99t that far from italian food. They share a spice palette. And what a civilization is the Greeks. They gave us science, democracy, and little cubes of charred meat that taste like sweat.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s door.\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Penny? (Knock, knock, knock) Penny? (Knock, knock, knock) Penny?\nPenny: Hey. What\xe2\x80\x99s up?\nSheldon: The mean Indian lady tried to make me eat lamb. Congratulations. Pizza night will now be at your apartment. Order one.\nPenny: Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, honey, I\xe2\x80\x99m meeting Amy and Bernadette for dinner. But you\xe2\x80\x99re welcome to tag along.\nSheldon: A girls night? Oh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if I\xe2\x80\x99m up for an evening talking about rainbows, unicorns and menstrual cramps.\nPenny: Okay, suit yourself. We\xe2\x80\x99ll probably be trashing Priya a little.\nSheldon: Shotgun.\nScene: A bar.\nPenny: Okay, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to propose a toast to a wonderful girls night out.\nAmy: Fair warning, we can get ker-razy.\nBernadette: Yeah. Last week we smoked cigars and pretended to be dragons.\nSheldon: Really, Amy? Tobacco and alcohol? Need I remind you not a lot of scientific discoveries were made by people having a good time?\nAmy: Why did you bring him? He\xe2\x80\x99s harshing my buzz.\nPenny: I felt sorry for him. Priya\xe2\x80\x99s giving him a hard time.\nBernadette: Ooh, the Priya bashing\xe2\x80\x99s starting early. Yay! Okay, what\xe2\x80\x99s up with those pantsuits?\nAmy: I need some context.\nPenny: Pantsuits suck.\nAmy: And that opens her up To justifiable ridicule for wearing them. Good one, Bernadette. See? Ker-razy.\nScene: The same, later.\nBernadette: Whee-ee-ee!\nAmy: You smell like baby powder.\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s talc. But as that\xe2\x80\x99s a primary ingredient of baby powder, I understand your confusion.\nAmy: Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m not confused at all. You\xe2\x80\x99re like a sexy toddler.\nSheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how to process that.\nBernadette: I do. Amy and Sheldon sitting in a tree. K-I-S-S-S-S-I-N-G.\nPenny: That\xe2\x80\x99s too many S\xe2\x80\x99s for kissing.\nBernadette: Not if they\xe2\x80\x99re doing it for a long time.\nPenny: Sheldon, have you ever kissed a girl?\nSheldon: Other than my mother, my sister and my mee-maw, no. But in the interest of full disclosure, I was once on a bus and had to give mouth-to-mouth resuscitation to an elderly nun who passed out from heat exhaustion. Every year I get a Christmas card from her, signed with far too many X\xe2\x80\x99s and O\xe2\x80\x99s.\nBernadette: That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t count. Aren\xe2\x80\x99t you even a little curious?\nPenny: Yeah, you\xe2\x80\x99re a scientist, where is the curiosity?\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99m available for experimentation.\nSheldon: Thank you. Not necessary. We know everything there is to know about kissing. It requires 34 facial muscles and 112 postural muscles.\nAmy: Oh, blah, blah, blah. Give me some sugar, bestie (kisses Penny).\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m certainly glad no one said they were curious about Aztec human sacrifice.\nPenny: Hey, I know, let\xe2\x80\x99s take Sheldon dancing.\nBernadette: Oh, I totally want to see Sheldon dance. I bet he looks like a spider on a hot plate.\nSheldon: No, thank you, but for the record, I\xe2\x80\x99m an excellent dancer. Proficient in the rumba, waltz and cha-cha.\nAmy: Really?\nSheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t see why that\xe2\x80\x99s surprising. I excel at so many things. You\xe2\x80\x99ve had my sourdough bread.\nPenny: Did you take dance lessons?\nSheldon: Against my will. In the South, pre-adolescent children are forced through a process called cotillion, which indoctrinates them with all the social graces and dance skills needed to function in 18th century Vienna.\nPenny: Oh, we are so taking you dancing.\nSheldon: No, you most certainly are not.\nBernadette: Well, what does your cotillion training say is expected of a gentleman when three ladies ask him to escort them to a dance soiree?\nSheldon: I saved a nun\xe2\x80\x99s life. Why am I being punished?\nScene: A taxi.\n  Penny: Take us to a place we can waltz.\nTaxi driver: Where you can what?\nSheldon: Waltz. It\xe2\x80\x99s a social dance from Austria, choreographed to a three-four time signature. (Sings Blue Danube. The taxi driver says something into radio in Korean. The word \xe2\x80\x9cwaltz\xe2\x80\x9d is included. Dispatcher replies also in Korean. Taxi driver sings Blue Danube. Dispatcher says \xe2\x80\x9coh, waltz!\xe2\x80\x9d They speak Korean some more. )\nTaxi Driver: Here we go.\nAmy (singing): I kissed a girl and I liked it, I hope my boyfriend don\xe2\x80\x99t mind it.\nSheldon: What happened to you?\nScene: A Korean ballroom dancing club. Sheldon and Amy are dancing.\nPenny: Shake it baby, shake it!\nBernadette: Muy caliente, Sheldon!\nElderly Korean Gentleman: Care to dance?\nBernadette: Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, I\xe2\x80\x99m engaged.\nKorean: How about you?\nPenny: Oh, what the hell. Ooh!\nScene: Outside Amy\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nAmy: How come if we\xe2\x80\x99re the smart people, we don\xe2\x80\x99t do this every night?\nSheldon: What\xe2\x80\x99s 16 times 14?\nAmy: My burps taste like cranberry juice.\nSheldon: And there\xe2\x80\x99s your answer.\nAmy: Would you like to come in for a nightcap?\nSheldon: If you\xe2\x80\x99re referring to the beverage, you know I don\xe2\x80\x99t drink. If you\xe2\x80\x99re referring to the hat you don while wearing a nightshirt and holding a candle, I have one.\nAmy: I have yoo-hoo.\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to say no to yoo-hoo. The name literally beckons.\nAmy: Make yourself comfortable.\nSheldon: Thank you. Is someone smoking?\nAmy: Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s just Ricky.\nSheldon: You own a smoking monkey?\nAmy: Don\xe2\x80\x99t be silly. He\xe2\x80\x99s one of the animals in my department\xe2\x80\x99s nicotine addiction study.\nSheldon: What\xe2\x80\x99s he doing here?\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99m giving him emphysema. The least I can do is let him hang out and watch cable.\nSheldon: Remarkable. Aren\xe2\x80\x99t you worried about secondhand smoke?\nAmy: A little. The real danger is him biting my face off while I\xe2\x80\x99m sleeping.\nSheldon: is he deliberately blowing smoke at me?\nAmy: Yeah. He\xe2\x80\x99s kind of an ass.\nSheldon: Thank you. May I share something with you that\xe2\x80\x99s troubling me?\nAmy: Of course. What\xe2\x80\x99s rattling around that big bulbous brain of yours?\nSheldon: Priya has essentially nullified my roommate agreement with Leonard, making life in the apartment very uncomfortable for me.\nAmy: And you want me to kill her? Done.\nSheldon: No, of course not.\nAmy: I trained Ricky how to smoke. I can train him to shoot a poison dart. No jury would convict us \xe2\x80\x99cause people love monkeys.\nSheldon: I understand the alcohol has stirred up whatever it is that makes girls go wild, but I really need to talk to smart Amy now.\nAmy: Excuse me. Have you considered that your intelligence might be the very thing causing your dilemma?\nSheldon: No.\nAmy: What do you think Ricky over here would do if an interloper encroached on his territory?\nSheldon: Well, when challenged, monkeys generally assert their dominance through chasing, assault and a stylized penile display. That\xe2\x80\x99s a little outside my comfort zone.\nAmy: You\xe2\x80\x99re being too literal. My point is, he would not meekly surrender to the rules, and neither should you.\nSheldon: Are you suggesting I play dirty?\nAmy: Yes, dirty. Dirty, dirty, dirty. Which brings me to our next order of business. (Kisses him)\nSheldon: Fascinating.\nAmy: I hope you don\xe2\x80\x99t take what I\xe2\x80\x99m about to do as a comment on what we just did. (Runs to bathroom and vomits)\nSheldon (to Ricky): Who\xe2\x80\x99s to say you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be dissecting our brains? You really are an ass.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: Morning, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Oh, good, you\xe2\x80\x99re up. I\xe2\x80\x99ve written a new and improved roommate agreement that benefits me greatly. I\xe2\x80\x99d like you to sign it.\nLeonard: Why would I want to do that?\nSheldon: Excellent question. Do you remember what happened to the alien, played by talented character actor Frank Gorshin, in the Star Trek episode Let That Be Your Last Battlefield?\nLeonard: Uh, Captain Kirk activated the self-destruct sequence and threatened to blow up the Enterpriseand kill them both unless he gave in?\nSheldon: Affirmative. Computer, this is Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Activate self-destruct sequence. Code 1-1-A-2-B.\nFemale Voice: Self-destruct sequence activated.\nLeonard: What are you gonna do, Sheldon, blow up the apartment?\nSheldon: That was my first thought, but all my cool stuff is here.\nPriya: So what happens when it counts down?\nSheldon: Unless Leonard signs the new agreement in the next 41 seconds, this computer will send an e-mail to your parents in India saying that you\xe2\x80\x99re in a secret relationship with the whiter-than-marshmallow-fluff Leonard Hofstadter.\nPriya: Oh, my God.\nLeonard: What\xe2\x80\x99s the big deal?\nPriya: Trust me, it\xe2\x80\x99s a big deal.\nLeonard: They\xe2\x80\x99re gonna find out about me eventually, right?\nPriya: Yeah, of course, just not today.\nSheldon: 20 seconds.\nLeonard: Are you ashamed of me?\nPriya: Of course not.\nLeonard: Then why can\xe2\x80\x99t we tell your parents?\nPriya: Please, don\xe2\x80\x99t push this.\nSheldon: He does that all the time, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t he? 15.\nPriya: Okay, fine, Sheldon, you win. Turn it off.\nLeonard: No, he\xe2\x80\x99s bluffing.\nSheldon: I never bluff. Ten.\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s blackmail!\nSheldon: Nine.\nPriya: We give up.\nSheldon: Eight.\nLeonard: This is ridiculous. (Pulls out plug)\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s a laptop with a full charge. Honestly, what do you see in him?\nPriya: Give him what he wants or we\xe2\x80\x99re done.\nSheldon: Three.\nLeonard: Really?\nSheldon: Two.\nLeonard: Okay, I\xe2\x80\x99ll sign it!\nFemale Voice: Self-destruct sequence aborted.\nSheldon: You may have gone to Cambridge, but I\xe2\x80\x99m an honorary graduate of Starfleet academy.\nScene: The apartment. Sheldon is at his laptop.\nSheldon: Good morning, Amy.\nAmy: It most assuredly is not.\nSheldon: Are you experiencing dehydration, headache, nausea and shame?\nAmy: Yes. I also found a Korean man\xe2\x80\x99s business card tucked into my cleavage. What happened last night?\nSheldon: Ah, memory impairment, the free prize at the bottom of every vodka bottle.\nAmy: Sheldon?\nSheldon: All right. Last night you gave me some excellent advice regarding my problem here at home, you kissed me and then vomited on and off for 40 minutes, following which you passed out on your bathroom floor. I then folded a towel under your head as a pillow, set your oven clock to the correct time because it was driving me crazy, and I left.\nAmy: Okay. Don\xe2\x80\x99t really know where we go from here.\nSheldon: I suggest we treat our relationship as if it were a crashed computer and restore it to the last point we both agree it worked.\nAmy: Terrific. Thank you. (Noise of Ricky in background) They were out of menthols! Get off my back! Not easy living with a temperamental little primate.\nLeonard (off): Come on, Priya, just admit I embarrass you!\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re preaching to the choir, sister.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
