b'Scene: The University cafeteria.\nSheldon: Here\xe2\x80\x99s the problem with teleportation.\nLeonard: Lay it on me.\nSheldon: Assuming the device could be invented which would identify the quantum state of matter of an individual in one location, and transmit that pattern to a distant location for reassembly, you would not have actually transported the individual. You would have destroyed him in one location, and recreated him in another.\nLeonard: How about that.\nSheldon: Personally, I would never use a transporter. Because the original Sheldon would have to be disintegrated in order to create a new Sheldon.\nLeonard: Would the new Sheldon be in any way an improvement on the old Sheldon?\nSheldon: No, he would be exactly the same.\nLeonard: That is a problem.\nSheldon: So, you see it too.\nDr Gablehouser (arriving): Dr Hofstadter, Dr Cooper.\nTogether: Dr Gablehouser.\nGablehouser: Gentlemen, I\xe2\x80\x99d like you to meet Dennis Kim. Dennis is a highly sought after Doctorial candidate and we\xe2\x80\x99re hoping to have him do his graduate work here.\nLeonard: Graduate work, very impressive.\nGablehouser: And he\xe2\x80\x99s only fifteen years old.\nSheldon: Not bad, I myself started graduate school at fourteen.\nDennis: Well, I lost a year while my family was tunnelling out of North Korea.\nLeonard: Advantage Kim.\nGablehouser: I thought maybe you boys could show Dennis around, let him see why we\xe2\x80\x99re the best physics research facility in the country.\nDennis: I already know you\xe2\x80\x99re not. You don\xe2\x80\x99t have an open science grid computer, or a free electron laser, and the string theory research being done here is nothing but a dead end.\nSheldon: Excuse me, that is my research, and it is by no means a dead end.\nDennis: Well, obviously you don\xe2\x80\x99t see it yet, but trust me, you will.\nGablehouser: Dennis, we discussed this, we\xe2\x80\x99re in the process of updating our equipment, and we welcome your input on our research goals, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve agreed to look the other way if you want to use up to 20% of the grant money you attract to smuggle your grandfather out of Pyongyang. We want him here boys, make it happen.\nLeonard: Yes sir.\nSheldon: You can count on us, we\xe2\x80\x99re on it. What the hell do you mean, dead end.\nDennis: I mean, the whole landscape of false vacuums in string theory could be as large as ten to the five-hundredth power. In addition\xe2\x80\xa6 ooh, look, chocolate milk.\nSheldon: I sense a disturbance in the force.\nLeonard (in a Yoda voice): A bad feeling I have about this, mmm-hmmm.\nCredits sequence\nScene: A corridor.\nLeonard: So, Dennis, how long have you been in America.\nDennis: A year and a half.\nLeonard: No kidding, you speak English really well.\nDennis: So do you. Except for your tendency to end sentences with prepositions.\nLeonard: What are you talking about?\nDennis: That.\nSheldon: He\xe2\x80\x99s not wrong. Alright, and this is my office.\nDennis: Is this part of the tour?\nSheldon: Nope. Goodbye.\nLeonard: Come on, Sheldon, we\xe2\x80\x99ve hardly shown him anything.\nSheldon: Oh, alright, this is my desk, these are my books, this is my door, please close it behind you. Goodbye.\nDennis: Looks like you\xe2\x80\x99re doing work in quantum loop corrections.\nSheldon: Keen observation, goodbye.\nDennis: You see where you went wrong, don\xe2\x80\x99t you?\nSheldon: Leonard.\nLeonard: Huh, yeah?\nSheldon: Get him out.\nLeonard: Come on, Dennis, I\xe2\x80\x99ll show you the rec centre, they\xe2\x80\x99ve got nautilus equipment.\nDennis: Do I look like I lift weights.\nLeonard: Not heavy ones.\nDennis: It\xe2\x80\x99s startling to me you haven\xe2\x80\x99t considered a Lorentz invariant field theory approach.\nSheldon: You think I haven\xe2\x80\x99t considered it? You really think I haven\xe2\x80\x99t considered it?\nDennis: Have you considered it?\nSheldon: Get him out Leonard.\nLeonard: Come on, Dennis, I\xe2\x80\x99ll show you the radiation lab.\nDennis: Wow, you won the Stephenson award.\nSheldon: Yes, in fact I am the youngest person ever to win it.\nDennis: Really, how old?\nSheldon: Fourteen and a half.\nDennis: You were the youngest person ever to win it.\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s like looking into an obnoxious little mirror, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\nScene: The living room of the apartment.\nPenny (to Raj): Mmm, this is really delicious, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? (Raj looks uncomfortable, then nods.) Still can\xe2\x80\x99t talk to me unless you\xe2\x80\x99re drunk, huh? (Shakes head) Oh, sweetie, you are so damaged.\nHoward: Hey, I\xe2\x80\x99m damaged too. How about a hug for Howie?\nPenny: Sure. Raj, hug Howard.\nSheldon (dramatically): Uh-uh-uh.\nLeonard: Something you\xe2\x80\x99d like to share? A tale of woe perhaps.\nSheldon: Fifteen years old. Dennis Kim is fifteen years old, and he\xe2\x80\x99s already correcting my work. Today I went from being Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart to\xe2\x80\xa6 you know, that other guy.\nHoward: Antonio Salieri?\nSheldon: Oh, God, now even you\xe2\x80\x99re smarter than me.\nHoward: You know, Sheldon, you don\xe2\x80\x99t have so many friends that you can afford to start insulting them.\nLeonard: Just eat, Sheldon, you\xe2\x80\x99ll feel better.\nSheldon: Why waste food. In Texas when a cow goes dry they don\xe2\x80\x99t keep feeding it, they just take her out and shoot her between the eyes.\nPenny: I\xe2\x80\x99m confused, did Sheldon stop giving milk?\nLeonard: You can\xe2\x80\x99t let this kid get to you. You always knew that someday someone would come along who was younger and smarter.\nSheldon: Yes, but I assumed I would have been dead hundreds of years, and that there would be an asterisk by his name because he would be a cyborg.\nPenny: So, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got a bit of competition, I really don\xe2\x80\x99t see what the big deal is.\nSheldon: Well of course you don\xe2\x80\x99t, you\xe2\x80\x99ve never excelled at anything.\nPenny: I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand, exactly how did he get any friends in the first place?\nHoward: We liked Leonard.\nLeonard: Well, what are you going to do, Sheldon, give up?\nSheldon: Yes. That\xe2\x80\x99s what a rational person does when his entire life\xe2\x80\x99s work is invalidated by a post-pubescent Asian wunderkind. He ceases his fruitless efforts, he donates his body to scientific research, and he waits to die.\nPenny: You know, I\xe2\x80\x99m confused again, is he waiting, or do we get to shoot him between the eyes?\nScene: The same, later that night\nSheldon: Hey.\nLeonard: Hey.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99ve decided you\xe2\x80\x99re right. My career is not over.\nLeonard: Great.\nSheldon: But, since the arrival of Dennis Kim has rendered my research pointless, I just have to find something else to focus on.\nLeonard: Great.\nSheldon: So I\xe2\x80\x99ve decided, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to collaborate with you.\nLeonard: Great.\nSheldon: What exactly is it you do? I know you chatter on about it all the time, but I\xe2\x80\x99ve never really paid attention.\nLeonard: Okay, well, right now I\xe2\x80\x99m designing an experiment to study the soft component of cosmic radiation at sea-level, but I really don\xe2\x80\x99t need any help.\nSheldon: Oh, sure you do. Now, see, what\xe2\x80\x99s this here in the schematic, is that a laser array?\nLeonard: Yes.\nSheldon: No. Hmmm. What happens if you use argon lasers instead of helium neon?\nLeonard: It would blow up.\nSheldon: Are you sure?\nLeonard: Pretty sure.\nSheldon: Pretty sure\xe2\x80\x99s not very scientific, is this how you normally work, just hunches and guesses and stuff?\nLeonard: Okay, Sheldon, I understand that you\xe2\x80\x99re going through a bit of a career crisis, you\xe2\x80\x99re searching for some other area where you can feel valuable and productive but I need to tell you something and I want you to listen carefully.\nSheldon: Alright.\nLeonard: Go away.\nSheldon: If you\xe2\x80\x99re concerned about sharing credit with me, you\xe2\x80\x99re name can go first\xe2\x80\xa6 I\xe2\x80\x99m going.\nScene: Howard\xe2\x80\x99s lab.\nHoward (into phone): It\xe2\x80\x99s a small brown paper bag, Ma, I\xe2\x80\x99m looking at it right now. (Pause.) Why would I make that up, there\xe2\x80\x99s no ding-dong in it. (Pause.) How are two ding-dongs tomorrow going to help me today?\nSheldon (entering): So, this is engineering, huh?\nHoward (into phone): I\xe2\x80\x99ll talk to you later.\nSheldon: Engineering. Where the noble semi-skilled labourers execute the vision of those who think and dream. Hello, oompah-loompahs of science.\nHoward: Sheldon, what are you doing here?\nSheldon: I just came by to say hello.\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99ve been at this lab for three years, you\xe2\x80\x99ve never came by to say hello.\nSheldon: Well, up until now I\xe2\x80\x99ve had better things to do. So, what are we making today?\nHoward: A small payload support structure for a European science experimental package that\xe2\x80\x99s going up on the next space shuttle.\nSheldon: Really, how does it work?\nHoward: When this is done, it will be attached to the payload bay, and the sensor apparatus will rest on it.\nSheldon: Uh, huh. So it\xe2\x80\x99s a shelf?\nHoward: No, you don\xe2\x80\x99t understand, during acceleration it needs to stay perfectly level and provide\xe2\x80\xa6 yeah, okay, it\xe2\x80\x99s a shelf.\nSheldon: Now, I notice you\xe2\x80\x99re using titanium, did you give any consideration to carbon nanotubes, they\xe2\x80\x99re lighter, cheaper and half twice the tensile strength.\nHoward: Sheldon, there\xe2\x80\x99s a diploma in my office that says I have a masters in engineering.\nSheldon: And you also have a note from your mother that says I love you, bubbula. But neither of those is a cogent argument for titanium over nanotubes.\nHoward: Sheldon.\nSheldon: Yes.\nHoward: Go away.\nSheldon: Did Leonard tell you to say that?\nHoward: No, I thought of it all by myself.\nSheldon: Huh. It can\xe2\x80\x99t be a coincidence. There must be some causal link I\xe2\x80\x99m missing.\nScene: Raj is exiting his office.\nRaj: Go away. (Sheldon exits)\nSheldon: Curiouser and curiouser.\nScene: The apartment.\nHoward (entering): Is he here?\nLeonard: If he were, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be.\nRaj: Do you know what he did. He watched me work for ten minutes, and then started to design a simple piece of software that could replace me.\nLeonard: Is that even possible?\nRaj: As it turns out, yes.\nHoward: Something\xe2\x80\x99s got to be done about him, Leonard.\nLeonard: Like what? He\xe2\x80\x99ll never be able to cope with the fact that some fifteen year-old kid is smarter and more accomplished than he is.\nRaj: Well, what if something were to happen to this boy so he was no longer a threat to Sheldon?\nHoward: Then our problem would be solved.\nLeonard: Hang on, are we talking about murdering Dennis Kim? I\xe2\x80\x99m not saying no.\nHoward: We don\xe2\x80\x99t have to go that far, there are other means available.\nRaj: We can\xe2\x80\x99t send him back to North Korea. He knows how to get out.\nHoward: The only thing we need to do is make this Kim kid lose his focus.\nLeonard: That won\xe2\x80\x99t happen, he\xe2\x80\x99s not interested in anything but physics.\nHoward: What about biology?\nLeonard: What?\nHoward: You know, biology? The one thing that can completely derail a world class mind.\nLeonard: Howard, he\xe2\x80\x99s fifteen.\nHoward: Yeah, so, when I was fifteen I met Denise Polmerry and my grade point average fell from a 5.0 to a 1.8.\nRaj: She was sleeping with you?\nHoward: No, I just wasted a lot of time thinking about what it would be like if she did.\nSheldon (entering): Oh, good, you\xe2\x80\x99re all here. Look, I\xe2\x80\x99ve decided that if the three of you drop whatever it is you\xe2\x80\x99re working on and join me, we could lick cold fusion in less than a decade, twelve years tops. (They stare at him.) Go away? (They nod) Hmm. Could it be me?\nScene: Outside Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nPenny (opening door): Oh, hey guys, what\xe2\x80\x99s up?\nHoward: We need a hot fifteen year-old Asian girl with a thing for smart guys.\nPenny: What?\nLeonard: Howard, that\xe2\x80\x99s racist, any fifteen year-old girl will do the trick. (Penny slams door.)\nRaj: It\xe2\x80\x99s possible she may have misunderstood us.\nScene: Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s office. He is making measurements on maps. There is a knock on the door.\nGablehouser (entering): Dr Cooper? Oh, are we interrupting?\nSheldon: No, no, please, come in. Yeah, I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll appreciate this, very exciting.\nGablehouser: Oh, what are you working on?\nSheldon: Something remarkable. Since my prospects for the Nobel Prize in physics have disappeared, thank you very much, I\xe2\x80\x99ve decided to refocus my efforts and use my people skills to win the Nobel Peace Prize. Look, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to solve the Middle-East Crisis by building an exact replica of Jerusalem in the middle of the Mexican desert.\nGablehouser: To what end?\nSheldon: You know, it\xe2\x80\x99s like the baseball movie, build it and they will come.\nGablehouser: Who will come?\nSheldon: The Jewish people.\nGablehouser: What if they don\xe2\x80\x99t come.\nSheldon: We\xe2\x80\x99ll make it nice, put out a spread.\nGablehouser: Okay, well, um, speaking of spreads, we\xe2\x80\x99re having a small welcoming party this afternoon for Mr Kim, who\xe2\x80\x99s agreed to join us here at the University.\nSheldon: Of course he has, the oracle told us little Neo was the one. You can see the Matrix, can\xe2\x80\x99t you.\nGablehouser: Okay, well, uh, obviously you\xe2\x80\x99re very busy with your\xe2\x80\xa6 uh, um, come Dennis. You\xe2\x80\x99ll have to excuse Dr Cooper, he\xe2\x80\x99s been under a lot of\xe2\x80\xa6 um\xe2\x80\xa6 he\xe2\x80\x99s nuts.\nSheldon (voice off, sings to a Mexican tune): Ah, la-la-la, Hava Nagila. They\xe2\x80\x99ll come, they\xe2\x80\x99ll settle and I\xe2\x80\x99ll win the prize\xe2\x80\xa6\nScene: The welcoming party\nSheldon: I really don\xe2\x80\x99t understand your objections, Professor Goldfarb, why wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t the Senoran Desert make a perfectly good promised land?\nGoldfarb: Go away.\nSheldon: We could call it Nuevo Cherusalem.\nGoldfarb: Please go away.\nSheldon: Said Pharoah to Moses.\nGablehouser: Why are all these young women here?\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s take your daughter to work day.\nGablehouser: Really, I was not aware of that.\nRaj: Oh, yes. There was a very official email that was sent to everyone whose insurance files indicated they had daughters between the ages of 14 and 16.\nGablehouser: Hm?\nHoward: Smooth.\nRaj: Thank you.\nGablehouser: There\xe2\x80\x99s the man of the hour.\nLeonard: Okay, so we now have a socially awkward genius in a room full of attractive age-appropriate women.\nHoward: All he has to do now is hook up with one of them. (The look at Dennis, who is picking his ear.)\nLeonard: Does anyone else see the flaw in this plan?\nRaj: We need a social catalyst.\nLeonard: Like what? We can\xe2\x80\x99t get fifteen year-old girls drunk.  \nHoward: Or can we?\nLeonard: No, we can\xe2\x80\x99t.\nHoward: I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you mean we can\xe2\x80\x99t. I think you mean we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t.\nSheldon: Hey, Howard. You\xe2\x80\x99re a Jew. If there was another wailing wall, exactly like the one in Jerusalem, but close to taco stands and cheap prescription drugs, would you still be able to wail at it? Okay, it\xe2\x80\x99s definitely me.\nLeonard: Okay, we cannot leave this to chance, lets pick a girl, and figure out how to get her together with Dennis.\nRaj: Okay. How about that one.\nHoward: Uh-uh. I know the type, cheerleader, student council, goes out with jocks, won\xe2\x80\x99t even look at anybody in the gifted programme. And if, after two years of begging, she does agree to go out with you, it turns out to be a set-up and you\xe2\x80\x99re in the back seat of your mom\xe2\x80\x99s car with your pants off while the whole football team laughs at you.\nRaj: Are you crying?\nHoward: No, I have allergies.\nRaj: Okay, uh, how about her?\nLeonard: Sure. If he wants to spend a couple of years doing her homework while she drinks herself into a stupor with non-fat White Russians, while you\xe2\x80\x99re the one holding her head out of the toilet while she\xe2\x80\x99s puking and telling you she wishes more guys were like you, and they she gets into Cornell because you wrote her essay for her, and you drive up to visit her one weekend and she acts like she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t even know you.\nRaj: Okay, so not her either. How about her?\nHoward: Interesting, kind of pretty, a little chubby so probably low self-esteem.\nLeonard: I think that\xe2\x80\x99s our girl. One of us should go talk to her.\nRaj: I can\xe2\x80\x99t talk to her, you do it.\nLeonard: I can\xe2\x80\x99t just go up and talk to her. Howard, you talk to her.\nHoward: Oh no, she\xe2\x80\x99ll never go for the kid once she gets a peek at this.\nRaj: You know, if we were in India this would be simpler. Five minutes with her dad, twenty goats and a laptop and we\xe2\x80\x99d be done.\nLeonard: Well, we\xe2\x80\x99re not in India.\nRaj: Alright, why don\xe2\x80\x99t we do it your way then? We\xe2\x80\x99ll arrange for this girl to move in across the hall from Dennis so he can pathetically moon over her for months on end.\nLeonard: Okay, that was uncalled for.\nRaj: You started it, dude.\nGablehouser: Could I have everyone\xe2\x80\x99s attention please. What a wonderful occasion this is. And how fortunate that it should happen to fall on take your daughter to work day. We\xe2\x80\x99re here to welcome Mr Dennis Kim to our little family.\nSheldon (sarcastically): Welcome Dennis Kim.\nGablehouser: Mr Kim was not only the valedictorian at Stamford University, he is also the youngest recipient of the prestigious Stephenson Award.\nSheldon: Youngest till the cyborgs rise up!\nGablehouser: And now, without any further ado, let me introduce the man of the hour, Mr Dennis Kim. Dennis! Dennis!\nDennis: What?\nGablehouser: Would you like to tell us a little bit about your upcoming research.\nDennis: Um, no thanks. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to the mall with Emma.\nGablehouser: Well, uh, well, uh\xe2\x80\xa6.\nLeonard: The kid got a girl.\nRaj: Unbelievable.\nHoward: Did anyone see how he did it?\nSheldon (to Gablehouser): Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got this. Ladies and Gentlemen, honoured daughters. While Mr Kim, by virtue of his youth and naivety, has fallen prey to the inexplicable need for human contact, let me step in and assure you that my research will go on uninterrupted, and that social relationships will continue to baffle and repulse me. Thank you.\nHoward: He\xe2\x80\x99s back.\nLeonard: Yeah, mission accomplished.\nRaj: Forget the mission, how did that little yutz get a girl on his own?\nHoward: I guess times have changed since we were young. Smart is the new sexy.\nLeonard: Well, why do we go home alone every night, we\xe2\x80\x99re still smart.\nRaj: Maybe we\xe2\x80\x99re too smart. So smart it\xe2\x80\x99s offputting.\nHoward: Yeah, let\xe2\x80\x99s go with that.\nScene: The park. The four guys are carrying remote control rockets.\nHoward: Unbelievable. Components I built are on the International Space Station, and I get a ticket for launching a model rocket in the park.\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if the ticket was so much for the launch as it was for you telling the policewoman \xe2\x80\x9cyou have to frisk me, I have a rocket in my pants.\xe2\x80\x9d\nRaj: Hey, look at that. (There is a group of youngsters on the grass, laying about. One is playing a guitar. Dennis Kim is among them. He is drinking something from a bottle in a brown paper bag.) It\xe2\x80\x99s Dennis Kim.\nHoward: Wow, I almost didn\xe2\x80\x99t recognise him.\nRaj: You know, I kind of feel bad about what we did to him. (Dennis is now snogging the face off Emma)\nLeonard: Yeah, we really ruined his life.\nSheldon: Screw him, he was weak.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
