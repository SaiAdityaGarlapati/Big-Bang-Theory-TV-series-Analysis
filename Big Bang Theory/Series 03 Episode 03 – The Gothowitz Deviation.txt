b'Scene: The apartment kitchen. Penny is cooking breakfast while singing and dancing along to \xe2\x80\x9cMan I Feel Like A Woman\xe2\x80\x9d by Shenia Twain. Sheldon enters.\nPenny: Morning, Sheldon. Come dance with me.\nSheldon: No.\nPenny: Why not?\nSheldon: Penny, while I subscribe to the many worlds theory which posits the existence of an infinite number of Sheldons in an infinite number of universes, I assure you that in none of them am I dancing.\nPenny: Are you fun in any of them?\nSheldon: The math would suggest that in a few I\xe2\x80\x99m a clown made of candy. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t dance.\nPenny: All right, want some French toast?\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s Oatmeal Day.\nPenny: Tell you what, next French Toast Day, I will make you oatmeal.\nSheldon: Dear Lord, are you still going to be here on French Toast Day?\nLeonard: Morning.\nSheldon: Look, Leonard, Penny made French toast.\nLeonard: Sorry. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t given her your schedule yet.\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s an iCal download, she can put it right in her phone. And I thought we agreed that you\xe2\x80\x99d have your conjugal visits in her apartment.\nLeonard: We did, but there were extenuating circumstances.\nSheldon: I see. Did her abysmal housekeeping skills finally trump her perkiness?\nLeonard: No, her bed kind of\xe2\x80\xa6 broke.\nSheldon: That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem likely. Her bed\xe2\x80\x99s of sturdy construction. Even the addition\nof a second normal size human being wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t cause a structural failure, much less a homunculus such as yourself.\nPenny: A homunculus?\nLeonard: Perfectly formed miniature human being.\nPenny: Oh, you\xe2\x80\x99re my little homunculus.\nLeonard: Don\xe2\x80\x99t do that.\nPenny: Sorry. Okay, who wants syrup and who wants cinnamon sugar?\nSheldon: I want oatmeal.\nPenny: Yes, well, I want a boyfriend whose roommate isn\xe2\x80\x99t a giant pain in the ass.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that will happen soon enough. But in the meantime, I still want oatmeal.\nPenny: You know what, I give up. He\xe2\x80\x99s impossible.\nSheldon: I can\xe2\x80\x99t be impossible. I exist. I believe what you meant to say is, \xe2\x80\x9cI give up, he\xe2\x80\x99s improbable.\xe2\x80\x9d\nLeonard: Sheldon, you really need to find a better way of dealing with Penny.\nSheldon: What am I supposed to do, eat French toast on a Monday? Now, that would be impossible.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m just saying, you can catch more flies with honey than with vinegar.\nSheldon: You can catch even more flies with manure. What\xe2\x80\x99s your point?\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s a\xe2\x80\xa6 (gives up)\nSheldon: Boy, that does smell good. Too bad it\xe2\x80\x99s Monday.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The apartment.\n  Penny: Okay, so Kim the night manager went on maternity leave, and her husband\xe2\x80\x99s name is Sandy, right? So get this, her replacement is a woman named Sandy whose husband\xe2\x80\x99s name is Kim.\nLeonard: Wow!\nPenny: I know. What are the odds?\nSheldon: Easily calculable, we begin by identifying the set of married couples with unisex names. We then eliminate those unqualified for restaurant work, the aged, the imprisoned and the limbless, for example. Next we look at\xe2\x80\xa6\nLeonard: Sheldon! it\xe2\x80\x99s an amazing coincidence, can we leave it at that?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. Ooh, Penny, it\xe2\x80\x99s as if the Cheesecake Factory is run by witches.\nPenny: Ooh, Sheldon, it\xe2\x80\x99s as if you don\xe2\x80\x99t think I\xe2\x80\x99ll punch you.\nLeonard: Come on, you guys, let it go.\nPenny: Fine, whatever. Are you finished?\nSheldon: Well, thank you. How thoughtful. Would you like a chocolate\nPenny: Um, yeah, sure, thanks.\nLeonard: What was that?\nSheldon: You said be nice to Penny. I believe offering chocolate to someone falls within the definition of nice.\nLeonard: It does. But in my experience, you don\xe2\x80\x99t.\nSheldon: There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy.\nLeonard: Yeah, yeah, now that\xe2\x80\x99s you, obnoxious and insufferable.\nHoward (arriving, in goth gear): What\xe2\x80\x99s going on, day dwellers?\nPenny: Oh, man, did the Kiss Army repeal don\xe2\x80\x99t ask, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell?\nHoward: No. Raj and I are going a goth club in Hollywood to hang with the night people. Anybody want to come along?\nPenny: Oh, wow, you\xe2\x80\x99re actually going out like that?\nHoward: No, no. I\xe2\x80\x99m going out like this. (Whips off jacket to reveal tattoos up both arms)\nLeonard: Howard, what did you do?\nHoward: They\xe2\x80\x99re called tattoo sleeves. Look. I bought them online, Raj got a set, too. Fantastic, right? Put them on, have hot sex with some freaky girl with her business pierced, take them off, and I can still be buried in a Jewish cemetery.\nSheldon: You know, I\xe2\x80\x99ve always wanted to go to a goth nighclub.\nHoward: Really?\nSheldon: Bazinga! None of you ever see my practical jokes coming, do you?\nHoward: Okay, how about you two? Look, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got some extra tat sleeves.\nLeonard: Why are you carrying extras?\nHoward: Well, In case I snag one on someone\xe2\x80\x99s nipple ring.\nPenny: Uh, yeah, I think we\xe2\x80\x99ll pass.\nHoward: Oh, is the missus speaking for the couple now?\nLeonard: In this case, you bet she is.\nHoward (after Raj whispers): Yes, she\xe2\x80\x99s pushy and yes, he\xe2\x80\x99s whipped, but that\xe2\x80\x99s not the expression. Come on, I want to stop at Walgreens and pick up some more eyeliner.\nLeonard: They\xe2\x80\x99re gonna get beaten up at that club.\nPenny: They\xe2\x80\x99re gonna get beaten up at Walgreens. Oh, sorry, Sheldon, I almost sat in your spot.\nSheldon: Did you? I didn\xe2\x80\x99t notice. Have a chocolate.\nPenny: Thank you.\nScene: The goth club.\n  Raj: I think we\xe2\x80\x99re fitting in quite nicely.\nHoward: It\xe2\x80\x99d help if you weren\xe2\x80\x99t drinking light beer.\nRaj: Oh, what\xe2\x80\x99s so gothic about vodka and cranberry juice?\nHoward: Hello, it looks like blood. Did you even read the Wiki How link I sent you on being goth?\nRaj: No, I\xe2\x80\x99m behind on my wiki-reading I\xe2\x80\x99m kind of on a John Grisham kick right now.\nHoward: What?\nRaj: Well, I finished reading The Pelican Brief and loved it so much, I dived right into The Client. He was a lawyer himself so his novels are accurate as well as entertaining.\nHoward: Just remember we are lost boys, children of the night.\nRaj: Great. Lost boys, children of the night. Got it. Can you pass the Chex mix, please. Thank you. We are lost boys.\nGirl: Good for you.\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m actually much morelost than he is.\nGirl: Nice ink.\nHoward: Thanks. Can we buy you ladies a drink?\nGirl: Two light beers.\nRaj: Light beers? Well, Wiki-how about that?\nSecond girl: What\xe2\x80\x99s your names?\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m Howard.\nRaj: Raj.\nGirl: I\xe2\x80\x99m Bethany.\nHoward: Nice to meet you, Bethany.\nRaj: Yes, very nice.\nBethany: Nice to meet you too.\nSecond girl: I\xe2\x80\x99m Sarah. Not that anyone cares.\nRaj: Do either of you ladies enjoy the novels of John Grisham?\nScene: The apartment.\nPenny: What\xe2\x80\x99s this cartoon called again?\nLeonard: Oshikuru: Demon Samurai.\nSheldon: And it\xe2\x80\x99s not a cartoon, it\xe2\x80\x99s anime.\nPenny: Anime. You know, I knew a girl in high school named Anna May. Anna May Fletcher. She was born with one nostril. Then she had this bad nose job and basically wound up with three.\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re here a lot now.\nPenny: Oh, am I talking too much? I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. Zip.\nSheldon: Thank you. Chocolate?\nPenny: Yes please. (Her phone rings) Oh. Hey, Kim. Yeah, I\xe2\x80\xa6 (sees Sheldon looking disapprovingly) You know what, hold on, let me take this in the hall. (Sheldon silently offers her another chocolate. She takes it.) You\xe2\x80\x99ll never guess who they got to replace you at work\xe2\x80\xa6\nLeonard: Okay, I know what you\xe2\x80\x99re doing.\nSheldon: Really?\nLeonard: Yes, you\xe2\x80\x99re using chocolates as positive reinforcement for what you consider correct behaviour.\nSheldon: Very good. Chocolate?\nLeonard: No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want any chocolate! Sheldon, you can\xe2\x80\x99t train my girlfriend like a lab rat.\nSheldon: Actually, it turns out I can.\nLeonard: Well, you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t.\nSheldon: There\xe2\x80\x99s just no pleasing you, is there, Leonard? You weren\xe2\x80\x99t happy with my previous approach to dealing with her, so I decided to employ operant conditioning techniques, building on the work of Thorndike and B.F. Skinner. By this time next week, I believe I can have her jumping out of a pool, balancing a beach ball on her nose.\nLeonard: No, this has to stop now.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m not suggesting we really make her jump out of a pool. I thought the \xe2\x80\x9cbazinga\xe2\x80\x9d was implied. I\xe2\x80\x99m just tweaking her personality, sanding off the rough edges if you will.\nLeonard: No, you\xe2\x80\x99re not sanding Penny.\nSheldon: Are you saying that I\xe2\x80\x99m forbidden from applying a harmless, scientifically valid protocol that will make our lives better?\nLeonard: Yes, you\xe2\x80\x99re forbidden.\nSheldon (Squirting him with a water spray): Bad Leonard.\nScene: The goth club.\n  Bethany: So what do you guys do?\nHoward: Oh, you know, goth stuff. Goth magazines, goth music.\nRaj: Goth food.\nSarah: What\xe2\x80\x99s goth food?\nRaj: Uh\xe2\x80\xa6 blackened salmon?\nBethany: No, I meant what do you do for jobs?\nRaj: Oh, we\xe2\x80\x99re scientists.\nHoward: Yeah, you know, the dark sciences.\nBethany: What are the dark sciences\nRaj: Well, I am an astrophysicist and a lot of that takes place at night. When there are vampires and miscellaneous undead out and about.\nHoward: Oy vay.\nRaj: That sounds really cool.\nHoward: Does it? Okay, if you like space stuff, I design components for the international space station. Which is in space. Where, as I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you know, no one can hear you scream.\nRaj: So what do you gals do?\nBethany: I work at the Gap.\nHoward: Really? How about that? I\xe2\x80\x99ve been to the Gap.\nRaj: Yeah, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been there as well. I like your tee-shirts with the little pocket.\nSarah: I work there too. Not that anyone cares. You know, this place is boring.\nBethany: Yeah. Why don\xe2\x80\x99t we go somewhere else and have some fun?\nHoward: Okay.\nRaj: Sure, we like fun.\nHoward: We are fun people.\nRaj: Dark and fun.\nBethany: Come on, I know a place you\xe2\x80\x99ll really dig.\nHoward: Did you bring the black condoms?\nRaj: In my fanny pack.\nHoward: Let\xe2\x80\x99s go.\nScene: A tattoo parlour. Bethany is getting a tattoo.\n  Raj: Are you happy now?\nHoward: Not particularly.\nScene: The apartment.\n  Penny (voice outside door): Oh\xe2\x80\x99 my God, she didn\xe2\x80\x99t!\nLeonard: What could she possibly be talking about for so long?\nSheldon: Obviously, waitressing at the Cheesecake Factory is a complex socioeconomic activity, that requires a great deal of analysis and planning. Bazinga! You know, using positive reinforcement techniques, I could train that behaviour out of her in a week.\nLeonard: No.\nSheldon: If you let me use negative reinforcement, I can get it done before we go to bed.\nLeonard: You\xe2\x80\x99re not squirting her in the face with water.\nSheldon: No, of course not. We\xe2\x80\x99re talking very mild electric shocks. No tissue damage whatsoever.\nLeonard: Forget it.\nSheldon: Oh, come on, you can\xe2\x80\x99t tell me that you\xe2\x80\x99re not intrigued about the possibility of building a better girlfriend.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m not. And Penny\xe2\x80\x99s qualities, both good and bad, are what make her who she is.\nSheldon: You mean, like that high-pitched, irritating laugh?\nLeonard: Yes.\nSheldon You wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t prefer a throaty chuckle?\nLeonard: You\xe2\x80\x99re not changing how Penny laughs.\nSheldon: No, that would be incongruous, I was going to lower the whole voice to a more pleasing register.\nPenny (entering): Uh, sorry guys, that girl is (high pitched) freaky!\nSheldon: Come again?\nPenny (normal voice): Freaky.\nSheldon (lower voice): Freaky?\nPenny (lower voice): Yeah, freaky.\nSheldon: Have a chocolate.\nPenny: Thank you.\nScene: The tattoo parlour. Howard is laying down, preparing to have a tattoo on his lower back.\nRaj: Are you seriously going to deface your body just for the possibility you could have cheap sex with a strange girl you met in a bar?\nHoward: Uh, yeah!\nRaj: What is your mother going to say?\nHoward: She\xe2\x80\x99s not going to see it. She takes my temperature orally now.\nBethany: What are you going to get, Howard?\nHoward: Well, I can\xe2\x80\x99t really decide between a screaming devil, this mean little skull or Kermit the Frog.\nBethany: Kermit the Frog?\nHoward: You know (Kermit voice) Hi ho, I\xe2\x80\x99m on Howard\xe2\x80\x99s butt!\nBethany: Get the mean little skull, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll see if I can make him smile.\nHoward: Yeah, I\xe2\x80\x99d like the mean little skull, please.\nSarah: What are you going to get, Raj?\nRaj: With my luck, hepatitis\nTattooist: Okay, here we go.\nHoward: Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!\nTattooist: That\xe2\x80\x99s just rubbing alcohol.\nHoward: I know, but it was cold. Ow, ow, ow!\nTattooist: I\xe2\x80\x99m putting on the stencil.\nHoward: What comes after the stencil?\nTattooist: This.\nHoward: Aaaaaargh! Okay, that\xe2\x80\x99s it, no needle, no pain, no tattoo.\nBethany: What\xe2\x80\x99s the big deal, you\xe2\x80\x99ve done this before.\nHoward: No, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t, look. (Rips off tattoo sleeves) I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, I\xe2\x80\x99m a fraud, he\xe2\x80\x99s a fraud.\nRaj: We\xe2\x80\x99re both frauds.\nHoward: Yeah, I think I covered that.\nRaj: But I was summing up.\nHoward: We\xe2\x80\x99re not goth, we\xe2\x80\x99re just guys.\nRaj: Very, very smart guys.\nBethany: So you were totally scamming us?\nHoward: Yes. And I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t blame you if you walked out of here and never wanted to see us again. Unless of course our bold honesty has suddenly made us attractive.\nBethany: I\xe2\x80\x99m leaving.\nSarah: I\xe2\x80\x99m leaving too. Not that anyone cares.\nRaj: When we tell this story, let\xe2\x80\x99s end it differently.\nHoward: What are you thinking? Maybe a big musical number?\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to make some warm milk and then turn in. I trust if you two are planning in engaging in amorous activites, you\xe2\x80\x99ll keep the decibel level to a minimum.\nPenny: Of course.\nSheldon: Thank you. (Throws a chocolate. Penny catches it in her mouth)\n  Penny: Mmm, these are so good\nLeonard: Unbelievable.\nPenny: What?\nLeonard: I was just thinking, we should probably turn in too.\nPenny: well, my new bed got delivered, if you come over and put it together, you can stay at my place.\nLeonard: Really, that\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of work, and it\xe2\x80\x99s kind of late.\nPenny: Yeah, but if we stay there, we won\xe2\x80\x99t have to be quiet.\nLeonard: Let\xe2\x80\x99s go.\nSheldon: Interesting. Sex works even better than chocolate to modify behaviour. I wonder if anyone else has stumbled on to that.\nScene: Raj\xe2\x80\x99s car.\n  Howard: Okay, wait, how about this? We say there were four goth girls, the two girls in the club had two friends.\nRaj: I like it, I like it. Did they smell good despite their gothlike nature?\nHoward: What\xe2\x80\x99s that got to do with the story?\nRaj: Engaging my olfactory sense helps make it real for me.\nHoward: Fine, they smelled good.\nRaj: Oh, they did. Like jasmine and honeysuckle.\nHoward: Whatever.\nRaj: And then they held hands and did a sexy, demonic hokey-pokey for us.\nHoward: No, no. Look, let me say my story all the way through, and then you can say yours, and then we\xe2\x80\x99ll pick.\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. Go on.\nHoward: Okay. We got tattoos, and then the four girls took us to their place.\nRaj: But we don\xe2\x80\x99t have tattoos. What if someone asks to see our tattoos?\nHoward: We say they\xe2\x80\x99re in a very intimate area.\nRaj: Oh, we are bad boys, aren\xe2\x80\x99t we?\nHoward: Right, right, so we go back to their place, and then the six of us end up in a hot tub.\nRaj: But we just got tattoos. Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t we be concerned about bacterial infection?\nHoward: True. Okay, forget the hot tub. The point is, we each have a m\xc3\xa9nage with sexy goth girls.\nRaj: Wow. What a great night.\nHoward: Yeah. Hey, want to try a country bar tomorrow night.\nRaj: Yeah, maybe we\xe2\x80\x99ll get lucky with some sexy cowgirls.\nHoward: Could happen.\nRaj: I wonder how they smell.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
