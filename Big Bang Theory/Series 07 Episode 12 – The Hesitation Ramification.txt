b'Scene: The apartment.\nAmy: This is nice, that we all get to eat together.\nLeonard: Absolutely.\nAmy: Hmm. Can we maybe put the phones down and have an actualhuman conversation?\nSheldon: We can, but thanks to Steve Jobs, we don\xe2\x80\x99t have to.\nPenny: Guys, guys, you\xe2\x80\x99re never gonna believe this.\nLeonard: What happened?\nPenny: I just got a part on a TV show.\nAmy: Congratulations.\nLeonard: What? That\xe2\x80\x99s great. Guys.\nHoward: Oh, yeah\nSheldon: Yay, Penny.\nAmy: What\xe2\x80\x99s the show?\nPenny: Um, NC\xe2\x80\xa6 II\xe2\x80\xa6 or, you know, NCSTD\xe2\x80\xa6 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, it\xe2\x80\x99s, it\xe2\x80\x99s, you know, it\xe2\x80\x99s the one with the letters and I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna be on it!\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99s amazing.\nPenny: Yeah.\nHoward: What\xe2\x80\x99s your part?\nPenny: Um, I play a customer in a diner and I flirt with Mark Harmon.\nRaj: Ooh, Mark Harmon, he\xe2\x80\x99s a dreamboat.\nLeonard: So it, it\xe2\x80\x99s just flirting?\nPenny: Well, yeah. Why?\nLeonard: Uh, no reason. I just think it\xe2\x80\x99s sexier when things are left to the imagination.\nAmy: He\xe2\x80\x99s wrong.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The Cheesecake Factory.\nRaj: So I read a study that says a man with a dog is three times more likely to get a woman\xe2\x80\x99s phone number.\nLeonard: Is it true even when the man lets his dog lick peanut butter off his tongue?\nRaj: I don\xe2\x80\x99t see why not.\nHoward: If you\xe2\x80\x99re really desperate to meet women and like having food eaten out of your mouth, I could set you up with my mom.\nSheldon: Why is that funny? That\xe2\x80\x99s just unhygienic.\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s a joke.\nSheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t think so. I believe that a joke is a brief oral narrative with a climactic humorous twist. For example, uh, Wolowitz\xe2\x80\x99s mother is so fat that she decided to go on a diet, or exercise, or both. See? The twist is that people don\xe2\x80\x99t usually change. Well, they don\xe2\x80\x99t.\nPenny: Hey, guys, don\xe2\x80\x99t forget, my episode\xe2\x80\x99s on TV tomorrow night.\nHoward: We\xe2\x80\x99ll be there.\nRaj: Can we bring anything?\nPenny: Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s so sweet of you, but I was gonna steal food from here. You know, my treat.\nSheldon: Wait, if Howard\xe2\x80\x99s mother is coming, then you should also steal marbles. Because she\xe2\x80\x99s obese, and hippos are obese, and in the popular board game Hungry Hungry Hippos, they eat marbles. Maybe I need to dumb these down for you.\nScene: The stairwell.\nSheldon: Leonard, do you think I\xe2\x80\x99m funny?\nLeonard: No. Do you?\nSheldon: I think I\xe2\x80\x99m hysterical.\nLeonard: I take it back. That was funny.\nSheldon: The philosopher Henri Bergson says it\xe2\x80\x99s funny when a human being behaves like an object.\nLeonard: I bet that bit killed at The Chuckle Hut.\nSheldon: Oh, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t perform stand-up comedy, he was a philosopher.\nLeonard: You know, I think we\xe2\x80\x99re zeroing in on your problem.\nSheldon: Perhaps I\xe2\x80\x99ll spend some time developing a unified theory of comedy, which will allow me to elicit laughter from anyone at any time. Unless they\xe2\x80\x99re German, \xe2\x80\x99cause that\xe2\x80\x99s a tough crowd.\nLeonard: Are you set on people laughing with you? \xe2\x80\x98Cause if you\xe2\x80\x99re cool with at you\xe2\x80\xa6\nSheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t get it.\nScene: Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s car.\nBernadette: Raj, when you said you were gonna bring a date to watch Penny\xe2\x80\x99s thing tonight, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t think you meant Stuart.\nHoward: Really? I never for a second thought it\xe2\x80\x99d be anything else.\nRaj: I almost met someone last night, but I blew it. I was walking Cinnamon and this girl introduced herself, but she was so cute I panicked and said, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it be easier if instead of talking we could just sniff each other\xe2\x80\x99s butts?\nBernadette: Well, Stuart\xe2\x80\x99s cute in his own way.\nStuart: When I was a baby, my mother called me her little possum.\nRaj: Are possums cute?\nStuart: Not at all.\nHoward: If you\xe2\x80\x99re so intimidated by talking to attractive girls, maybe you should practice by talking to regular people.\nRaj: You mean like fatties and uggos?\nBernadette: Or maybe just stop talking.\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m serious. Go to the mall, talk to anybody, practice, that way when you eventually do talk to a cute girl, it won\xe2\x80\x99t be so scary.\nBernadette: Or just keep dating the possum.\nScene: The apartment.\nVoice on television: Parsa doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have those kind of resources.\nSecond voice: No, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why he had Erin Pace rewire it\xe2\x80\xa6\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m so proud of you.\nPenny: We haven\xe2\x80\x99t even gotten to my scene yet.\nLeonard: I know, but you\xe2\x80\x99re going to be a TV star and you haven\xe2\x80\x99t left me yet. That takes guts.\nSheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know about you, but I\xe2\x80\x99m very uncomfortable with all this.\nAmy: Why?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen this show before and now I\xe2\x80\x99m starting with episode 246? It\xe2\x80\x99s unnatural.\nAmy: Just think of the first 245 as the prequel.\nSheldon: All right.\nPenny: Okay, shh, guys, guys, this is it.\nMan on TV: I guess it\xe2\x80\x99s you and me, kid.\nMark Harmon on TV: What are you doing?\nWoman on TV: I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to make peace.\nMark Harmon on TV: We\xe2\x80\x99re good.\nWoman on TV: Good.\nMark Harmon on TV: Really? Because\xe2\x80\xa6\nPenny: Are you kidding me?\nLeonard: What\xe2\x80\x99s wrong?\nPenny: Well, the diner scene. Where\xe2\x80\x99s my diner scene?\nSheldon: Well, don\xe2\x80\x99t ask me. Until I see the prequel, I\xe2\x80\x99m lost.\nPenny: No, there was supposed to be a big scene with me and Mark Harmon, but it\xe2\x80\x99s gone.\nBernadette: What happened?\nPenny: They must\xe2\x80\x99ve cut it.\nLeonard: Oh, Penny, I\xe2\x80\x99m, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.\nHoward: That stinks.\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you were great.\nPenny: This doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make any sense. I mean, I, I thought I did a, a really good job, I\xe2\x80\xa6 Excuse me.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99ve been studying how to make people laugh. They say that comedy is tragedy plus time. Let\xe2\x80\x99s tickle some ribs.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nPenny (on phone): No, Dad, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think they cut me out of the show because I was too pretty. No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t need you to come out and kick Mark Harmon\xe2\x80\x99s ass. Daddy, I gotta go. I love you. Bye.\nLeonard: How you doing?\nPenny: Ugh, this is such a disaster. My parents had all my relatives over. They got one of those six-foot sandwiches, and got my brother a day pass out of rehab and now he\xe2\x80\x99s missing and the sandwich is missing, and they\xe2\x80\x99re probably in Mexico by now. So humiliating.\nLeonard: You still got the part. That\xe2\x80\x99s a huge accomplishment.\nPenny: Yeah, but this was supposed to be my break, okay? People were gonna see me in this show and it was gonna lead to bigger things. More auditions, more parts. Now none of that\xe2\x80\x99s gonna happen.\nLeonard: Honey, you only had, like, three lines. That wasn\xe2\x80\x99t gonna happen anyway.\nPenny: Unbelievable.\nLeonard: Oh, come on, no, that\xe2\x80\x99s not what I meant.\nPenny: Then what did you mean?\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t, look, you know, words don\xe2\x80\x99t always have to mean things.\nPenny: I think you meant that you don\xe2\x80\x99t believe in me.\nLeonard: Nope. Uh, uh, I might not know what I meant, but I know that I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that. Not this guy. Oh, no way.\nPenny: I want you, right now, to give me your 100% honest opinion.\nLeonard: Right.\nPenny: Do you think I have what it takes to really make it as an actress?\nLeonard: Yes.\nPenny: So you think I\xe2\x80\x99ll be on TV and in movies and win awards.\nLeonard: Honestly?\nPenny: Yes, honestly.\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t.\nPenny: How could you say that?\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, I got all confused when you said honestly.\nPenny: Oh.\nLeonard: Look, do I think that you are talented and that you are beautiful? Of course I do. But isn\xe2\x80\x99t Los Angeles full of actresses who are just as talented, just as beautiful? All right, look, we\xe2\x80\x99ll come back to that.\nPenny: No, please. Don\xe2\x80\x99t stop, go on. Tell me how I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna be a waitress for the rest of my life.\nLeonard: That is not what I said. Look, I think you\xe2\x80\x99re really good. I truly do. But this is an incredibly hard thing that you\xe2\x80\x99re shooting for. I mean, the odds of anyone becoming a successful actor are like a million to one.\nPenny: Wow, thank you.\nLeonard: Should\xe2\x80\x99ve let Sheldon come.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: This is interesting. Apparently, a key component in some forms of humour is the element of surprise.\nAmy: Well, that makes sense. The prefrontal cortex is responsible for planning and anticipation, and patients with brain lesions on their\xe2\x80\xa6\nSheldon: BRAIN LESIONS!\nAmy: Sheldon, you scared me. That wasn\xe2\x80\x99t funny.\nSheldon: Or maybe you have a stick up your prefrontal cortex.\nAmy: Okay, the notion that you can read a few books and come up with a definitive theory of comedy is absurd. I mean, humour is a complex neurological\xe2\x80\xa6 (Sheldon drops his trousers) Okay, that\xe2\x80\x99s pretty good.\nSheldon: Excellent.\nScene: The mall.\nStuart: How about her?\nRaj: No. No pretty girls. The point is to talk to regular people and work our way up to pretty girls.\nStuart: Fine. How about that old lady with the walker?\nRaj: That depends. On any level, do you think she\xe2\x80\x99s hot?\nStuart: We\xe2\x80\x99ll find somebody else.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Kumquat?\nAmy: I guess.\nSheldon: Ointment?\nAmy: Sure.\nSheldon: Now, would you say ointment is more, equal to, or less funny than kumquat?\nAmy: I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I want to go out with you anymore.\nSheldon: Will you please stop joking around? I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to figure this out.\nAmy: Sheldon, how many words are you gonna go through?\nSheldon: All of them.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nPenny: You didn\xe2\x80\x99t get your part cut.\nVoice on TV: All right, baby, here\xe2\x80\x99s the deal.\nPenny: And you didn\xe2\x80\x99t get your part cut. Yep, bunch of old guys rocking out in a band, all with erectile dysfunction, you didn\xe2\x80\x99t get your part cut!\nLeonard: Hey. Can we talk?\nPenny: We can, but the part of Penny might get cut.\nLeonard: That was really crappy of me. What you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to do is hard, but people do make it, and I really do believe you could be one of them.\nPenny: Thank you.\nLeonard: And to show you how much I believe in you, I kind of got you an audition.\nPenny: Are you serious? For what?\nLeonard: The new Star Wars movie.\nPenny: What? How did you manage that?\nLeonard: There\xe2\x80\x99s this thing online, you put yourself on tape and just send it in, anyone can do it.\nPenny: Come on Leonard, this is just a PR stunt.\nLeonard: So? Even if it is, you have a huge advantage because you\xe2\x80\x99re an actual actress. Most of the people doing this are just weirdoes and nerds. Wolowitz sent his in two days ago.\nPenny: Really, let it go.\nLeonard: Look, maybe it is a long shot, but sometimes long shots happen. Luke Skywalker was only given one chance to destroy the Death Star. He had to get a torpedo into an exhaust port that was only two meters wide, but with the help of The Force, he\xe2\x80\xa6 wow, I can feel you hating me right now.\nScene: The mall.\nStuart: How about that lady in the sweat suit, speed-walking?\nRaj: Yeah, she seems friendly and easy to\xe2\x80\xa6 never mind, she\xe2\x80\x99s gone. You know, maybe talking to people is too hard.\nStuart: We could go over to that department store, practice on the mannequins.\nRaj: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. They\xe2\x80\x99re dressed very stylishly. They\xe2\x80\x99re probably stuck-up. This is ridiculous. The next person that walks by, no matter who it is, they\xe2\x80\x99re the one. We\xe2\x80\x99re gonna die here.\nScene: The Cheesecake Factory.\nAmy: Hello.\nBernadette: Hey.\nHoward: Where\xe2\x80\x99s Sheldon?\nAmy: He\xe2\x80\x99s home trying to use science to determine the basis of humour.\nBernadette: That\xe2\x80\x99s interesting.\nAmy: It\xe2\x80\x99s exhausting. Do you have any idea how hard it is to laugh at a knock-knock joke that starts with knock-knock-knock, Amy, knock-knock-knock, Amy, knock-knock-knock, Amy?\nBernadette: If you want him to stop, sometimes the easiest thing to do is just fake a laugh.\nHoward: Fake a laugh? Do you ever do that with me?\nBernadette: No, of course not.\nHoward: Well, I\xe2\x80\x99d be able to tell anyway.\nBernadette: I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you would.\nHoward: Please, I\xe2\x80\x99ve made plenty of girls laugh, sometimes just by asking them out. (Bernadette laughs uncontrollably) Yeah? Well, I fake my orgasms.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard (on phone): Yes, how much for a hundred long-stemmed red roses? Really? How much for three?\nPenny: Hey.\nLeonard: Yeah, I\xe2\x80\x99ll call you back.\nPenny: Look, I know you were just trying to help with your Star Wars thing. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to call it idiotic.\nLeonard: Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you called it idiotic.\nPenny: Oh. Sorry, I meant to. Anyway, um, I was just upset with myself. I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t mad at you. I just feel like everything is falling apart.\nLeonard: Come on. It\xe2\x80\x99s okay.\nPenny: No, it\xe2\x80\x99s not okay. Look at me, okay? I took a temp job as a waitress forever ago, and I\xe2\x80\x99m still doing it. I can\xe2\x80\x99t quit, because guess what? I can\xe2\x80\x99t do anything else. And I finally get my big break, and it goes away. I\xe2\x80\x99m such a mess.\nLeonard: No, you\xe2\x80\x99re not.\nPenny: Really? \xe2\x80\x98Cause this morning at Starbucks, a pair of old underwear fell out of my pant leg. And it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the only one in there.\nLeonard: Okay, listen to me, this is just a minor setback.\nPenny: No, it\xe2\x80\x99s not, okay? I\xe2\x80\x99ve been out here for, like, ten years. I\xe2\x80\x99ve nothing to show for it.\nLeonard: Well, you have me.\nPenny: You\xe2\x80\x99re right. I do have you. Mm. Let\xe2\x80\x99s get married.\nLeonard: What?\nPenny: Ooh. Leonard Hofstadter, will you marry me?\nLeonard: Um\xe2\x80\xa6\nPenny: Did you seriously just say um?\nLeonard: Look, you know I love you but, but you\xe2\x80\x99re, you\xe2\x80\x99re drunk and sad and feeling lost.\nPenny: Okay, so, so you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to marry me?\nLeonard: That is not what I said.\nPenny: No, forget it. I take it back. Offer\xe2\x80\x99s off the table.\nSheldon: Who\xe2\x80\x99s in the mood to laugh?\nLeonard: Really not a good time.\nSheldon: But I used science to construct the perfect joke.\nPenny: I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna go.\nLeonard: Penny, don\xe2\x80\x99t.\nPenny: No, no, I just need to be alone.\nSheldon: So, a sandwich, a rabbi and yo mama walk into a bar. Where are you going?\nLeonard: To my room.\nSheldon: Should I follow you?\nLeonard: No.\nSheldon: Leonard, wait.\nLeonard: What?\nSheldon: I forgot to tell you the sandwich is promiscuous.\nScene: The mall.\nStuart: How about those guys on that bench over there? They look pathetic. I bet we could talk to them.\nRaj: That\xe2\x80\x99s a mirror.\nStuart: Oh, yeah.\nSecurity Guard: Hey, fellas, mall\xe2\x80\x99s closing.\nRaj: Sorry.\nSecurity Guard: Yeah. Good night.\nRaj: Uh, excuse me.\nSecurity Guard: Yeah?\nRaj: Uh, do, do you like being a mall security guard?\nSecurity Guard: It\xe2\x80\x99s all right.\nRaj: Okay, nice talking to you.\nStuart: Smooth.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Can\xe2\x80\x99t sleep?\nLeonard: No.\nSheldon: Would you like to talk about it?\nLeonard: Penny proposed, and I didn\xe2\x80\x99t say yes.\nSheldon: Why not?\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99s a good question.\nSheldon: Does that mean the relationship is over?\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\nSheldon: Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you ask her?\nLeonard: Because I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid to know the answer.\nSheldon: Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99s it? You\xe2\x80\x99re not gonna make some dumb joke or some inappropriate comment?\nSheldon: No. You\xe2\x80\x99re my friend, and, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.\nLeonard: Did you just put a kick me sign on my back?\nSheldon: No. That wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be funny at all.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom.\nHoward: Star Wars audition, take one, starring Howard Joel Wolowitz, real-life astronaut. Vader is here, now, on this moon. I felt his presence. He\xe2\x80\x99s come for me. He can feel when I\xe2\x80\x99m near\xe2\x80\xa6\nBernadette: How many times do I have to tell you to replace the toilet paper when it\xe2\x80\x99s empty?\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m in the middle of something.\nBernadette: So am I.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
