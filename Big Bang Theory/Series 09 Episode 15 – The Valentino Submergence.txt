But I said it like a badass.\nPenny: All right, well, can\xe2\x80\x99t you, like, slip him some money or something?\nLeonard: Really? I\xe2\x80\x99ve never done that before. Does it work?\nPenny: Do people like money? Is that what you\xe2\x80\x99re asking?\nLeonard: A lot of attitude from the woman who thought MC squared was a rapper.\nPenny: Now, is that a smart thing to say on a holiday that\xe2\x80\x99s basically national sex night?\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.

Whenever things are going well, I always find a way to ruin it. You two look happy, how do you do it?\nAmy: I, I think it starts with good communication.\nSheldon: You know what, that\xe2\x80\x99s not a flag question. Next caller.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s house.\nHoward: I hope you don\xe2\x80\x99t think I\xe2\x80\x99m just saying this because it\xe2\x80\x99s Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s Day, but, I love you so much.\nBernadette: I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna put this down your robe. It\xe2\x80\x99s not moving, but I think it\xe2\x80\x99s still alive.\nHoward: Well, should we put it back in there a few minutes?\nBernadette: No. No, and it\xe2\x80\x99s not a rat, it\xe2\x80\x99s a rabbit. We need to save it.\nHoward: Well, how do we do that?\nBernadette: Um, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, look it up on your phone.

I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna say check.\nBernadette: Anything else?\nHoward: To make sure it\xe2\x80\x99s not dehydrated, feed him an electrolyte solution. If it\xe2\x80\x99s not responding, use a warm cloth to wash its face and genitals. Yeah.\nScene: The restaurant.\nPenny: This is ridiculous. You know, I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna go talk to the ma\xc3\xaetre d\xe2\x80\x99.\nLeonard: What are you gonna say?\nPenny: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I\xe2\x80\x99m, I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna flirt with him.\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if I\xe2\x80\x99m comfortable with that.\nPenny: I\xe2\x80\x99m still sleeping with you tonight.\nLeonard: See if you can get a table by the window.\nPenny: Hi there. What\xe2\x80\x99s your name?\nMaitre d\xe2\x80\x99: Glen.\nPenny: Oh, boy, it is crazy in here tonight, huh, Glen?\nMaitre d\xe2\x80\x99: Well, you know, Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s Day.\nPenny: Yes.

Let\xe2\x80\x99s go.\nScene: The apartment.\nAmy: Rajesh, it\xe2\x80\x99s perfectly normal to have doubts after breaking up with someone.\nRaj (voice): You really think so?\nSheldon: Yeah, you know what\xe2\x80\x99s not normal? Blubbering about emotions during a flag show. Unless that emotion is excitement over New Zealand changing their flag. Yeah, good luck, you crazy Kiwis, we\xe2\x80\x99re rooting for you.\nAmy: Your friend is hurting.\nRaj: No, Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s right. Emily did say I always talk about my feelings too much.\nSheldon: I suppose that could be a legitimate concern in a relationship. Uh, perhaps even a, a red flag. And speaking of red flags, check out this sexy number from the former Soviet Union. Hubba, hubba.\nAmy: Oh. Uh, we-we have another caller. Hi. You\xe2\x80\x99re on Fun with Flags.\nBarry (voice): Hewwo. I want to talk about how wonewy I am, too.\nRaj: Kripke? Is that you?\nBarry: Yeah, I\xe2\x80\x99m just sitting here all by myself wondering if I\xe2\x80\x99w ever find someone to share my wife with. Pwefewabwy Asian, 18-24, no fatties.\nSheldon: Please, all comments and questions should be flag-related.\nBarry: Aw wight. Is my pole fwag-wewated?\nSheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t see why not.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s house.\nBernadette: He\xe2\x80\x99s eating. That\xe2\x80\x99s a good sign.\nHoward: You\xe2\x80\x99re gonna have to wait one hour until you can go swimming again.\nBernadette: He\xe2\x80\x99s pretty cute.\nHoward: He is. Should we name him?\nBernadette: It is Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s Day. How about Valentino?\nHoward: Nice. A classic rabbit name. Peter Rabbit, Roger Rabbit. Valentino Wolowitz Rabbit. Oh, look at all that chest hair and overbite. Of course you\xe2\x80\x99re a Wolowitz. Son of a bitch, he bit me.\nBernadette: Are you okay?\nHoward: No, I\xe2\x80\x99m not okay. Wild rabbits can have rabies.\nBernadette: Oh. Well, why did you put your finger near its mouth?\nHoward: Poor judgement, obviously.\nBernadette: He\xe2\x80\x99s so little. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure it\xe2\x80\x99s fine.\nHoward: How can it be fine? I just got attacked by a clearly anti-Semitic wild animal.\nScene: Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s car.\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s not what we planned, but this isn\xe2\x80\x99t so bad, right?\nPenny: It is freaking amazing.\nLeonard: Well, glad you\xe2\x80\x99re feeling better.\nPenny: I was just hungry and cranky, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve never been called ma\xe2\x80\x99am before.\nLeonard: Is that a big deal?\nPenny: Kind of. When was the first time someone called you sir?\nLeonard: Sixth grade, but I wore a sport coat and carried a briefcase, so\xe2\x80\xa6\nPenny: Can you believe when I met you I was 22? I mean, it\xe2\x80\x99s crazy. Where did all that time go?\nLeonard: Mm, you watched The Bachelor a lot.\nPenny: Yeah, go ahead and make jokes, but your thirties are almost over.\nLeonard: No, they\xe2\x80\x99re not.\nPenny: You\xe2\x80\x99re closer to 40 than you are 30.\nLeonard: Ha, ha. You married an old man. Tell you what. Let\xe2\x80\x99s do something fun tonight.\nPenny: Won\xe2\x80\x99t make us any younger.\nLeonard: Well, maybe not, but some day we actually will be old, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll look back on this night and remember what a good time we had.\nPenny: Okay, like what?\nLeonard: I know. Food fight. I\xe2\x80\x99ll keep thinking.\nScene: The apartment.\nAmy: Look, I know you both feel bad about being alone, but sometimes the best thing you can do is take a little time for yourself, especially when you just got out of a relationship.\nSheldon: Speaking of ending relationships, when British Honduras became Belize, they designed a new flag with a tree on it, and I would like to hang myself from that tree.\nRaj: But, Amy, when you and Sheldon split up, didn\xe2\x80\x99t you start dating someone right away?\nAmy: Well, I, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say right away.\nSheldon: And actually, it was three different men.\nBarry: Thwee diffewent men? Damn, girl, way to give the milk away?\nAmy: Oh, looks like we just lost Kripke.\nBarry: No, actuawwy, I\xe2\x80\x99m stiw here.\nAmy: Now?\nBarry: Yup.\nAmy: Now?\nBarry: Yup.\nAmy: Now? Oh, looks like we just lost Kripke.\nRaj: Before Emily, I was alone for so long. I just, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if I can do that again.\nSheldon: Well, you know, here is something that might cheer you up. The flag of the Isle of Man is nothing but three legs sharing a weird pair of underpants, so you think you got problems.\nAmy: I have an idea. Maybe someone in our audience would be interested in meeting Rajesh. Ladies, I can attest that he is a kind, handsome, intelligent\xe2\x80\xa6\nRaj: Rich parents, don\xe2\x80\x99t forget, rich parents.\nAmy: \xe2\x80\xa6spoiled astrophysicist who not only\xe2\x80\xa6 oh. Well, that was quick. Hi. You\xe2\x80\x99re on Fun with Flags.\nBarry: Hey, I think I got cut off.\nAmy: Hello, Kripke.\nBarry: I have a fwag question. How many men did you have sex with?\nScene: Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s car.\nLeonard: Let\xe2\x80\x99s see. What\xe2\x80\x99s young and fun? Uh, we could go dancing.\nLeonard: Are you actually gonna dance?\nLeonard: Of course.\nPenny: Yeah. No one wants to see that. Hey, how about skinny dipping at the beach?\nLeonard: No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t need any fish nibbling my business.\nPenny: Oh, there\xe2\x80\x99s a screening of Moulin Rouge, I heard the crowd sings along and stuff.\nLeonard: That sounds fun. When\xe2\x80\x99s it start?\nPenny: Midnight.\nLeonard: Midnight. Really? You know what? Let\xe2\x80\x99s do it.\nPenny: Okay, great. Oh, wait. Uh, it\xe2\x80\x99s sold out.\nLeonard: Oh, thank God.\nPenny: Yes.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s house.\nHoward: It says, rabies in rabbits is highly unlikely.\nBernadette: Oh, terrific.\nHoward: It\xe2\x80\x99s not terrific. Lots of highly unlikely things happen. You saw what\xe2\x80\x99s under this robe, and you still married me.\nBernadette: If you\xe2\x80\x99re really worried, we\xe2\x80\x99ll take him to the vet and have him tested.\nHoward: Good. Thank you. Oh, okay, there is a test. All they have to do is cut off his head and check his brain.\nBernadette: Oh, cut off his head? That\xe2\x80\x99s where his little nose is.\nHoward: He\xe2\x80\x99s not showing any symptoms. I guess I\xe2\x80\x99ll just go to the emergency room to be safe.\nBernadette: Howie, this is just your hypochondria.\nHoward: No, when I sat on the mute button and thought I\xe2\x80\x99d gone deaf, that was my hypochondria.\nBernadette: We\xe2\x80\x99ll find another time to tell him I\xe2\x80\x99m pregnant.\nScene: The apartment.\nRaj (voice): I mean, this is the first time I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever broken up with someone. I just, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t realize it was gonna hurt this much.\nAmy: It really can.\nSheldon: All right. Nothing about this is fun. No one wants to talk about flags, and I haven\xe2\x80\x99t spoken in over ten minutes, so, enjoy your new show, Internet. Dr. Amy Farrah Flower present with.\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry for bothering you. I\xe2\x80\x99ll hang up now.\nAmy: No, hold on, Rajesh. You know, you\xe2\x80\x99re not being very sympathetic. You know first hand that breakups are hard.\nSheldon: Fine. If you insist on making me a part of this, yes, I knowledge how painful they can be. However, pain has an evolutionary purpose. It provides information from the environment that, uh, behaviour isn\xe2\x80\x99t good for us.\nBarry: Wike when I feww in wove with that stwipper and bought her a Pwius.\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99m just gonna push all the buttons.\nSheldon: Raj, now, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry you\xe2\x80\x99re suffering. When Amy and I were broken up, I also suffered. And this may sound surprising, but I\xe2\x80\x99m grateful for having gone through it.\nAmy: Really?\nSheldon: Yes. I believe our relationship now is stronger than ever.\nAmy: So do I.\nSheldon: When, when we were apart, I learned how important you are to me. And I realize that when two people are in love, sometimes they\xe2\x80\xa6\nLeonard and Penny: Happy Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s Day!\nLeonard: We are young and fun.\nSheldon: I stand corrected. Fun.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Congratulations on a successful live show.\nAmy: And a lovely Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s Day.\nPenny: Cleaning up is not young and fun.\nLeonard: It can be. Confetti fight. Maybe you should take a break. I got this.\nSheldon: Did you know the singular of confetti is confetto?\nAmy: Interesting, and when would you use the singular?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m glad you asked. Amy, you have a confetto in your nose. No, no, no, no. Other side. There you go.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
