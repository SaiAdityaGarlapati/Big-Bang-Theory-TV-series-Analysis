b'Scene: The apartment.\nLeonard: The interface is pretty simple. You put your horizontal X coordinate here, vertical Y coordinate here. When you\xe2\x80\x99re happy with those, you press this button.\nPenny: Got it.\nSheldon: Leonard, you\xe2\x80\x99ll never guess who I just found online. Hey!\nLeonard: Nice shot.\nPenny: Eh, his giant head did most of the work.\nSheldon: Very mature. You\xe2\x80\x99re lucky I\xe2\x80\x99m out of silly string. As I was saying, Leonard, you\xe2\x80\x99ll never guess who I just found online. Professor Proton.\nLeonard: You\xe2\x80\x99re kidding. He\xe2\x80\x99s still alive?\nSheldon: Yes.\nPenny: Who\xe2\x80\x99s Professor Proton?\nLeonard: He was the host of this great\xe2\x80\xa6 Hey!\nPenny: Yes! Sorry, tell me about Professor Proton.\nSheldon: Professor Proton hosted my favourite science show when I was a child. I never missed an episode. He demonstrated scientific principles using everyday objects.\nLeonard: It was pretty cool.\nPenny: Aw, so cute when you use the word cool wrong. Like when kids say pasghetti.\nSheldon: Oh, dear lord, Leonard, look. He\xe2\x80\x99s still available for parties and events. We should hire him.\nLeonard: Hire him to do what?\nSheldon: Well, whatever we want. Hang out, do experiments, make him take 12 pictures with us so we can make a calendar.\nLeonard: It would be pretty awesome to hang out with him. I just used awesome wrong, didn\xe2\x80\x99t I?\nSheldon: Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m e-mailing him right now.\nLeonard: Do you remember his old theme song?\nSheldon: Of course I do.\nTogether: Grab your goggles, put your lab coat on, here he comes, Professor Proton.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The cafeteria.\nRaj: Hey, I just found out I have to be at the telescope lab all weekend. Any chance you and Bernadette could take care of my dog?\nHoward: Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you put her in a kennel?\nRaj: Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you put your mother in a home?\nHoward: To be honest, she\xe2\x80\x99d do better in the kennel. I\xe2\x80\x99ll talk to Bernie. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure it\xe2\x80\x99s fine.\nRaj: Thank you.\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s happening. Leonard, it\xe2\x80\x99s happening. Professor Proton is coming to our house.\nLeonard: You\xe2\x80\x99re kidding.\nHoward: You mean the guy who used to host that lame kids show?\nSheldon: And you just got yourself uninvited. See? I told you I\xe2\x80\x99d find a tactful way to do that.\nHoward: How\xe2\x80\x99d you get him to come to your house?\nSheldon: As Professor Proton always says, there is no problem you can\xe2\x80\x99t solve if you use your noggin.\nLeonard: And he wrote him a cheque.\nSheldon: Yeah, that, too. Big cheque.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nRaj: Uncle Howard. Cinnamon\xe2\x80\x99s here for her sleepover party.\nHoward: You know if you had a stroke, she\xe2\x80\x99d eat you, right?\nRaj: And it would be my pleasure to be her num-num.\nHoward: Okay, so what do I need to know to take care of her?\nRaj: It\xe2\x80\x99s very simple. For breakfast, she has an egg-white frittata. Feel free to give her a choice of home fries or an English muffin, but not both. We\xe2\x80\x99re watching our weight. Uh, for dinner, something simple, a veal chop, some scampi, whatever you like.\nHoward: Classy dog.\nRaj: Yes. Also, don\xe2\x80\x99t forget to close the toilet or she\xe2\x80\x99ll drink out of it.\nHowatd: I feel for ya. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a psychotic mommy, too.\nScene: Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom.\nSheldon (off): Leonard, are you in bed?\nLeonard: Yes.\nSheldon (off): Me, too.\nLeonard: Great.\nSheldon (off): I can\xe2\x80\x99t sleep.\nLeonard: Well, I can, so shut up.\nSheldon (off): Do you realize that in less than nine hours, Arthur Jeffries, aka Professor Proton, will be in our apartment?\nLeonard: Sheldon, you know that if you stay up all night, you\xe2\x80\x99re gonna be sleepy tomorrow. And a sleepy Sheldon is a cranky Sheldon. And a cranky Sheldon is actually no different than a regular Sheldon. Good night.\nSheldon (off): I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking of wearing a tuxedo.\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99s not ridiculous. Good night.\nSheldon (off): Do you have cufflinks?\nLeonard: No.\nSheldon (off): Ah, just as well. Where can you rent a tuxedo at three o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning?\nLeonard: Okay, good night.\nSheldon (off): Nice to meet you, Professor Proton. Nice to meet you, Professor Proton. Nice to meet you, Professor Proton. Nice to meet you, Prof\xe2\x80\xa6 Ow! Leonard?\nLeonard: What?\nSheldon (off): I still can\xe2\x80\x99t sleep.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nHoward: She really tuckered herself out at the park, huh?\nBernadette: Yeah, you two were so cute playing together.\nHoward: It was kind of fun throwing a ball and not having anyone laugh at me.\nBernadette: And you were sweet not to throw it too far so she didn\xe2\x80\x99t wear out her tiny legs.\nHoward: Yeah, that\xe2\x80\x99s what I was doing.\nBernadette: You know, there were a few moments today when I almost felt like we were a little family.\nHoward: Really?\nBernadette: Yeah. I never thought of myself as a mom, but when the three of us were out there having fun, I felt like maybe someday we could do it.\nHoward: Of course we can. Especially if our baby\xe2\x80\x99s as calm and quiet as little Cinna\xe2\x80\xa6 Son of a bitch, she\xe2\x80\x99s gone.\nBernadette: Where\xe2\x80\x99d she go?\nHoward: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, she didn\xe2\x80\x99t leave a note.\nBernadette: Well, you were the one who was supposed to put her back in the stroller.\nHoward: No, I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t. You were.\nBernadette: No, I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t.\nHoward: Yes, you were!.\nBernadette: Yeah, well, you throw like a girl.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m getting worried.\nPenny: Relax, Sheldon, he\xe2\x80\x99s only a few minutes late.\nSheldon: Professor Proton was never late when he was on TV. You know, every day, four o\xe2\x80\x99clock, he was there. Unless tornadoes were ripping apart East Texas, in which case we\xe2\x80\x99d join him in progress. (Phone rings) It\xe2\x80\x99s him. Hello. Well, I see. Yes. All right, we can come get you. Yeah, well, see you soon. Bye.\nLeonard: Where is he?\nSheldon: The third floor landing. The poor old guy\xe2\x80\x99s been walking up the stairs for half an hour. It\xe2\x80\x99s really you.\n(On the third floor landing)\nLeonard: Mr. Jeffries, I am so sorry. We should\xe2\x80\x99ve told you about the broken elevator.\nArthur: I agree.\nSheldon: Professor Proton, it\xe2\x80\x99s an honour to meet you.\nArthur: Just, just call me Arthur.\nSheldon: Leonard, you hear that? Professor Proton said I should call him Arthur. That means we\xe2\x80\x99re friends.\nArthur: No. A friend would\xe2\x80\x99ve, would\xe2\x80\x99ve told me about the elevator.\nSheldon: Look at me. I can get as close to you as I want without my mom saying it\xe2\x80\x99s going to ruin my eyes.\nArthur: Is, uh, is he dangerous?\nLeonard: Actually, he\xe2\x80\x99s a genius.\nSheldon: I am.\nArthur: That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t answer my question.\nLeonard: Mr. Jeffries, I\xe2\x80\x99m, I\xe2\x80\x99m Leonard. This is my girlfriend, Penny.\nArthur: Hi.\nPenny: Hello.\nArthur: Well, I hope I haven\xe2\x80\x99t, uh, kept the kids waiting too long for, for the show.\nSheldon: Oh, no, there are no kids. No, the, the show\xe2\x80\x99s for me. Come on. I\xe2\x80\x99ll race ya, Arthur.\nArthur: Is the, is the blonde girl really your, your girlfriend?\nLeonard: Yes, sir.\nArthur: You\xe2\x80\x99re the genius.\n(Back in the Apartment)\nPenny: So, do you do a lot of appearances like this?\nArthur: It, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to say. I\xe2\x80\x99m, I\xe2\x80\x99m still trying to figure out what, what th, what this is.\nLeonard: We just wanted to hang out with you and maybe learn a little about your life.\nArthur: Well, there, there really isn\xe2\x80\x99t too much to tell. After the TV show was, was cancelled, nobody in the scientific world would, uh, would take me seriously. So I was forced to do these, uh, children\xe2\x80\x99s parties to, to make a living.\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99s too bad. But still, working with kids, it must be rewarding.\nArthur: You, you get bit a lot. Let me see if, if I have this straight. You, you two are, are physicists, and you, and you want me to do a children\xe2\x80\x99s science show?\nSheldon: Yes. And if there\xe2\x80\x99s time, take 12 pictures with us in seasonal clothing.\nArthur: You know, I\xe2\x80\x99m a real scientist. I, I have a PhD from Cornell University.\nSheldon: Yeah, that\xe2\x80\x99s great. Did you bring your puppet?\nArthur: No, no. I, I hate that puppet.\nSheldon: Oh, no. How could anybody hate Gino the Neutrino? It\xe2\x80\x99s nice, huh? I got him for 20 bucks on eBay. Including the shipping!\nArthur: I\xe2\x80\x99m, I\xe2\x80\x99m awake, right? Th, this is happening?\nScene: Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s car.\nBernadette: Cinnamon!\nHoward: Cinnamon!\nBernadette: You know, maybe she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t recognize her name because of Raj\xe2\x80\x99s accent.\nHoward: Good thinking. (In a bad Indian accent) Cinnamon, come to Daddy.\nBernadette (likewise): Cinnamon. Where are you, my little lamb chop?\nHoward: Nice.\nBernadette: Thanks.\nHoward: When this all blows over, remember that voice. It\xe2\x80\x99s kind of a turn-on.\nBernadette: It turns you on when I sound like Raj?\nHoward: Cinnamon!\nScene: The apartment.\nArthur: Okay, as, as I put the egg on top, and, and the flame goes out and, and, and the air pressure decreases in, in the flask, what do you think will happen?\nPenny: I think I know.\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s gonna get sucked in. It\xe2\x80\x99s going to get sucked in.\nPenny: Okay, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know.\nSheldon: Yes.\nPenny: See, I\xe2\x80\x99m not a scientist like them.\nArthur: I, I figured that out.\nSheldon: Potato clock. Do potato clock.\nPenny: What\xe2\x80\x99s that?\nArthur: I, I power a clock with a, with a potato.\nPenny: Shut up. You can do that? I mean, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t that solve the world\xe2\x80\x99s energy crisis?\nArthur: No. Look, guys, keep your money. I, I think, uh, I, I think I\xe2\x80\x99m done.\nSheldon: What, well what\xe2\x80\x99s wrong? Is she upsetting you? Because I can make her go away.\nArthur: No, she, she\xe2\x80\x99s the only reason I\xe2\x80\x99ve, I\xe2\x80\x99ve stayed this long.\nLeonard: Then what is it?\nArthur: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I think I\xe2\x80\x99m just, I, I just, I just don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be Professor Proton any more.\nSheldon: Well, how can you say that? Professor Proton\xe2\x80\x99s the best.\nArthur: What, what has it ever gotten me? I mean, I\xe2\x80\x99m, I\xe2\x80\x99m an 83-year-old man who has potatoes in, in his suitcase. Other scientists think, think I\xe2\x80\x99m a joke. And the, the puppeteer who did, who did Gino, well, he also did my wife.\nSheldon: Mr. Jeffries, I need to show you something. :14:11,446\nPenny: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry to hear about your troubles.\nArthur: Uh, thanks.\nPenny: But if you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind me asking, uh, the potato clock, how does it work? Is it a trick clock or a trick potato?\nArthur: What do you two talk about?\nSheldon: I wrote a fan letter to you when I was a child in Texas, and you sent this autographed picture back to me. Do you remember that?\nArthur: I\xe2\x80\x99ll, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you a hint. I have a bracelet with my own address on it.\nSheldon: Well, anyway, um, you may find this hard to believe, but I didn\xe2\x80\x99t have any friends growing up.\nArthur: No, I, I get that.\nSheldon: But, um, I did have you. And every day at four o\xe2\x80\x99clock, you\xe2\x80\x99d come to my house on Channel 68, and we\xe2\x80\x99d do science together. If it hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been for you, well, who knows what would\xe2\x80\x99ve become of me? You know? Instead of a world-class physicist, I could\xe2\x80\x99ve wound up as a hobo. Or a surgeon.\nLeonard: I bet there are important discoveries being made every day because you inspired millions of kids to pursue science. In a way, their discoveries are your discoveries.\nSheldon: Yeah, it\xe2\x80\x99s true. A generation of young scientists are standing on your shoulders.\nArthur: Well, thank, thank you, guys. That, that, that means a lot.\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s important you know how much you mean to us.\nArthur: Uh-oh.\nPenny: Arthur, are you okay?\nArthur: I\xe2\x80\x99m having a problem with my pacemaker.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99ll, I\xe2\x80\x99ll call for help.\nPenny: Any chance we could plug it into the potato?\nArthur: No.\nScene: The telescope lab. Raj\xe2\x80\x99s phone rings.\nRaj: Hello? What do you mean, you found my dog? She\xe2\x80\x99s with my friends. Is she okay? Oh, thank you. Uh, just text me your address, I\xe2\x80\x99m on my way. Oh, and if she\xe2\x80\x99s hungry, go ahead and feed her. But do not give her anything starchy. She\xe2\x80\x99s having risotto for dinner.\nScene: The apartment.\nParamedic: Your vitals are stable, but let\xe2\x80\x99s take you in for some tests just to be safe.\nLeonard: You want one of us to go with you in the ambulance?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99ll do it.\nArthur: He\xe2\x80\x99s not a relative, he\xe2\x80\x99s not allowed, right?\nParamedic: No, that\xe2\x80\x99s not a rule. He can go.\nSheldon: Oh, yeah.\nArthur: I can\xe2\x80\x99t catch a break today.\nPenny: We\xe2\x80\x99ll pack up your stuff and meet you at the hospital.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry things turned out this way.\nArthur: Well, at, at this point, I\xe2\x80\x99m just glad someone\xe2\x80\x99s carrying me down the stairs.\nSheldon: Met my childhood hero, now I get to ride in an ambulance. Boy, if we can get him to do that calendar, this\xe2\x80\x99ll be the best day ever.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nBernadette: Can\xe2\x80\x99t believe we lost her. What was I thinking? I\xe2\x80\x99d be a terrible mom.\nHoward: Well, maybe with the first one. But kids are like pancakes. The first one\xe2\x80\x99s always a throwaway. How\xe2\x80\x99s this look?\nBernadette: It\xe2\x80\x99s fine. Where\xe2\x80\x99d you get that picture of her?\nHoward: It\xe2\x80\x99s not her. I just googled foo-foo little dogs. (Skype tone) It\xe2\x80\x99s Raj. Stay quiet. Hey, bad timing. Bernadette just took Cinnamon out for a walk.\nRaj: Hmm. Interesting. Did they take a walk down Liars\xe2\x80\x99 Lane?\nHoward: What?\nRaj: A lane frequented by liars. Like you, you big liar.\nHoward: You have her?\nBernadette: Oh, thank God she\xe2\x80\x99s okay.\nRaj: Well, I trusted you, and you let me down. The poor thing\xe2\x80\x99s been shaking for hours.\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m really sorry.\nBernadette: Hang on, you\xe2\x80\x99ve had her for hours?\nRaj: Yes. I picked her up, and then we both went for massages to try and calm down. And then we got Pinkberry.\nBernadette: So you knew she was okay, and you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t pick up the phone to tell us?\nRaj: Well, I, I thought about\xe2\x80\xa6\nBernadette: Don\xe2\x80\x99t well me, mister. We\xe2\x80\x99ve been worried sick. She could have been dead for all we knew. You should be ashamed of yourself.\nRaj: Sorry. I, I just\xe2\x80\xa6\nBernadette: Sorry\xe2\x80\x99s not good enough. Maybe you need to take some time and think about what you\xe2\x80\x99ve done.\nHoward: Nice guilt trip. You are gonna be an amazing mom.\nScene: A hospital room.\nSheldon: Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur. Happy kitty, sleepy kitty, purr, purr, purr.\nArthur: Thank you, Sheldon. That, that was very nice.\nSheldon: Want me to sing it again?\nArthur: No. The fourth, the fourth time was, was the charm.\nSheldon: There anything I can get for you? Some apple juice? Uh, some Jell-O?\nArthur: No. No, thank you. But I, I do, I do have a favour to, to ask.\nSheldon: Name it.\nArthur: Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m, I\xe2\x80\x99m booked to do a children\xe2\x80\x99s party tomorrow, and, um, frankly I, you know, I, I don\xe2\x80\x99t feel up to it.\nSheldon: Oh, you\xe2\x80\x99re not. You look awful.\nArthur: Thank you. Anyway, uh, I mean, you know my act better than anybody. I was, I was hoping that maybe, you know, maybe you\xe2\x80\x99d fill in for me.\nSheldon: Are you saying that you want me to be Professor Proton?\nArthur: Yeah.\nSheldon: Oh, my. What an honour. Oh, this is like being asked to ascend Mount Olympus and dine with the gods.\nArthur: Or a Korean family in Alhambra.\nSheldon: But they\xe2\x80\x99ll know I\xe2\x80\x99m not you. Should I call myself Professor Proton, Jr.?\nArthur: Sounds great.\nSheldon: So, in a way it\xe2\x80\x99s like I\xe2\x80\x99m your son.\nArthur: What, Whatever.\nSheldon: Father.\nArthur: Sure, what the hell.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
