b'Scene: Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s lab.\nSheldon: Leonard, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got terrible news.\nLeonard: What\xe2\x80\x99s going on?\nSheldon: Before I tell you, perhaps I should soften the blow. You\xe2\x80\x99re face is pleasingly symmetrical.\nLeonard: Just tell me.\nSheldon: A Swedish team of physicists is trying to scoop our super-fluid vortex experiment.\nLeonard: Oh, well, that kind of stinks.\nSheldon: That kind of stinks? Why aren\xe2\x80\x99t you more upset? Did I soften the blow too much? Because this here is more like a Picasso painting.\nLeonard: What are we going to do?\nSheldon: Perform the experiment immediately.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99d love to, but we need liquid helium and our shipment\xe2\x80\x99s on back order for a month.\nSheldon: A month? What? Are you kidding me? That would have been a good time for you to soften the blow.\nLeonard: That shirt brings out the blue in your eyes.\nSheldon: Thank you. Aren\xe2\x80\x99t you sweet.\nLeonard: Let\xe2\x80\x99s go check to see if the university has any helium in reserve.\nSheldon: Did you know that I almost didn\xe2\x80\x99t wear this shirt today?\nScene: Barry Kripke\xe2\x80\x99s office.\nLeonard: Hey, Barry, we\xe2\x80\x99re in trouble. We need liquid helium, does the department have any we can use?\nBarry: Sowwy, there\xe2\x80\x99s a showtage. And what we do have I need for my quantum excitation study.\nSheldon: But you won\xe2\x80\x99t need much for that.\nBarry: Twue, but if it\xe2\x80\x99s successful, I\xe2\x80\x99m having a pawty with bawwoons.\nLeonard: Come on, Barry, there\xe2\x80\x99s a Swedish team trying to run our experiment before us. Can\xe2\x80\x99t you spare any?\nBarry: Be honest, if the shoe was on the other foot, would you do this for me?\nLeonard: Yes.\nSheldon: Not a chance.\nLeonard: What are you doing?\nSheldon: He said be honest, so I was honest. Didn\xe2\x80\x99t your mother tell you? It\xe2\x80\x99s the best policy. So, what do you say?\nBarry: Hell no.\nSheldon: He could\xe2\x80\x99ve softened the blow.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s lab.\nRaj: Why do you need Kripke? Can\xe2\x80\x99t you just go to Party City for helium?\nLeonard: We\xe2\x80\x99d have to go to every Party City in California.\nHoward: Sounds like you on Cinco de Mayo.\nRaj: Hey, people were still talking about that party on siete de Mayo.\nSheldon: Leonard, if that Swedish team beats us, I will never be able to enjoy anything from their country again. Which is a shame, because Swedish meatballs are my favourite toothpick-delivered meatball.\nHoward: If you need liquid helium so bad, I know a guy who can get you some, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t ask too many questions.\nLeonard: Who is he?\nSheldon: Where does he work?\nLeonard: How does he get the helium?\nSheldon: How many questions are too many questions?\nHoward: Maybe he\xe2\x80\x99s not for you.\nSheldon: Four questions. There answer\xe2\x80\x99s four.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s house.\nBernadette: Hey, you know who went out on a date the other night? Stuart.\nPenny: Oh, good for him.\nBernadette: I thought so, too.\nPenny: So is she, like, homeless, or framing him for a crime?\nBernadette: He\xe2\x80\x99s using some kind of dating app on his phone.\nPenny: Oh, which one? Maybe we can get Amy to try it.\nBernadette: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Stuart, can you come in here? He tried to explain it to me. It shows you pictures of people nearby, you swipe them around, it looks kind of like a game.\nPenny: Oh, and if you lose the game, you have to go out with Stuart.\nStuart: What\xe2\x80\x99s up?\nBernadette: Can you show us that dating app?\nStuart: Oh, yeah, sure. This thing has changed my life.\nPenny: Wow. So how many girls have you met?\nStuart: Two. I probably don\xe2\x80\x99t need to mention there\xe2\x80\x99s an entire number between that and zero.\nPenny: Well, so how does it work?\nStuart: Uh, well, it, it shows me all the single women in a five-mile radius who are using the app. If I like the way they look I hit thumbs up, if I don\xe2\x80\x99t, thumbs down.\nBernadette: Oh, what would make you give a girl a thumbs down?\nStuart: First time it happens I will let you know.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: Oh, hey. I just heard back from the liquid helium guy.\nSheldon: What\xe2\x80\x99s he say?\nLeonard: He\xe2\x80\x99s got what we need and can meet us tonight.\nSheldon: Really? You know I don\xe2\x80\x99t like buying things at night. January 7th, 2009, I went to the Ralph\xe2\x80\x99s at 11:30pm to pick up Cracklin\xe2\x80\x99 Oat Bran for the morning and what did I see?\nLeonard: The man restocking the cereal shelves.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s right. And what did he do?\nLeonard: He handed you the box directly and called you Stretch.\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s like it was yesterday.\nLeonard: Do you want liquid helium or not?\nSheldon: Of course I do. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want that Swedish team scooping us.\nLeonard: Then I\xe2\x80\x99m going to tell him we\xe2\x80\x99re in.\nSheldon: Leonard, wait. This is highly unethical.\nLeonard: We\xe2\x80\x99re just bending the rules a little. We have grant money to do the experiment, so we\xe2\x80\x99re going to spend it on the helium we need. It\xe2\x80\x99s not like when Dr. Goldfarb claimed he bought an electron microscope and he was really just keeping a Russian girl in an apartment in Van Nuys.\nSheldon: Was she helping him with his research?\nLeonard: Sure. So, are we doing this?\nSheldon: Well, but where does he get the helium?\nLeonard: Remember? Don\xe2\x80\x99t ask too many questions?\nSheldon: Uh, but this is violating university code.\nLeonard: A little, but if I may quote Einstein, the pursuit of science calls us to ignore the rules set by man.\nSheldon: Huh. All right, do it. Tell him we\xe2\x80\x99re in.\nLeonard: Done.\nSheldon: I can\xe2\x80\x99t find that quote on the Internet. Did you make that up?\nLeonard: Before I answer, may I just say your skin has never looked better.\nSheldon: Aren\xe2\x80\x99t you just made of sugar.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s house.\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure how I feel about this.\nPenny: Oh, come on, just let him put the app on your phone.\nBernadette: Yeah, Stuart got two dates with it.\nStuart: One of which would\xe2\x80\x99ve ended in sex had she not said no. Okay, all set.\nPenny: Okay, let me see. Nope, nope, nope, oh, he\xe2\x80\x99s cute.\nBernadette: Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t a teardrop tattoo mean he murdered someone?\nPenny: And he\xe2\x80\x99s sad about it.\nHoward: Hey.\nRaj: Hello.\nPenny: Hey.\nBernadette: Hey, I thought you were gonna be out late?\nHoward: If you wanted me to stay out later, you should\xe2\x80\x99ve given me more spending money.\nRaj: What are you guys up to?\nBernadette: We put Amy on a dating app, and we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing what\xe2\x80\x99s out there.\nRaj: Oh, fun. Let me see. Uh, no, no, uh, definitely not.\nHoward: What was wrong with that guy?\nRaj: Uh, he\xe2\x80\x99s Indian. We\xe2\x80\x99ve already got one of those. Ooh, we should find a nice Latino, really round us out.\nHoward: Hey, I want to try.\nAmy: Uh, excuse me, can I have my phone back?\nHoward: Hang on, I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to find you the next great love of your life. The man who will father your children. Okay, yes or no on white guy with dreadlocks?\nScene: A parking garage.\nLeonard: That must be him.\nSheldon: Oh, of course. An nondescript, white panel van. You may be familiar with it from the sentence, their bodies were found in a nondescript, white panel van.\nLeonard: Hey.\nMan: What\xe2\x80\x99s up?\nLeonard: Uh, I\xe2\x80\x99m Leonard. This is my friend\xe2\x80\xa6\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m Skippy. Skippy Cavanaugh.\nMan: Great. You got the cash?\nLeonard: Uh, yeah, uh, right here.\nSheldon: Wait, hold on, hold on. How do we know that you\xe2\x80\x99re not gonna take the money and drive away?\nLeonard: What ya doing, Skippy?\nSheldon: Exactly what 1970s television crime dramas have taught us. You give us the helium first.\nMan: Oh, how do I know you\xe2\x80\x99re not gonna drive away without paying me?\nSheldon: Guess I\xe2\x80\x99m not the only one who watches \xe2\x80\x9970s television crime dramas.\nLeonard: Look, you can trust us. We\xe2\x80\x99re respected scientists.\nSheldon: Well, he is. I\xe2\x80\x99m a wedding planner who can\xe2\x80\x99t find love himself. It\xe2\x80\x99s ironic, but the point is we can\xe2\x80\x99t trust you. You\xe2\x80\x99re a sketchy character in a parking garage.\nMan: Yeah, well, from my perspective, that\xe2\x80\x99s how you two appear to me.\nSheldon: Well, I never thought of it like that. Boy, frame of reference will just sneak up on you, won\xe2\x80\x99t it?\nLeonard: My friend does make a decent point about the money. I don\xe2\x80\x99t feel comfortable just handing it over up front.\nMan: Ah, no money, no helium. Seems we\xe2\x80\x99re at a, uh, stalemate.\nSheldon: Not technically. In chess, a stalemate refers to a situation in which there are no remaining moves. Uh, you have plenty of moves available. You could beat us up and steal the money. You could kill us, you know. Really, you\xe2\x80\x99re only limited by your imagination.\nMan: Huh. All these years I\xe2\x80\x99ve been using stalemate, when I really mean impasse. I feel foolish.\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it matters if this is a stalemate or an impasse or a Mexican standoff. What are we gonna do here?\nMan: Oh, whoa, whoa, how can it bea Mexican standoff? Everybody knows you need three sides for that.\nSheldon: Not necessarily. Uh, many argue the essence of a Mexican standoff is that no one can walk away from the conflict without incurring harm.\nMan: Hmm, I don\xe2\x80\x99t follow.\nSheldon: Let me give you an example. Earlier today, I decoded the headers on your e-mail, and I know that your name is Kenneth Fitzgerald. From that, I figured out where you live and where you work. Now, to make this a Mexican standoff, I would say something like, uh, you give us the helium or I\xe2\x80\x99ll turn you in to the authorities.\nMan: Is that a threat?\nSheldon: Yeah, exactly. See, you\xe2\x80\x99re getting it.\nMan: Yeah, well, I know where you work, all right? And if you mess with me, I\xe2\x80\x99ll report you, then I\xe2\x80\x99ll pound your asses into the ground.\nSheldon: Perfect. Now we really are in a Mexican standoff. Is this one of those times where I\xe2\x80\x99ve won the battle but lost the war?\nLeonard: Afraid so, Skippy.\nSheldon: I told you we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go shopping at night.\nLeonard: All right, let\xe2\x80\x99s all just calm down. Nobody wants to report anybody.\nMan: No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t like this. I\xe2\x80\x99m out.\nLeonard: No, no, no. Wait, don\xe2\x80\x99t go. Just let me explain. We\xe2\x80\x99re physicists, and we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to prove a hypothesis that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been working on for over a year.\nMan: Really? What\xe2\x80\x99s the hypothesis?\nSheldon: Space-time can be interpreted as the surface of an n-dimensional superfluid.\nMan: Hmm. Could be, could be. Go on.\nLeonard: Okay, but now there\xe2\x80\x99s this Swedish team that read our paper and they\xe2\x80\x99re trying to beat us to our own discovery. We really need this helium.\nSheldon: And I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry I lied about being a wedding planner who can\xe2\x80\x99t find love. Although I am currently single, if you know anybody.\nLeonard: Here\xe2\x80\x99s the money. Can we do this?\nMan: Okay. It\xe2\x80\x99s a shame about those scientists ripping you off. I expected a higher ethical standard from our friends in Sweden.\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s actually pretty common in our field. There\xe2\x80\x99s not much you can do about it.\nMan: Well, for the right amount of money, if you know where they live, there\xe2\x80\x99s, uh, plenty we could do about it.\nSheldon: Did you hear that, Leonard? There\xe2\x80\x99s plenty we could do about it. Do you have a card?\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s house.\nPenny: Okay, here we go. Now everyone can see. All right. Where do we stand on cross-eyed Mike?\nRaj: You know he won\xe2\x80\x99t be looking at other girls.\nHoward: Unless they\xe2\x80\x99re sitting on the end of his nose.\nPenny: Okay, okay, okay. Thumbs down. Next.\nBernadette: Ew, check out his tiny teeth. He looks like a man-dolphin.\nPenny: Well if he\xe2\x80\x99s good in bed, she can throw him a fish.\nHoward: I love you, Amy. (Dolphin noises)\nAmy: Okay, I\xe2\x80\x99m starting to feel guilty. Aren\xe2\x80\x99t we being a little mean?\nRaj: That\xe2\x80\x99s a fair point. We wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t make fun of someone like this to their face.\nPenny: Look, it\xe2\x80\x99s Stuart.\nRaj: You may want to leave the room.\nScene: Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s lab.\nSheldon: Right this way, Uncle Harvey.\nLeonard: Will you stop with that already?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m trying not to attract attention.\nLeonard: And tipping his hat to the cleaning lady didn\xe2\x80\x99t do that?\nSheldon: She said buenas noches. What was he supposed to do?\nLeonard: Let\xe2\x80\x99s just start the experiment.\nSheldon: Leonard, we should probably have our story straight in case we get caught.\nLeonard: We\xe2\x80\x99re not getting caught.\nSheldon: Well, you can\xe2\x80\x99t be sure of that. What if the helium dealer rats us out? What if Kripke asks where we got it? What if the university checks my family tree and finds out I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an Uncle Harvey?\nLeonard: The dealer doesn\xe2\x80\x99t care, Kripke has no authority over us, and you being related to a metal container would explain a lot. Help me hook this up.\nSheldon: Uh-oh.\nLeonard: What?\nSheldon: Well, did you see this sticker?\nLeonard: What is it?\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s partially torn off, but the segment that remains reads property of and the letter U.\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s probably USC or UCLA.\nSheldon: Yeah, but what if it\xe2\x80\x99s Property of U.S. Government? There\xe2\x80\x99s a national helium reserve in Amarillo, Texas. If this was stolen from there, we\xe2\x80\x99re accessories to a federal crime.\nLeonard: Let\xe2\x80\x99s not jump to conclusions. A lot of things start with U.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s true. There\xe2\x80\x99s the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Department of Defence, U.S. Navy, you and I are going to jail.\nLeonard: Listen, we can do the experiment as planned and beat the Swedish team to the punch, or we can kiss our dreams good-bye because we were to afraid to break a few rules.\nScene: A university corridor.\nLeonard: Ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s house.\nPenny: Okay, does everyone remember the rules? If he\xe2\x80\x99s shirtless, one sip. Posing with a pet, two sips. Pet and shirtless, chug like it\xe2\x80\x99s your job. And pull.\nRaj: I have that same underwear.\nPenny: Chug.\nPenny: Amy, you\xe2\x80\x99re getting a text.\nAmy: Oh, um, give me that.\nRaj: I had a great time last night.\nAmy: No, no, stop reading that.\nHoward: Who\xe2\x80\x99s Dave?\nPenny: You went on a date last night? Are you seeing someone?\nAmy: No, it, it\xe2\x80\x99s not like that.\nBernadette: And I\xe2\x80\x99d love to take you out again\xe2\x80\x9d?\nAll: Amy/What?/Can\xe2\x80\x99t believe it/Oh, my God.\nAmy: Okay, it\xe2\x80\x99s like that.\nScene: The parking garage.\nLeonard: Thank you for coming back.\nMan: Yeah, well, normally I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t, but my daughter\xe2\x80\x99s having a sleepover, and there\xe2\x80\x99s only so much screaming and Katy Perry a man can take.\nSheldon: Anyway, if you could just give us our money back, you can have your helium and we\xe2\x80\x99ll be on our way.\nMan: Yeah, well, is there something wrong with it?\nLeonard: No, nothing. We just changed our mind.\nSheldon: He has glasses and I\xe2\x80\x99m a know-it-all, we are not built for prison.\nMan: Yeah, I hear you. Well, you\xe2\x80\x99re good guys, so I\xe2\x80\x99ll, uh, I\xe2\x80\x99ll take the helium off your hands.\nLeonard: Thank you.\nMan: But you ain\xe2\x80\x99t getting your money back.\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re taking advantage of us? We clarified nomenclature together.\nMan: Look, I enjoy semantic digressions as much as the next guy, but, uh, this is business.\nLeonard: You know what? It\xe2\x80\x99s fine. Keep the money. We just want to be done with this.\nMan: No problem, but I am gonna have to charge you a small helium restocking fee.\nSheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand.\nLeonard: He wants more money.\nSheldon: Well, it better not be more than a thousand dollars. That\xe2\x80\x99s all I\xe2\x80\x99ve got on me.\nMan: That\xe2\x80\x99s exactly how much it is.\nSheldon: Finally, something breaks our way.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s house.\nPenny: I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe you\xe2\x80\x99re seeing someone and we don\xe2\x80\x99t even know about it.\nBernadette: Yeah, why wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you tell us?\nAmy: Because it\xe2\x80\x99s new and weird and I\xe2\x80\x99m just trying to figure it all out. And I knew if I told you guys I had been out with a few people that you\xe2\x80\x99d get way too excited about it.\nStuart: A few people?\nBernadette: What?\nPenny: Amy.\nStuart: So, are we allowed to ask how it\xe2\x80\x99s going?\nAmy: It\xe2\x80\x99s going fine. It\xe2\x80\x99s mostly just been meeting people for coffee.\nRaj: What? I thought we were all\xe2\x80\xa6 never mind.\nBernadette: I, I thought you weren\xe2\x80\x99t ready to start seeing people.\nAmy: Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have much experience dating, so I decided it would be good for me to, you know, get out there a little.\nPenny: Well, good for you.\nAmy: Thank you.\nBernadette: And how many guys have you gone out with?\nStuart: Please be less than two.\nAmy: Three.\nStuart: Damn it.\nScene: Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s lab.\nSheldon: Well, the Swedes might beat us, but at least we won\xe2\x80\x99t get gang-noogied in prison.\nLeonard: Is Ernest Goes to Jail the only prison movie you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen?\nSheldon: It scared me straight, Leonard.\nBarry: Hey, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been thinking. I was being petty. You can have my hewium.\nLeonard: Thank you, Barry.\nBarry: But you have to add my name to your paper.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s preposterous.\nBarry: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, seems fair. You can\xe2\x80\x99t do it without me.\nLeonard: Can you give us a minute?\nBarry: Take your time. I\xe2\x80\x99ll walk out backwards for dwamatic effect.\nSheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t like being extorted like this. Especially by him of all people.\nLeonard: Me neither, but what other choice do we have?\nScene: The parking garage.\nLeonard: I promise this is the last time.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: It says right here on Wikipedia. A Mexican standoff is a confrontation between at least three parties.\nSheldon: How can you trust Wikipedia if they use between to refer to three parties?\nHelium Man: They should\xe2\x80\x99ve used among, right?\nSheldon: Or amongst, if they were feeling whimsically archaic.\nHelium Man: All right, enough with the chitchat. Are we gonna watch Ernest Goes to Jail or not?\nSheldon: Absolutely. But don\xe2\x80\x99t be surprised if this movie sets you on the straight and narrow.\nHelium Man: I am open to change.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
