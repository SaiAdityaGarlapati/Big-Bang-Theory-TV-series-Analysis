b'Scene: The cafeteria.\nRaj: So, anyway, last night on video chat, I spent, like, twenty minutes just staring into Lucy\xe2\x80\x99s eyes.\nLeonard: Oh, that sounds romantic.\nRaj: It was until I realized the screen had frozen. Still one of my top three dates of all time.\nLeonard: So, are we ever gonna hang out with this girl?\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99d love that, but she\xe2\x80\x99s not really comfortable around people.\nSheldon: Yeah, I used to be uncomfortable around people, but then I learned a trick. I pretend everyone I meet is a beloved character from Star Trek.\nLeonard: How\xe2\x80\x99s that been working for you?\nSheldon: Oh, like a charm, unnamed crewman in a red shirt.\nHoward: Leonard, I may have gotten you a job.\nLeonard: I have a job.\nSheldon: Yes, he does. He caters to my every whim.\nHoward: No, in a couple of weeks, Stephen Hawking\xe2\x80\x99s team is sending an expedition to the North Sea to test hydrodynamic simulations of black holes. One of their experimental physicists dropped out, and I recommended you.\nLeonard: Well, do you really think I have a shot?\nHoward: Yeah, I\xe2\x80\x99ve worked with Hawking. I talked you up. He knows your research. I think this could happen.\nLeonard: He knows, wow.\nSheldon: Well, now, but do you think that\xe2\x80\x99s a good idea? Uh, you know Star Trek. Should a guy with no name and a red shirt really go on an expedition?\nRaj: Hey, don\xe2\x80\x99t discourage him. This is a fantastic opportunity.\nSheldon: No one asked you, Uhura.\nScene: Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s car.\nSheldon: Would you like to hear a classic Sheldon Cooper factoid?\nLeonard: What do you think?\nSheldon: Great. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been doing some reading about vehicular safety. Did you know that the highest number of drowning accidents happen on or around boats?\nLeonard: Interesting that you would bring that up when I might go work on a boat.\nSheldon: Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s the thing about factoids, they\xe2\x80\x99re interesting.\nLeonard: I know what you\xe2\x80\x99re doing. You don\xe2\x80\x99t want me going on this research trip because you\xe2\x80\x99re afraid to be alone.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m not afraid to be alone. On land. On the sea, it would be terrifying. Because of all the drowning.\nLeonard: Sheldon.\nSheldon: Fine, no more drowning talk. I\xe2\x80\x99ll change the subject. Oh. Who do you think would win in a fight, you or a shark?\nLeonard: Look, I appreciate your signature blend of concern for me and incredible selfishness. If I get the chance to do this, there is nothing you can say that\xe2\x80\x99s going to stop me.\nSheldon: Very well. Things between you and Penny have never been better. I hope four months apart doesn\xe2\x80\x99t change anything. I should have opened with that, huh?\nCredits sequence.\nScene: Raj\xe2\x80\x99s apartment. Lucy is looking through Raj\xe2\x80\x99s telescope.\nRaj: If you look carefully at Venus, you should be able to see the International Space Station pass by.\nLucy: Wow. Your friend was actually up there?\nRaj: Yeah. He brought me back a T-shirt that said My Friend Went to the Space Station and All I Got Was This Lousy T-Shirt\nLucy: Did he take the T-shirt to space?\nRaj: Nope. It\xe2\x80\x99s exactly as lousy as advertised. Speaking of friends, they have been asking to meet you. I was thinking maybe we could all hang out sometime?\nLucy: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. How many are there?\nRaj: Let\xe2\x80\x99s see. Six. That\xe2\x80\x99s pretty cool, I have six friends. Kind of like Sinatra.\nLucy: Six strangers? That\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of pressure. Staring at me, asking me personal questions. Like, what do you do? Where are you from? Why did you lock yourself in the bathroom?\nRaj: Okay, how about you just dip your toe in and meet one of them?\nLucy: Will you be there?\nRaj: Of course.\nLucy: Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s two. Three if you count me. Oh, this is getting out of hand.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nPenny: So, then, during my afternoon shift, I spilled an entire tray of drinks on myself.\nLeonard: Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s awful.\nPenny: Not really. My shirt was soaking wet. I got, like, the biggest tip of my life.\nLeonard: So, listen, do you remember when I said the similarities of the equations of general relativity and hydrodynamics suggest you could find the equivalent of Unruh radiation in a large body of water?\nPenny: I thought I said that to you.\nLeonard: Anyway, Stephen Hawking\xe2\x80\x99s team is looking into that, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve been invited to join them.\nPenny: Wow, Hawking. Good for you.\nLeonard: Well, it is. Just, you know, I\xe2\x80\x99d be gone for a while.\nPenny: Well, how long?\nLeonard: Three, four months.\nPenny: Whoa. When would you leave?\nLeonard: Couple of weeks.\nPenny: Wow. Oh, okay, well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll just come visit you.\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99s the thing, you can\xe2\x80\x99t. I\xe2\x80\x99ll be on a ship in the North Sea.\nPenny: On a ship? Aren\xe2\x80\x99t they afraid Hawking will just roll overboard?\nLeonard: Uh, he\xe2\x80\x99s not gonna be there. He\xe2\x80\x99s just sending a team to research his theory.\nPenny: Oh, sure. Like when you send me to kill spiders in your bathtub. Wow. Okay. Four months.\nLeonard: Yeah. And I\xe2\x80\x99m a little worried because things between us have been so great, and I\xe2\x80\x99d hate to do anything that screws that up.\nPenny: Oh, sweetie, if you\xe2\x80\x99re gonna screw things up, it\xe2\x80\x99s gonna be while you\xe2\x80\x99re here, not while you\xe2\x80\x99re away. No. I mean, look, you have to go. It sounds like an amazing opportunity. And I\xe2\x80\x99m just basing that on how much I didn\xe2\x80\x99t understand what you said about it.\nLeonard: Okay. I\xe2\x80\x99ll confirm the travel arrangements in the morning.\nPenny: Okay. Good.\nLeonard: I do have to ask you one favour.\nPenny: Sure.\nLeonard: Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s nervous about me leaving. Just keep an eye on him while I\xe2\x80\x99m gone.\nPenny: Oh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Remember what happened when I took care of your goldfish?\nLeonard: Well, flush Sheldon down the toilet and get me a new one.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: Really, you guys do not need to throw me a going-away party.\nHoward: Are you kidding me? How often can you say bon voyage to somebody when they\xe2\x80\x99re actually going on a voyage?\nAmy: Hello, Rajesh.\nHoward (in Raj accent): Hello, Amy. Nice to see you. What can I say? It\xe2\x80\x99s funnier with the accent.\nLeonard: There\xe2\x80\x99s beer in the fridge. Anyway, you guys really don\xe2\x80\x99t need to make a big deal.\nSheldon: Leonard, you\xe2\x80\x99re being selfish. We need to give you a proper send-off so we\xe2\x80\x99ll have closure when you die at sea and crabs eat your face.\nPenny: Sheldon, sweetie, shut up.\nBernadette: You know, one of the things that helped me get through Howard being in space for so long was getting married before he left.\nPenny: Bernadette, sweetie, shut up.\nRaj: Okay. I have a request to make.\nAmy: And now he can talk. I want to cut open your brain and see what the heck\xe2\x80\x99s going on in there.\nRaj: The only person allowed inside this head is Dr. Phil. Anyway, I, I spoke to my new lady friend about meeting you all, and she thought it would be easier for her to start with just one.\nSheldon: Oh, gee, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. My schedule\xe2\x80\x99s a little busy.\nRaj: Actually, I was thinking Leonard.\nLeonard: Oh. Thank you, Raj. I\xe2\x80\x99d be honoured.\nHoward: What the hell? I thought I was your best friend.\nRaj: You are, but you\xe2\x80\x99ve got kind of a big personality, with your flashy clothes and your Woody Allen swagger.\nPenny: You know, maybe she\xe2\x80\x99d be more comfortable meeting a girl first.\nRaj: Good idea. Bernadette?\nPenny: What the hell?\nRaj: Well, you\xe2\x80\x99re very pretty. That could be intimidating to another woman.\nPenny: Oh, yeah.\nBernadette: Hey, you don\xe2\x80\x99t think I\xe2\x80\x99m pretty enough to scare your girlfriend?\nHoward: Calm down, Bernie. You\xe2\x80\x99re very scary.\nAmy: It should be me.\nRaj: Why? So you can make jokes about cutting open my brain?\nAmy: A, that was not a joke, that was a sincere request. And B, more importantly, I was the outsider to this group, and I know how frightening that can be. But you guys took me in and made me feel loved, like I was family.\nSheldon: Fine, I\xe2\x80\x99ll do it.\nScene: Raj\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nAmy: So, after I started dating Sheldon, I met Leonard, and then everybody else, and they\xe2\x80\x99ve all been so wonderful to me.\nLucy: That\xe2\x80\x99s really nice to hear.\nAmy: Maybe next week, we could all get together.\nRaj: Oh, Lucy, you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to answer that. Don\xe2\x80\x99t put her on the spot. She hates that. Am I right? Tell her how much you hate being put on the spot. Go ahead, tell her.\nAmy: Ignore him. He\xe2\x80\x99s a little nervous \xe2\x80\x99cause he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t think I understand the severity of your social anxiety.\nRaj: What the? Are you crazy? You can\xe2\x80\x99t talk about social anxiety to someone who has social anxiety. It makes them socially anxious!\nAmy: Excuse me, but I\xe2\x80\x99m a neurobiologist. I think I\xe2\x80\x99m a little more qualified than you to understand what\xe2\x80\x99s not working in your girlfriend\xe2\x80\x99s brain!\nRaj: Don\xe2\x80\x99t call her my girlfriend. We haven\xe2\x80\x99t discussed whether or not we\xe2\x80\x99re girlfriend or boyfriend yet. Now that it\xe2\x80\x99s out there, are you my girlfriend? By the way, if you say no, I\xe2\x80\x99ll never be happy again. Not to put you on the spot.\nLucy: I think I have to go to the bathroom.\nRaj: We might as well go ahead and eat. She\xe2\x80\x99s not coming back anytime soon.\nScene: A store.\nSheldon: This is ridiculous, we\xe2\x80\x99re shopping for a party and this store doesn\xe2\x80\x99t even have a party section.\nPenny: Yeah, it does, and here we are.\nSheldon: You know, I have to say, Penny, I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand why you of all people are encouraging Leonard to do this.\nPenny: Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m his girlfriend, of course I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna support him.\nSheldon: Yeah, well, you\xe2\x80\x99re his girlfriend for now. You know, maybe you\xe2\x80\x99re not aware of this, but there is a rich tradition of men at sea finding comfort in each other\xe2\x80\x99s arms and britches.\nPenny: Honey, this is a big deal for Leonard, okay? He gets to work with Stephen Hawking. Who, by the way, will not be on the boat. I checked it out.\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s not that big of an opportunity. And even if Hawking\xe2\x80\x99s theories are correct, all they prove is where the universe came from, why everything exists and what its ultimate end will be. I mean, me? I\xe2\x80\x99m interested in the big questions.\nPenny: Oh, my God, Sheldon the genius is jealous of Leonard.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m not jealous. I\xe2\x80\x99m just very unhappy that good things are happening for him and not happening for me.\nPenny: Look, sweetie, this is a natural thing to feel, okay? But just because good things are happening to Leonard doesn\xe2\x80\x99t take anything away from you. You know what? Let me tell you a little story. Once there was a girl who worked at the Cheesecake Factory, and she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t very good at her job.\nSheldon: It was you.\nPenny: It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t me. But she was also an actress, and we were both up for the same part in a toothpaste commercial. She got it. Look, I was so jealous. But instead of ripping out her fake blonde hair\xe2\x80\xa6\nSheldon: You ripped out your own fake blonde hair.\nPenny: I, looked her in the eye, smiled and said, I\xe2\x80\x99m happy for you. Because that\xe2\x80\x99s what friends do.\nSheldon: They lie so they don\xe2\x80\x99t look petty.\nPenny: Yeah.\nSheldon: How?\nPenny: Like this. I am so happy for you.\nSheldon: Wow. No wonder you didn\xe2\x80\x99t get that toothpaste commercial.\nScene: Raj\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nRaj (on skype): Hey.\nLucy: Hi.\nRaj: I want to apologize for Amy last night. She was completely out of line. Are you, are you not speaking to me or did the screen freeze again?\nLucy: Amy wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the problem.\nRaj: Okay. I know. It was me. I, I pushed too hard. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.\nLucy: Thank you.\nRaj: You know, I, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been thinking that maybe meeting somebody one-on-one is too intense, so Friday night, my friends are having a party.\nLucy: A party?\nRaj: A little one. It\xe2\x80\x99s, it\xe2\x80\x99s a farewell for Leonard, so all the attention will be on him. If you wear something brown and sit on the couch, they won\xe2\x80\x99t even know you\xe2\x80\x99re there.\nLucy: I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure.\nRaj: Oh, please?\nLucy: Raj.\nRaj: Come on. Don\xe2\x80\x99t make me beg. And I\xe2\x80\x99m from India, so I know how to do it.\nLucy: Okay.\nRaj: Yeah, thank you! This means a lot to me. My friends are like my family. Unless you don\xe2\x80\x99t like them, in which case, they\xe2\x80\x99re dead to me.\nScene: The apartment.\nBernadette: So, have you ever spent a long time on a boat before?\nLeonard: Yeah.\nBernadette: Are you referring to the time we got stuck on the Small World ride at Disneyland?\nLeonard: Yeah.\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m proud of you, Leonard. Working out on the North Sea for months, that\xe2\x80\x99s really something.\nLeonard: I know. As far as science goes, this is the adventure of a lifetime.\nHoward: Maybe your lifetime. I went to space.\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s not a competition.\nHoward: You\xe2\x80\x99re right, you\xe2\x80\x99re right. I\xe2\x80\x99m really proud of you, and I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna miss you when you\xe2\x80\x99re gone. And space beats water.\nAmy: Rajesh, I thought Lucy was coming.\nRaj: She is. She\xe2\x80\x99s just running a little late. You know how it is, girls always fussing about their hair, their makeup. She\xe2\x80\x99ll be here. Just give it a rest, okay?\nSheldon: Um, can I have your attention, everyone? (Clinks glass) That\xe2\x80\x99s, uh, B-flat, for those who don\xe2\x80\x99t have perfect pitch. I would like to propose a toast to my best friend, Dr. Leonard Hofstadter. He has been presented with a wonderful opportunity, and I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be happier for him.\nLeonard: Thank you, Sheldon. That must\xe2\x80\x99ve been very hard for you to say.\nSheldon: Well, I mean it. I\xe2\x80\x99m really happy for you. And that\xe2\x80\x99s how you get a toothpaste commercial. Cheers.\nHoward: Cheers.\nPenny: Cheers.\nHoward: It was really nice of you to try to be happy for Leonard.\nSheldon: Thank you.\nHoward: It must\xe2\x80\x99ve killed you when I went to space.\nRaj (Looking at phone): Oh, no.\nHoward: Buddy, you okay? Oh, man.\nBernadette: What\xe2\x80\x99s going on?\nRaj: Uh, go ahead. Read it.\nHoward: Raj, I can\xe2\x80\x99t come to the party. This is all just too much for me. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think we should see each other any more. Sorry. Lucy.\nRaj: Excuse me.\nPenny: Raj, I\xe2\x80\x99m so sorry.\nAmy: Me, too.\nSheldon: It did not kill me when you went to space. Monkeys went to space.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s car, outside the Airport.\nPenny: Well, here we are.\nLeonard: Yep. I\xe2\x80\x99m really gonna miss you.\nPenny: I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna miss you, too.\nSheldon: Penny, we\xe2\x80\x99re in the red zone. The white zone is for loading and unloading. We\xe2\x80\x99re breaking the law.\nPenny: Okay, there\xe2\x80\x99s no space in the white zone, so\xe2\x80\xa6\nLeonard: Anyway, we can e-mail, and I think the phone connections are pretty good.\nSheldon: All right, you have to get out of the car right now. I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to jail for you.\nLeonard: Would you just relax?\nSheldon: Oh, I see a space in the white zone. Quick, circle the airport.\nPenny: Did you bring enough inhalers?\nLeonard: Yeah.\nPenny: And, uh, extra Dramamine? You remember what happened on It\xe2\x80\x99s a Small World.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m covered.\nPenny: Okay.\nSheldon: Oh, dear Lord, a police officer\xe2\x80\x99s glancing in our direction. We\xe2\x80\x99ve been made.\nLeonard: Calm down. I\xe2\x80\x99m getting out. I have something I want to give you.\nPenny: Oh, Leonard.\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s just a heart-shaped locket with a picture of Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s face in it. He got it at the mall on clearance. Now move, move, move.\nPenny: I love you.\nLeonard: I love you, too.\nSheldon: Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry, Officer. They just love each other. We\xe2\x80\x99re not smuggling drugs.\nScene: Raj\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nPenny: Raj, it\xe2\x80\x99s Penny. Are you in there?\nRaj: Hang on.\nPenny: Hey. I\xe2\x80\x99m just coming back from the airport. I wanted to see how you\xe2\x80\x99re doing.\nRaj: That\xe2\x80\x99s, that\xe2\x80\x99s very nice of you. Uh, come, come. Come on in.\nPenny: Can\xe2\x80\x99t stay long. I left Sheldon in the car with the window cracked open. He\xe2\x80\x99s gonna go through that activity book in, like, 30 seconds, so\xe2\x80\xa6 Are you okay?\nRaj: No.\nPenny: Oh. I\xe2\x80\x99m so sorry.\nRaj: No. It\xe2\x80\x99s my fault. You know, I finally found someone who was right for me, and I, I drove her away.\nPenny: Oh, Raj.\nRaj: Penny, I, I miss her already.\nPenny: I know how you feel. I miss Leonard, too.\nRaj: What\xe2\x80\x99s like, what is wrong with me? Why, why can\xe2\x80\x99t I ever have love?\nPenny: You will.\nRaj: No, I, I won\xe2\x80\x99t. I\xe2\x80\x99m, I\xe2\x80\x99m unlovable.\nPenny: That\xe2\x80\x99s just the booze talking.\nRaj: No, it\xe2\x80\x99s not. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t had a drink since last night.\nPenny: You\xe2\x80\x99re talking to me.\nRaj: I am. And now I\xe2\x80\x99m crying for a whole different reason!\nPenny: Oh, me, too.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nRaj: So I guess what I\xe2\x80\x99m saying is I get where Lucy\xe2\x80\x99s coming from.\nPenny: That\xe2\x80\x99s great. Do you want some wine?\nRaj: Uh, no, water\xe2\x80\x99s fine. Anyhow, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been thinking about it a lot and, and I totally see why Lucy did what she did. I pushed too hard. But you know what? If I back off and give her enough space, maybe there\xe2\x80\x99s still a future for us. Yeah, the funny thing about life is that, you know, sometimes\xe2\x80\xa6\nAmy: Does he ever shut up?\nRaj: \xe2\x80\xa6 but then it turns good again, and that means it\xe2\x80\x99s better than if it had never been bad for a while. I know that now, thing\xe2\x80\x99s aren\xe2\x80\x99t good, they are in fact very very bad but at least my heart is starting to heal. Slowly but surely. And oh how I cried. It was like a little, uh, thunderstorm on my face. But I\xe2\x80\x99m a man, okay? So I need to pull myself together, pick up a pen and get it all out in my journal. I mean, it\xe2\x80\x99s not all bad, right? Having my heart broken has allowed me to finally speak in front of you, so, you know, a silver lining\xe2\x80\xa6.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
