b'Scene: The lobby.\nSheldon: Penny, hello.\nPenny: Hey, Sheldon.\nSheldon: What is shaking?\nPenny: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry?\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s colloquial, a conversation opener. So, do you find the weather satisfying? Are you currently sharing in the triumph of some local sports team?\nPenny: What\xe2\x80\x99s wrong with you? you\xe2\x80\x99re freaking me out.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m striking up a casual conversation with you. S\xe2\x80\x99u\xe2\x80\x99up?\nPenny: Please don\xe2\x80\x99t do that.\nSheldon: All right, But I\xe2\x80\x99m given to understand that when you have something awkward to discuss with someone, it\xe2\x80\x99s more palatable to preface it with banal chit chat.\nPenny: So, this wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the awkward part?\nSheldon: No.\nPenny: Oh, all right. S\xe2\x80\x99u\xe2\x80\x99up?\nSheldon: Oh, good, I used that right. Anyway, you\xe2\x80\x99re aware that Leonard has entered into a new romantic relationship which includes a sexual component?\nPenny: Okay, feeling the awkward now.\nSheldon: Her name is Dr. Stephanie Barnett and she is a highly distinguished surgical resident at Freemont Memorial.\nPenny: Yeah, Leonard told me.\nSheldon: Good. What he may have left out is how important this relationship is to me.\nPenny: To you?\nSheldon: Yes, see, of the handful of women Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s been involved with, she\xe2\x80\x99s the only one I have ever found tolerable.\nPenny: Well, what about me?\nSheldon: The statement stands for itself.\nPenny: Well, aren\xe2\x80\x99t you sweet?\nSheldon: Anyway, should you have any interaction with her, it would be most helpful that she not see you as a sexual rival.\nPenny: Yeah, I think she\xe2\x80\x99s pretty safe.\nSheldon: You say that now, but consider the following scenario, you\xe2\x80\x99re sitting in your apartment, it\xe2\x80\x99s late, you\xe2\x80\x99re alone, your hypothalamus is swimming in a soup of estrogen and progesterone and suddenly even Leonard seems like a viable sexual candidate, or a, uh, hookup as it\xe2\x80\x99s referred to by today\xe2\x80\x99s urban youth.\nPenny: Really?\nSheldon: Yes. Now, should that happen, I would ask you to find some way to suppress your libido.\nPenny: I could think about you.\nSheldon: Fine, whatever works.\nPenny: Always nice talking to you, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Uh, peace out!\nCredits sequence.\n  Scene: The apartment.\n  Sheldon: Well, this is very pleasant.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m glad you\xe2\x80\x99re enjoying yourself.\nSheldon: And you said there\xe2\x80\x99d never be enough pasta for the three of us.\nLeonard: I stand corrected.\nSheldon: You know, Italian housewives have a rule of thumb. A handful of dry pasta about an inch in diameter is sufficient for each person as it doubles in volume when cooked.\nSteph: That\xe2\x80\x99s very interesting.\nSheldon: Thank you.\nLeonard: She doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean it. She\xe2\x80\x99s just being nice.\nSheldon: Well, Stephanie, since Leonard seems to be dropping the conversational ball, I guess I\xe2\x80\x99ll just have to pick it up. Have you ever witnessed a violent crime?\nSteph: No.\nSheldon: Good. What\xe2\x80\x99s your favourite fruit?\nSteph: Ih-uh, strawberries.\nSheldon: Hmm, technically not a fruit, but all right. Where did you do your medical internship?\nSteph: Uh, Lawrence Memorial in Galveston, Texas.\nSheldon: Really? That\xe2\x80\x99s where I was born!\nSteph: You\xe2\x80\x99re kidding!\nSheldon: I spent so much of my childhood at that hospital. When I was 12, I got to ride there in a helicopter.\nSteph: Why, what-what-what happened?\nSheldon: Radiation burns. A little mishap while I was building my own cat scanner.\nSteph: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, you tried to build your own cat scanner?\nSheldon: No, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t try, I succeeded. In fact, I was briefly able to see the inside of my sister\xe2\x80\x99s guinea pig, Snowball, before he caught fire. It led to an interesting expression in our house, not a snowball\xe2\x80\x99s chance in a cat scanner.\nLeonard: Uh, Sheldon?\nSheldon: Excuse me. When I come back, just for fun, the subject will be alternative history. Specifically, how would the civil war have gone differently if Lincoln had been a robot sent from the future? (To Leonard) Look at that, there\xe2\x80\x99s even pasta left over.\nLeonard: Do you understand that this was supposed to be a date?\nSheldon: I do. Do you? Because frankly, you\xe2\x80\x99ve been in a foul mood since I sat down.\nLeonard: Okay, here\xe2\x80\x99s my question, why did you sit down?\nSheldon: To help. Look, if you fail at this relationship, and history suggests you will, then we risk losing the medical officer that our landing party has always needed.\nLeonard: What landing party?\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re Kirk, I\xe2\x80\x99m Spock, Wolowitz is Scotty, Koothrappali is the guy who always gets killed, and now we\xe2\x80\x99ve got McCoy.\nScene: A cinema.\nSteph: So, we\xe2\x80\x99re all standing around looking at the post-op x ray and there it is, clear as day, right in the guy\xe2\x80\x99s chest cavity, one of my earrings.\nLeonard: Oh, my god, what did you do?\nSteph: What do you think I did? I discreetly slipped off the other earring, put it in my pocket and then got the hell out of there!\nSheldon (arriving): I have a bone to pick with you, sir.\nLeonard: Oo-oo-oh!\nSteph: Hi, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Hi, Stephanie. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry I\xe2\x80\x99m late, but your companion left the most indecipherable invitation.\nLeonard: What invitation?\nSheldon: We\xe2\x80\x99re going to the movies. What movie? What theatre? What time? If you were trying to make it impossible to locate you, you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have done a better job.\nLeonard: Oh, clearly I could have.\nSheldon: It took me nearly 20 minutes to go through the browser history on your computer to see what movie times you looked up. Wait here, I\xe2\x80\x99ll find us seats.\nSteph: No, no, we have seats.\nLeonard: Not the right seats. (Sheldon moves around the theatre sitting in various seats and shouting \xe2\x80\x9cHa!\xe2\x80\x9d)\nSteph: What is he doing?\nLeonard: He\xe2\x80\x99s finding the acoustic sweet spot.\nSteph: Does he always do this?\nLeonard: Sometimes he brings a toy xylophone. I am really sorry about this.\nSteph: No, it\xe2\x80\x99s fine. you know, he\xe2\x80\x99s sweet.\nSheldon: My apologies, you\xe2\x80\x99ve been sitting in it all along. Leonard, you want to slide over one?\nLeonard: No, just sit here.\nSheldon: Oh, yeah, this is it.\nScene: Outside Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom.\nSheldon (Knock, knock, knock) : Leonard (knock, knock, knock) Leonard (knock, knock, knock) Leonard.\nLeonard: What, Sheldon? What, Sheldon? What, Sheldon?\nSheldon (showing him laptop): Tell me what you see here.\nLeonard: The blunt instrument that will be the focus of my murder trial?\nSheldon: This is Stephanie\xe2\x80\x99s facebook page. Now, where it should say in a relationship, what does it say?\nLeonard: Stephanie Barnett is single.\nSheldon: Yeah, furthermore, earlier this evening, she threw a digital sheep at some guy named Mike. Who\xe2\x80\x99s Mike? Why does he get a digital sheep and not you?\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s just her facebook page and we\xe2\x80\x99ve only been going out a couple of weeks.\nSheldon: You don\xe2\x80\x99t see it, do you? We\xe2\x80\x99re losing her.\nLeonard: Okay, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to make this very simple for you. You are not in this relationship, I am. Ergo, you have no say in anything that happens between me and Stephanie.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid I can\xe2\x80\x99t allow that. Pursuant to Starfleet General Order 104 Section A, you are deemed unfit and I hereby relieve you of your command.\nLeonard: General Order 104, Section A does not apply in this situation.\nSheldon: Give me one good reason why not.\nLeonard: Because this is not Star Trek\nScene: Outside Penny\xe2\x80\x99s door.\n  Sheldon (Knock, knock, knock) : Penny (knock, knock, knock) Penny (knock, knock, knock) Penny.\nPenny: What?\nSheldon: This is banana bread.\nPenny: This is a door knob.\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s my understanding that an unsolicited gift of food can be a precursor to an impromptu invitation to come in and chat.\nPenny: Sheldon, would you like to come in?\nSheldon: I suppose I could spare a few minutes. Were you robbed?\nPenny: No.\nSheldon: How can you be sure?\nPenny: Sheldon, what do you want?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m certain this will come as no surprise to you, but Leonard is failing in yet another relationship.\nPenny: He\xe2\x80\x99s having problems with Stephanie?\nSheldon: She\xe2\x80\x99s sending virtual livestock to random men on the internet. If I have any hope of keeping them together, I need data. Specifically, I need to know exactly what Leonard did that caused you to pop an emotional cap in his buttocks.\nPenny: What?\nSheldon: Again, urban slang. In which, I believe I\xe2\x80\x99m gaining remarkable fluency. So, what is the down and the low? And don\xe2\x80\x99t worry, this is all entirely confidential, so, you feel free to include any and all shortcomings in the bedroom.\nPenny: We never got to the bedroom.\nSheldon: Because?\nPenny: Oh, okay, all right, you know what? I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what happened. We were young, we were very much in love, but we could only communicate through a time-traveling mailbox at my lake house.\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s not enough that you made me watch that movie, but now you mock me with it?\nScene: The university cafeteria.\nSheldon: Gentlemen, I have a question about dating and relationships.\nRaj: You told me you were going to have the talk with him.\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99ve been waiting for someone to have the talk with me.\nSheldon: More to the point, it\xe2\x80\x99s about finding a way to keep Leonard and Stephanie together.\nHoward: Oh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you can.\nSheldon: Well, why not?\nHoward: Look at Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s record. 27 days with Joyce Kim.\nRaj: During which she defected to North Korea.\nHoward: Two booty calls with Leslie Winkle.\nRaj: For which she awarded him the nickname \xe2\x80\x9cspeed of light Leonard.\xe2\x80\x9d\nHoward: And a three hour dinner with Penny.\nRaj: Which would have been two and a half if they ordered the souffle when they sat down.\nHoward: Based on the geometric progression, his relationship with Stephanie should have ended after 20 minutes.\nSheldon: Yes, I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of the math, Y equals 27 days over 12 to the nth, the issue remains, how do we circumvent his inevitable rejection?\nRaj: Well, if you want to guarantee his appeal to Stephanie, your best bet would be to kill all the other men on the planet.\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do. Don\xe2\x80\x99t spritz him with that body spray from the commercial where the women undress when they smell it, that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work at all, no matter how much you put on.\nSheldon: So, that\xe2\x80\x99s all you\xe2\x80\x99ve got? Apocalyptic genocide and go easy on the cologne?\nHoward: Yes.\nRaj: Yeah.\nScene: Outside Penny\xe2\x80\x99s door.\n  Sheldon (Knock, knock, knock) : Penny (knock, knock, knock) Penny.\nPenny: What?\nSheldon (Knock, knock, knock) : Penny. Zucchini bread.\nPenny: Oh, thank you.\nSheldon: May I come in?\nPenny: No.\nSheldon: I see. Apparently my earlier inquiry regarding you and Leonard crossed some sort of line. I apologize.\nPenny: Well, thank you.\nSheldon: So, have you and I returned to a social equilibrium?\nPenny: Yes.\nSheldon: Great. New topic. Where are you in your menstrual cycle?\nPenny: What?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99ve been doing some research online, and apparently female primates, you know, uh, apes, chimpanzees, you, they find their mate more desirable when he\xe2\x80\x99s being courted by another female. Now, this effect is intensified when the rival female is secreting the pheromones associated with ovulation. Which brings me back to my question, where are you in (Penny slams door). Clearly, I\xe2\x80\x99m 14 days too early.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: All I\xe2\x80\x99m saying is if they can cure yellow fever and malaria, why can\xe2\x80\x99t they do something about lactose intolerance?\nSteph: Leonard, you\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to let this go. You had a little cheese dip, you farted, I thought it was cute.\nSheldon: Oh, hi Stephanie.\nSteph: Hi.\nLeonard: Want some more wine?\nSteph: Yeah, I assume I\xe2\x80\x99m not driving anywhere tonight. (Sheldon lets out a loud noise).\nLeonard: What are you doing?\nSheldon: I have a craving for white asparagus that apparently is destined to go unsatisfied.\nLeonard: Excuse me. What the hell is wrong with you?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m helping you with Stephanie.\nLeonard: By making constipated moose sounds?\nSheldon: When I fail to open this jar and you succeed it will establish you as the alpha male. You see, when a female witnesses an exhibition of physical domination she produces the hormone oxytocin. If the two of you then engage in intercourse this will create the biochemical reaction in the brain which lay people naively interpret as falling in love.\nLeonard: Huh? Would it work if I just punched you in the face?\nSheldon: Yes, actually it would, but let\xe2\x80\x99s see how the lid goes. I\xe2\x80\x99m not strong enough, Leonard, you\xe2\x80\x99ll have to do it.\nLeonard: Oh, for god\xe2\x80\x99s sakes.\nSheldon: Go ahead, it\xe2\x80\x99s pre-loosened.\nSteph: Do you want some help with that?\nLeonard: No, no, no, I got it.\nSheldon: No, yeah, yeah, he\xe2\x80\x99s got it, and that\xe2\x80\x99s not surprising. This is something I long ago came to peace with in my role as the beta male. Open it. (Leonard tries again. Then taps jar on counter. Jar breaks.)\nSteph: Oh my god, are you okay?\nLeonard: No, I\xe2\x80\x99m not. I\xe2\x80\x99m bleeding.\nSheldon: Like a gladiator!\nSteph: Oh, honey, you\xe2\x80\x99re going to need stitches.\nLeonard: Stitches? With a needle?\nSteph: Well, yeah, I mean, just a few.\nLeonard: Oh, okay, yeah, hang on a sec. (Throws up in sink)\nSheldon: FYI, I was defrosting a steak in there.\nScene: The hospital.\nSheldon: What a beautiful job Stephanie did. I might have gone with a mattress suture instead of a blanket stitch, but you can\xe2\x80\x99t argue with her results. It\xe2\x80\x99s a shame it won\xe2\x80\x99t scar, the war wound is a time-honoured badge of masculinity.\nLeonard: I can\xe2\x80\x99t remember a time when you weren\xe2\x80\x99t talking.\nSheldon: Just for the record, my efforts to establish you as the alpha male were not aided by you bursting into tears.\nLeonard: I did not burst into tears, my eyes just got a little watery.\nSheldon: Watery?\nLeonard: She stuck a needle into my hand!\nSteph: Hey, how\xe2\x80\x99s my big cry baby?\nLeonard: I didn\xe2\x80\x99t cry.\nSteph: Okay, I\xe2\x80\x99m just teasing you. But, yeah, you did. Alright, it\xe2\x80\x99s all good. what do you say we get you home and put you to bed?\nLeonard: Oh, are you still going to spend the night?\nSteph: Uh, no, I think that you probably need to rest.\nSheldon: She\xe2\x80\x99s right, as long as you\xe2\x80\x99re vomiting, coitus is contra-indicated.\nLeonard: Thank you, Dr. Cooper.\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re welcome, Dr. Hofstadter.\nSteph: Okay, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to go get your discharge papers.\nLeonard (after Sheldon tuts): What?\nSheldon: Well, you seem like a perfectly pleasant person. I just can\xe2\x80\x99t understand why women have such a hard time loving you.\nScene: The Apartment.\n  Leonard: Hey, can you open this for me?\nRaj: Can I see your stitches?\nLeonard: Sure. (Holds out hand. Howard starts to retch).\nRaj: Answering the question once and for all why Wolowitz bailed out of medical school.\nPenny (entering): Leonard, congratulations.\nLeonard: What for?\nPenny: Your facebook status update. Leonard Hofstadter is in a relationship.\nLeonard: What? no. no, that\xe2\x80\x99s not right.\nHoward: Oh, man, did you switch your status before she did? Speaking as an expert, way to look needy.\nPenny: Seriously? You went first, after only two weeks? That\xe2\x80\x99s bold.\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s not bold, it\xe2\x80\x99s a mistake. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t change my status.\nPenny: Well, then who did?\nSheldon: I had no choice, he cried in front of her.\nLeonard: You hacked my facebook account?\nSheldon: Oh, it\xe2\x80\x99s hardly hacking when you use the same password for everything, Kal-el.\nLeonard: Are you insane? Now she\xe2\x80\x99s going to think I\xe2\x80\x99m desperate. You\xe2\x80\x99ve destroyed this relationship! And you want to know what the worst part is? You don\xe2\x80\x99t even understand what you did wrong because you can\xe2\x80\x99t conceive of something that you are not an expert in!\nSheldon: In which I am not an expert.\nLeonard: Don\xe2\x80\x99t even! I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to hear another word out of you.\nPenny (after Raj lets out a noise): What\xe2\x80\x99s wrong, Lassie? Timmy fall down the well? (He points) Oh, wow. She just updated her facebook status.\nHoward: Stephanie Barnett is in a relationship with Leonard Hofstadter.\xe2\x80\x9d\nLeonard: Really? Oh, look at that, I have a girlfriend.\nSheldon: If I am permitted to speak again, Dr. Sheldon Cooper for the win.\n  Advertisements\nLoading...'
