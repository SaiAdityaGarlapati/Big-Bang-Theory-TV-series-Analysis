b'Scene: Leonard and Penny\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom.\nLeonard: Hey.\nPenny: Hi, how was the screening?\nLeonard: Oh, Sheldon invoked Rosa Parks to make somebody who cut the line feel bad, but only the white people felt bad.\nPenny: Ugh, I should\xe2\x80\x99ve never bought him that colouring book that explains Black History Month.\nLeonard: How\xe2\x80\x99d it go with my mother?\nPenny: Uh, you know, it started a little rocky, but I think we got to a good place.\nLeonard: Wow. Well done.\nPenny: Yeah, and when I dropped her off at the hotel, she even gave me a hug.\nLeonard: Did she think you were choking or\xe2\x80\xa6 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, that\xe2\x80\x99s great. Thank you for spending time with her.\nPenny: No problem. Um, so listen, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if you have any plans next weekend, but I kind of promised your mom we\xe2\x80\x99d have another wedding ceremony so she could attend this time.\nLeonard: Wait, we\xe2\x80\x99re gonna get married again?\nPenny: Yeah, kind of, but now we can invite our friends and family.\nLeonard: Seems like a lot of trouble for a hug.\nPenny: Come on, it\xe2\x80\x99ll be fun, and, you know, your mom was genuinely hurt we didn\xe2\x80\x99t invite her to the first one.\nLeonard: Look, in our defence, it was kind of a spur of the moment thing, and also, we don\xe2\x80\x99t like her.\nPenny: Leonard, come on, she\xe2\x80\x99s your mom. If we can do something to make her happy, why wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t we?\nLeonard: I just said why, we don\xe2\x80\x99t like her.\nPenny: Hey, look, then forget about her, let\xe2\x80\x99s do it for us. We could keep it small and informal. This time we can invite our families.\nLeonard: Is your brother out of prison?\nPenny: Thanks to overcrowding, yeah.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99d love it if my dad could come.\nPenny: Oh, you have to invite him. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen him since the divorce.\nLeonard: Oh, he\xe2\x80\x99s like a different man. He stopped twitching, and I think he grew an inch and a half.\nPenny: Well, then it\xe2\x80\x99s settled. Yay. So funny. I never thought my second marriage would be to you.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The apartment.\nPenny: Okay, so it\xe2\x80\x99s not a legal ceremony, it\xe2\x80\x99s just a chance for us to redo our vows so everyone can be part of it.\nAmy: So there\xe2\x80\x99s no maid of honour?\nPenny: No.\nAmy: Huh. But if I were to, say, wear a purple satin dress with a sweetheart neckline and stand near you, you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be able to stop me, right?\nPenny: I don\xe2\x80\x99t see how I could.\nAmy: Then I graciously accept.\nBernadette: Who\xe2\x80\x99s going to officiate?\nPenny: I was kind of hoping you would.\nAmy: Wait, now I\xe2\x80\x99m just some lousy maid of honour?\nSheldon: Hey, good news, I just got off the phone with my mother. She is coming to the wedding.\nPenny: Okay, wait, you\xe2\x80\x99re inviting people to our wedding?\nSheldon: Yes, I\xe2\x80\x99m inviting people to our wedding. Yeah, I\xe2\x80\x99ve already asked Stephen Hawking and Robert Downey Jr, and, now don\xe2\x80\x99t get your hopes up, \xe2\x80\x99cause he\xe2\x80\x99s pretty busy, but Erno Rubik.\nBernadette: Who\xe2\x80\x99s Erno Rubik?\nSheldon: Seriously? He invented the Rubik\xe2\x80\x99s Cube.\nPenny: Okay, fine, but why would you invite him to our wedding?\nSheldon: Because, despite his fame and fortune, he strikes me as a lonely man.\nBernadette: Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s very sweet of you to go to all this trouble for Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s mother.\nPenny: Yeah, I\xe2\x80\x99m also doing it for Leonard. I think this could really help their relationship.\nScene: Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s car.\nBeverly: How dare you invite your father without consulting me.\nLeonard: Sorry, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I need your permission to have my father at my wedding.\nBeverly: You do understand our marriage ended because he had an affair.\nLeonard: I know, and there\xe2\x80\x99s no excuse for that.\nBeverly: He claimed I was cold, emasculating, and hadn\xe2\x80\x99t shown him any physical affection for years.\nLeonard: I was wrong, there\xe2\x80\x99s three excuses for that.\nScene: Howard\xe2\x80\x99s workshop.\nHoward: Oh, my God. It\xe2\x80\x99s working.\nRaj: You sure?\nHoward: Look. The system is maintaining its own stability, the quantum vortex apparatus is now controlling the orientation.\nRaj: You\xe2\x80\x99re right. You realize what this means?\nHoward: Yeah. I do. It\xe2\x80\x99s proof of concept. We\xe2\x80\x99ve got a workable guidance system.\nRaj: Congratulations.\nHoward: Thanks. Hey, I just got an e-mail from the U.S. Air Force.\nRaj: Open it.\nHoward: Hmm. We request a meeting at your earliest convenience regarding your quantum guidance system, provisional patent 62/295118. That\xe2\x80\x99s weird.\nRaj: Is there a window around here we don\xe2\x80\x99t know about?\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m sure it\xe2\x80\x99s just a coincidence.\nRaj: Yeah, of course. What else could it be? Boy, do I love America.\nScene: Amy\xe2\x80\x99s car.\nMary Cooper: Thank you for picking me up.\nSheldon: Oh, you\xe2\x80\x99re welcome.\nMary: I was speaking to your young lady.\nAmy: My pleasure, Mrs. Cooper.\nMary: Oh, please call me Mary.\nAmy: Okay, Mary.\nSheldon: You know, that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work for me, let\xe2\x80\x99s stay with Mrs. Cooper.\nMary: Sheldon, don\xe2\x80\x99t be silly.\nSheldon: Wu-wu, what? That\xe2\x80\x99s what I called you till I got to know you better.\nMary: It was so nice of Leonard and Penny to invite me.\nSheldon: Well, actually, I\xe2\x80\xa6\nAmy: It sure was.\nMary: I\xe2\x80\x99ve always had a special place in my heart for Leonard. Taking care of my baby all these years.\nSheldon: Excuse me, I take care of him.\nMary: Sure you do. So who else is coming to this shindig?\nAmy: Oh, well, the usual gang. Penny\xe2\x80\x99s family is coming tomorrow.\nSheldon: Yeah, and Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s mother\xe2\x80\x99s already here.\nMary: Oh, Beverly. How nice.\nAmy: You\xe2\x80\x99ve met her, right?\nMary: Yes, I have.\nSheldon: Mother, she\xe2\x80\x99s an atheist, not a vampire.\nMary: Either way, let\xe2\x80\x99s stop and get some garlic.\nScene: The apartment.\nBeverly: So, Mary, how have you been?\nMary: Well, thank you so much for asking. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been well, and you?\nBeverly: Very good.\nMary: Good.\nSheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what we were worried about, they\xe2\x80\x99re getting along great.\nMary: Sheldon tells me your husband\xe2\x80\x99s coming.\nBeverly: My ex-husband.\nMary: Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m so sorry.\nBeverly: Don\xe2\x80\x99t be.\nMary: All right.\nPenny: Whew, chilly.\nAmy: I think I can see my breath.\nBeverly: We can hear you.\nPenny: Sorry.\nAmy: Sorry.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s kitchen.\nHoward: I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe I was so naive. The military is just gonna take over the whole project. And you know what happens if we object? We disappear. Like off the map. Like every American Idol winner since season four.\nBernadette: Come on, Howard, you\xe2\x80\x99re overreacting.\nHoward: Am I? Am I? What, what do you want to bet some black ops guy is reprinting my high school yearbook and I\xe2\x80\x99m no longer in it? That chess club picture is now just David Zimmerman and Elaine Cho.\nRaj: Okay, look, I\xe2\x80\x99m on the Air Force Web site, and the department that e-mailed you is in charge of acquisitions. So maybe they just want to give you a lot of money for your invention.\nHoward: Oh, please, that\xe2\x80\x99s not how it works. You saw E.T., Avatar, Jurassic World. The military just shows up and takes over.\nBernadette: You do realize those weren\xe2\x80\x99t documentaries, right?\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, you find this funny?\nRaj: No, I was just thinking about Jurassic World. Boy, that was terrible.\nScene: The foyer.\nLeonard: Oh, we have to use the stairs.\nAlfred Hofstadter: When are they gonna fix your elevator?\nLeonard: Uh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t, any day now.\nAlfred: Well, the stairs are fine. Besides, your mother is up there. Maybe I\xe2\x80\x99ll have a heart attack and not have to see her.\nLeonard: Hey, I, I know things are a little rough with you and Mom, but I\xe2\x80\x99m really glad you\xe2\x80\x99re here.\nAlfred: Me, too. I should have never had that angioplasty because I feel fine.\nLeonard: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s really looking forward to seeing you.\nAlfred: Ah, she\xe2\x80\x99s a sweetie. You got a good one there, Leonard.\nLeonard: Thanks, Dad.\nAlfred: How the hell did you do that?\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Isn\xe2\x80\x99t this nice?\nLeonard: Hey, we\xe2\x80\x99re here.\nPenny: Alfred. Thank you for coming!\nAlfred: Oh. Well, happy to be here. And congratulations.\nPenny: Thank you.\nLeonard: Dad, you remember Sheldon.\nSheldon: Dr. Hofstadter.\nAlfred: Dr. Cooper.\nLeonard: This is Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s mother, Mary.\nAlfred: How do you do?\nMary: Nice to meet you.\nLeonard: And his girlfriend, Amy.\nAlfred: A pleasure.\nAmy: Hi.\nLeonard: And, of course, Mom.\nAlfred: Hello, my hateful shrew.\nBeverly: Hello to you, you wrinkled old bastard.\nSheldon: All right, now I\xe2\x80\x99m starting to sense a little tension.\nLeonard: All right, you two, don\xe2\x80\x99t start. Penny and I are throwing this second wedding for your benefit. Can you please not ruin it?\nAlfred: Of course. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.\nBeverly: Oh, look at that, you can apologize.\nLeonard: Mom.\nBeverly: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.\nMary: You know, the Bible says forgiveness\xe2\x80\xa6\nSheldon: Mom.\nMary: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.\nPenny: Uh, who\xe2\x80\x99s hungry? We have a reservation at the best restaurant in town.\nSheldon: It only got three-and-a-half stars on Yelp.\nAmy: Sheldon.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m not sorry. That\xe2\x80\x99s true.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s kitchen.\nHoward: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to do. It\xe2\x80\x99s the Air Force. I mean, should I respond to their e-mail? Ignore it?\nRaj: You can\xe2\x80\x99t ignore it. It\xe2\x80\x99s not that postcard that says it\xe2\x80\x99s time to go back to the dentist.\nBernadette: Guys, come on. We\xe2\x80\x99re meeting everyone for dinner.\nHoward: One sec. I\xe2\x80\x99m just afraid if I respond, then they\xe2\x80\x99ll know I got it.\nRaj: Oh, dude. The minute you opened that e-mail, they knew you got it. I mean, they\xe2\x80\x99re probably looking at you through the camera right now. I love America.\nBernadette: Are you done with this nonsense?\nHoward: It\xe2\x80\x99s not nonsense. This is how the U.S. military works.\nRaj: Oh, if it\xe2\x80\x99s even the U.S. Military. It could be foreign military pretending to be American.\nHoward: You\xe2\x80\x99re right. We turn our guidance system over to them, next thing we know, they\xe2\x80\x99re using it against us.\nRaj: I also love the enemies of America.\nScene: Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s car.\nBeverly: Penny, I hope the example of my failed marriage to Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s father doesn\xe2\x80\x99t discourage you from the commitment you\xe2\x80\x99ve made to one another.\nPenny: No, of course not.\nBeverly: Although Alfred and I had a lot more going for us than you two.\nLeonard: Mom, please save something for the toast.\nScene: Amy\xe2\x80\x99s car.\nMary: So, Alfred, what is it that you do for a living?\nAlfred: Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m an anthropologist. I study ancient peoples and cultures.\nMary: My goodness, so all the way back to the Flood.\nSheldon: Don\xe2\x80\x99t laugh, she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t joking.\nAmy: Play with your phone.\nAlfred: Well, on that note, there are many cultures that have an apocalyptic flood as part of their mythology.\nMary: I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a mythology. I have the unerring Word of God. But that\xe2\x80\x99s very interesting.\nAlfred: Oh. I, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to disparage your faith. Actually, I admire it.\nMary: Really?\nAlfred: Yes. Yes, I\xe2\x80\x99m an agnostic myself, but I have prayed, many times, to God, to turn my wife into a pillar of salt.\nMary: Well, He came close. Turned her into a giant block of ice.\nScene: Howard\xe2\x80\x99s car.\nRaj: Howard, there must be someone at the university you can go to for help.\nHoward: Are you kidding? They\xe2\x80\x99re probably the ones who leaked it to the military in the first place.\nRaj: What about the guy on the Channel Four News? You know, Four on Your Side? Maybe he can be on your side.\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m being harassed by the government, not trying to get to the bottom of a dog-walking scam.\nBernadette: Oh, stop. You know what\xe2\x80\x99s really happening? All the movies you\xe2\x80\x99ve watched, the TV shows, the comic books, they\xe2\x80\x99ve completely twisted your thinking. No one\xe2\x80\x99s after you, no one\xe2\x80\x99s listening to you, no one cares about you.\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99d like to think the Four on Your Side guy cares about me.\nScene: Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s car.\nPenny: You know, Beverly, I know you and Alfred have your differences, but if you think about it, if you hadn\xe2\x80\x99t married him, there\xe2\x80\x99d be no Leonard. So that\xe2\x80\x99s good, right?\nBeverly: Yeah.\nLeonard: Is that Howard in front of us?\nPenny: Oh, maybe. Get closer.\nHoward\xe2\x80\x99s car.\nHoward: Oh, God. I think someone\xe2\x80\x99s following us.\nBernadette: You\xe2\x80\x99re being ridiculous.\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m not being ridiculous, he\xe2\x80\x99s right on my tail.\nRaj: Uh, turn left here and see if he turns with us.\nLeonard\xe2\x80\x99s car.\nPenny: Well, why is he turning here? The restaurant\xe2\x80\x99s the other way.\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. He uses that traffic app. Maybe there\xe2\x80\x99s an accident.\nPenny: Oh, so follow him.\nHoward\xe2\x80\x99s car.\nRaj: Oh, no.\nHoward: I told you.\nBernadette: It\xe2\x80\x99s probably just a coincidence. Speed up a little, see if he stays with you.\nLeonard\xe2\x80\x99s car.\nPenny: Well, go faster. You\xe2\x80\x99re losing him.\nLeonard: What is his hurry?\nPenny: You know what, flash your lights. Let him know it\xe2\x80\x99s you.\nHoward\xe2\x80\x99s car.\nHoward: He\xe2\x80\x99s flashing his lights. What\xe2\x80\x99s that mean?\nRaj: I, I think he wants us to pull over.\nBernadette: Do not pull over. I\xe2\x80\x99m not raising this baby alone.\nHoward: Hang on.\nScene: The restaurant.\nAlfred: So, after your husband passed, you never remarried?\nMary: No, just focused on work and the church.\nAlfred: Ah. And what do you do?\nMary: I work at the church.\nAlfred: Well, they\xe2\x80\x99re lucky to have you.\nMary: Well, thank you.\nAlfred: You\xe2\x80\x99re welcome.\nAmy: Do you realize what\xe2\x80\x99s happening here?\nSheldon: Yeah, I do. They\xe2\x80\x99re filling up on bread and ruining their meal.\nLeonard: Hey.\nPenny: Hey.\nAmy: What took you guys so long?\nLeonard: Oh, we were following Howard, but for some reason, he turned off his headlights and went up a one-way street.\nPenny: So, what did we miss?\nAlfred: Oh, just Mary and I getting to know each other a little.\nMary: Leonard, your father is just charming.\nBeverly: He\xe2\x80\x99s also broke. Did he mention that?\nLeonard: Okay, Mom, you sit over there.\nPenny: Yeah, I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna call Bernadette and see what\xe2\x80\x99s keeping them.\nSheldon: If I\xe2\x80\x99d known you were broke, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have made a big deal about the bread.\nScene: Howard\xe2\x80\x99s car.\nBernadette (on phone): Hey, Penny. What are you talking about? Oh, that was you? Long story. Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you go ahead and eat. We\xe2\x80\x99re gonna be a while.\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m telling you, I\xe2\x80\x99m not on drugs. The government\xe2\x80\x99s out to get me.\nScene: The restaurant.\nAlfred: Now, one of the more exciting things to be found recently is that Neanderthals and Homo Sapiens frequently mated with each other.\nMary: Well, that certainly explains my marriage to Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s father.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s funny, because my father was not a very clever man.\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99d be lost without you.\nLeonard: Uh, I would like to propose a toast to my wife and bride-to-be.\nSheldon: See, that\xe2\x80\x99s funny because\xe2\x80\xa6\nAmy: Back to your phone.\nLeonard: Penny, I\xe2\x80\x99ve always known I loved you, but this last year has shown me that I also love being married to you. Thank you for saying yes.\nPenny: Oh, thanks for asking until I did.\nAmy: Hear, hear.\nLeonard: Cheers.\nAlfred: I, uh, I would also like to make a toast.\nPenny: Aw.\nAlfred: Leonard, I am so happy that you have found a woman who loves and cares for you.\nBeverly: What the hell is that supposed to mean?\nAlfred: Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you take a pill?\nBeverly: Like you did before sex?\nAlfred: What I really needed was a blindfold.\nMary: All right, everyone, calm down. Let\xe2\x80\x99s all remember what it says in the Bible: He who is slow to anger is better than the mighty.\nBeverly: Oh, dear woman, can you please read another book?\nMary: When God writes one, I will.\nPenny: Um, if, if we want to order the souffl\xc3\xa9, we might want to get on that.\nAlfred: Leonard, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind, I, I think I\xe2\x80\x99m a little tired. I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna call it a night.\nLeonard: Sure, Dad.\nMary: I\xe2\x80\x99m a little tuckered out myself, so I will see you all in the morning.\nAlfred: Would you like to share a cab?\nMary: That would be fine.\nAlfred: Where are you staying?\nMary: I\xe2\x80\x99m at the Westin.\nAlfred: Oh, so am I. Can I interest you in a nightcap?\nMary: I think that you could.\nLeonard: What is happening there?\nSheldon: I think it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty obvious. They don\xe2\x80\x99t want dessert \xe2\x80\x99cause they filled up on bread.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: She\xe2\x80\x99s still not answering.\nLeonard: My father\xe2\x80\x99s not texting me back.\nPenny: \xe2\x80\x98Cause they both turned their phones off.\nSheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t like this at all.\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t like it either.\nPenny: Really? \xe2\x80\x98Cause I love it.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
