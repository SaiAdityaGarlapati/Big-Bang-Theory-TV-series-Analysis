b'Scene: The apartment. Leonard is sorting out Chinese food.\nLeonard: Let\xe2\x80\x99s see, Raj was the Kung Palo Chicken.\nPenny: I\xe2\x80\x99m the dumplings.\nHoward: Yes, you are.\nPenny: Creepy, Howard.\nHoward: Creepy good or creepy bad?\nLeonard: Who was the Shrimp with Lobster Sauce?\nHoward: That would be me. Come to Poppa, you un-kosher delight. (To Penny) I\xe2\x80\x99m not necessarily talking to the food.\nPenny: Sit over there.\nSheldon (entering, to Penny who is in his spot): Sit over there. Baby wipe?\nPenny: What do you have\xe2\x80\xa6.\nLeonard and Howard together: Don\xe2\x80\x99t! Don\xe2\x80\x99t! Don\xe2\x80\x99t!\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you why.\nLeonard and Howard: O-o-o-oh!\nSheldon: I had to sanitize my hands because the university replaced the paper towels in the rest rooms with hot air blowers.\nPenny: I thought the blowers were more sanitary?\nLeonard and Howard: Why? Don\xe2\x80\x99t!\nSheldon: Hot air blowers are incubators and spewers of bacteria and pestilence. Frankly it would be more hygienic if they just had a plague infested gibbon sneeze my hands dry.\nRaj (entering excitedly): Hey guys, I just got the most amazing new\xe2\x80\xa6 (spots Penny) ew-ew-ew\nPenny: Gosh, Raj, do you think you\xe2\x80\x99ll ever be able to talk in front of me without being drunk? (Shakes head.) Okay, well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll just, um, go eat by myself.\nLeonard: Penny, you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to do that.\nPenny: No, it\xe2\x80\x99s okay, between (indicates Raj) him not talking, (indicates Sheldon) him talking and\xe2\x80\xa6 (indicates Howard) him, I\xe2\x80\x99m better off alone, so, (to Raj) goodbye you poor strange little man (gives him a kiss and exits.)\nRaj: She\xe2\x80\x99s so considerate.\nHoward: So what\xe2\x80\x99s your news?\nRaj: Remember that little planetary object I spotted beyond the Kuiper belt?\nLeonard: Oh yeah, two zero zero eight NQ sub seventeen.\nRaj: Or as I called it, Planet Bollywood. Anyway, because of my discovery, People magazine is naming me one of their thirty under-30 to watch.\nLeonard and Howard together: Well, wow, that\xe2\x80\x99s incredible.\nSheldon: Excuse me. Thirty what, under thirty what, to watch what?\nRaj: Thirty visionaries under thirty years of age to watch as they challenge the preconceptions of their fields.\nSheldon: If I had a million guesses I never would have gotten that.\nRaj: It\xe2\x80\x99s pretty cool, they\xe2\x80\x99ve got me in with a guy who\xe2\x80\x99s doing something about hunger in Indonesia, and a psychotherapist who\xe2\x80\x99s using dolphins to rehabilitate prisoners, and Ellen Page, star of the charming independent film Juno.\nHoward: Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99d so do her.\nLeonard: You\xe2\x80\x99d do the dolphins.\nHoward: Do I get an honourable mention for designing the telescope camera mounting bracket you used.\nRaj: Sorry, it\xe2\x80\x99s not part of my heartwarming and personal narrative, in which a humble boy from New Delhi overcame poverty and prejudice and journeyed to America to reach for the stars.\nHoward: Poverty? Your father\xe2\x80\x99s a gynaecologist, he drives a Bentley.\nRaj: It\xe2\x80\x99s a lease.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m confused. Was there some sort of peer review committee to determine which scientists would be included?\nRaj: Peer review? It\xe2\x80\x99s People magazine. People picked me.\nSheldon: What people?\nRaj: The people from People.\nSheldon: Yeah, but exactly who are these people? What are their credentials, how are they qualified, what makes accidentally noticing a hunk of rock that\xe2\x80\x99s been traipsing around the solar system for billions of years more noteworthy than any other scientific accomplishment made by someone under thirty?\nRaj: Boy, I bet Ellen Pages friends aren\xe2\x80\x99t giving her this kind of crap.\nLeonard: Are you proud of yourself?\nSheldon: In general, yes.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s office. He is making annotations on his board.\nSheldon: Oh, there\xe2\x80\x99s my missing neutrino. You were hiding from me as an unbalanced charge, weren\xe2\x80\x99t you, you little subatomic Dickens?\nLeonard (entering with Howard): Hi Sheldon.\nSheldon: Here, look, look, I found my missing neutrino.\nHoward: Oh, good, we can take it off the milk cartons.\nLeonard: Well, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to go apologise to Raj and invite him out to dinner.\nSheldon: Apologise, for what?\nLeonard: Well, he came over last night with some pretty good news, and we weren\xe2\x80\x99t very supportive.\nSheldon: I sense you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to tell me something.\nHoward: You were a colossal ass-hat.\nSheldon: Oh! No, I beg to differ. Of the three of us, I was by far the most supportive.\nLeonard: Really, do tell.\nSheldon: How will Raj ever reach true greatness if his friends lower the bar for him? When I was eleven, my sister bought our father a \xe2\x80\x9cworld\xe2\x80\x99s greatest dad\xe2\x80\x9d coffee mug, and frankly the man coasted until the day he died.\nLeonard: Okay, let\xe2\x80\x99s try it this way, what if the People magazine thing is the best Raj is ever going to achieve?\nSheldon: I had not considered that.\nLeonard: Come on.\nSheldon: I often forget other people have limitations. It\xe2\x80\x99s so sad.\nHoward: He can feel sadness?\nLeonard: Not really, it\xe2\x80\x99s what you and I would call condescension.\nScene: Outside Raj\xe2\x80\x99s office.\nLeonard: And when we go in there, let\xe2\x80\x99s show Raj that we\xe2\x80\x99re happy for him.\nSheldon: But I\xe2\x80\x99m not.\nHoward: Well then fake it. Look at me, I could be grinding on the fact that without my stabilizing telescope mount he never would have found that stupid little clump of cosmic schmutz, but I\xe2\x80\x99m bigger than that.\nSheldon: Fine, what do you want me to do?\nLeonard: Smile. (He does, exaggeratedly.)\nHoward: Oh crap, that\xe2\x80\x99s terrifying.\nLeonard: We\xe2\x80\x99re here to see Koothrappali, not kill Batman.\nHoward: Try less teeth. (Does. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t much better.)\nLeonard: Close enough, come on. (Knocking and entering.) Hi Raj.\nRaj: Hey guys, what\xe2\x80\x99s up?\nHoward: We just wanted to invite you out to dinner tonight.\nLeonard: Celebrate your thirty under thirty thing. Right Sheldon? (He smiles.)\nRaj: It\xe2\x80\x99s very nice of you, I would like that.\nGablehauser (entering): Hello boys.\nRaj: Dr Gablehouser.\nGablehauser: Dr Koothrappali.\nLeonard: Dr Gablehauser.\nGablehauser: Dr Hoffstadter.\nSheldon: Dr Gablehauser.\nGablehauser: Dr Cooper.\nHoward: Dr Gablehauser.\nGablehauser: Mister Wolowitz. Boys, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a question for you. Who in this room discovered a star?\nRaj: Actually, 2008 NQ sub 17 is a planetary body.\nGablehauser: I\xe2\x80\x99m not talking about you, I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about me. You, my exotic young friend are my star.\nSheldon: Well, you didn\xe2\x80\x99t discover him, you merely noticed he was here, much like he did with 2008 NQ sub 17.\nLeonard: Sheldon!\nSheldon: Oh, sorry. (Smiles)\nGablehauser: Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got to get you into a better office, something more suited to your status.\nRaj: Really, you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to go to any trouble.\nGablehauser: How about if I put you in Von Gerlick\xe2\x80\x99s old office?\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99d rather have Fishbine\xe2\x80\x99s, it\xe2\x80\x99s bigger.\nGablehauser: Done.\nHoward: Wait a minute, I called dibs on Fishbine\xe2\x80\x99s office the day he started showing up at work in his bathrobe.\nSheldon: He gets a new office, I can\xe2\x80\x99t even get paper towels in the men\xe2\x80\x99s room?\nLeonard: Sheldon.\nSheldon: Damn, this is hard. (Smiles)\nGablehauser: Let me ask you something, what do you think the business of this place is?\nLeonard (after he, Sheldon and Howard whisper to each other): Science?\nGablehauser: Money.\nHoward: Told you.\nGablehauser: And this boy\xe2\x80\x99s picture in People magazine is going to raise us a pile of money taller than\xe2\x80\xa6 well, taller than you (ruffling Howard\xe2\x80\x99s hair.)\nHoward: I have a master\xe2\x80\x99s degree.\nGablehauser: Who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t? Dr Koothrappali, have you ever had lunch in the President\xe2\x80\x99s dining room?\nRaj: I didn\xe2\x80\x99t even know there was a President\xe2\x80\x99s dining room.\nGablehauser: It\xe2\x80\x99s the same food as the Cafeteria, only fresh. Come on little buddy.\nRaj: Okay, big buddy. See you tonight guys. (They leave.)\nLeonard: You can stop smiling now.\nSheldon: Aaaah!\nScene: A restaurant.\nRaj: So anyway, after a fantastic lunch I was whisked off to the People magazine photo shoot\xe2\x80\xa6 have any of you boys ever been to a photo shoot?\nLeonard: No.\nRaj: It\xe2\x80\x99s fantastic, apparently the camera loves me and I it. They shot me in front of a starry background where I posed like this. (Stares into space.) They\xe2\x80\x99re going to digitally add a supernova, they say it\xe2\x80\x99s the perfect metaphor for my incandescent talent.\nSheldon: Right, a ball of hot flaming gas that collapses in on itself. (Leonard nudges him. He smiles. Phone rings.)\nRaj: Excuse me. Oh, it\xe2\x80\x99s my assistant Trevor. Go for Koothrappali. Uh-huh.\nHoward: They gave him an assistant? If I want a new pen I have to go to the bank with wire cutters.\nSheldon (still smiling): Have we at this point met our social obligations?\nLeonard: Not yet.\nRaj: Okay, just put it on my calendar but start thinking of a reason why I can\xe2\x80\x99t go, alrighty? Koothrappali out. God bless that boy, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what I\xe2\x80\x99d do without him.\nLeonard: You just got him this afternoon.\nRaj: Yes, but I\xe2\x80\x99m finding that having a lackey suits me.\nLeonard: A lackey?\nRaj: Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, is that politically incorrect? In India we just call them untouchables.\nSheldon: Now?\nLeonard: Almost.\nRaj: Speaking of untouchables, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got great news for you guys. People magazine is having a reception this Saturday, and I managed to get you invited.\nHoward: Oh, gee, thanks.\nRaj: Oh, you\xe2\x80\x99re welcome. Of course, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get you into the VIP section, because, you know, that\xe2\x80\x99s for VIPs, and you guys are just, you know, Ps.\nSheldon: There\xe2\x80\x99s a tribe in Papua New Guinea where, when a hunter flaunts his success to the rest of the village they kill him, and drive away evil spirits with a drum made of his skin. Superstitious nonsense of course, but one can see their point. (Smiles)\nPenny (bringing another grasshopper): Here you go, Raj, you might want to drink this one slowly.\nRaj: Okay, so, Saturday night, can I count on my posse?\nHoward: Gee, I\xe2\x80\x99d love to Raj, but I can\xe2\x80\x99t make it.\nRaj: Oh, okay, Leonard?\nLeonard: Well, uh, no I\xe2\x80\xa6 the\xe2\x80\xa6 no.\nRaj: Sheldon?\nSheldon: I can make it, but I won\xe2\x80\x99t.\nPenny: What are you guys talking about?\nRaj: Well, there\xe2\x80\x99s a reception for my magazine article on Saturday.\nPenny: And you guys aren\xe2\x80\x99t going? I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe you, Raj is celebrating a tremendous accomplishment and you\xe2\x80\x99re not even going to be there to support him?\nSheldon: A tremendous accomplishment would be if the planetary body he discovered were plummeting toward Earth and he exploded it with his mind.\nHoward: That would be cool. I\xe2\x80\x99d go to that reception.\nPenny: Come on, this is huge, Raj is going to be in People magazine. And he didn\xe2\x80\x99t even have to knock up one of the Spears sisters.\nRaj: Would you like to go with me?\nPenny: Of course I would, I would be honoured.\nRaj: Really? Cool.\nPenny: Shame on you guys. (Leaves)\nRaj: Look at that. I got a date with Penny. I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe it took you a whole year.\nSheldon: Now?\nLeonard: Now. (They all get up and leave. Raj looks around himself, then leans over to the next table.)\nRaj: Hey, buddy. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to be in people magazine.\nCharlie Sheen (turning round): Yeah, call me when you\xe2\x80\x99re on the cover.\nScene: Outside Penny\xe2\x80\x99s door. Raj in a suit knocks on the door with his foot as he has a glass of champagne in both hands. He drinks one. Penny opens door, she is dressed up also.\nPenny: Oh, Raj, look at you!\nRaj: I know, I am resplendent like the noonday sun, am I not?\nPenny: Um, yeah, starting with the champagne a little early aren\xe2\x80\x99t you?\nRaj: It was in the limo. They sent a limo. I have a limo. I just love saying limo. Here, sip on this while you\xe2\x80\x99re getting ready.\nPenny: Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m ready.\nRaj: That\xe2\x80\x99s what you\xe2\x80\x99re wearing.\nPenny: Um, yeah, why what\xe2\x80\x99s wrong with it?\nRaj: Nothing, I was just hoping for something a little more, you know, redonkulous.\nPenny: Yeah, well, this is all the donkulous you\xe2\x80\x99re gonna get.\nRaj: Okey dokey, let\xe2\x80\x99s roll. Alright, it\xe2\x80\x99s time to raise the roof. Oo-ooh, oo-ooh.\nPenny (to Leonard who is just coming up the stairs): Hey Leonard.\nLeonard: Hey.\nRaj: Dude.\nLeonard: You look very nice.\nRaj and Penny together: Thank you.\nPenny: Uh, come on, good night Leonard.\nLeonard: Good night.\nRaj: Hey, Leonard, did you see my limo downstairs.\nLeonard: Yeah.\nRaj: It\xe2\x80\x99s bigger than the house my grandfather grew up in.\nLeonard: Terrific.\nRaj: It has more food too.\nPenny: Alright, come on, come on.\nRaj (leaving, singing): I\xe2\x80\x99m coming up so you better get this party started.\nLeonard (entering apartment): Hey.\nHoward: Hey, good news, you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to sulk about Penny any more, look, there are hundreds of Croatian women just waiting for you to contact them.\nLeonard: Anythingforagreencard.com?\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99ll lend you my user name, it\xe2\x80\x99s wealthybigpenis.\nLeonard: You\xe2\x80\x99re joking.\nHoward: Well, you gotta make it easy for them, they\xe2\x80\x99re just learning English.\nLeonard: Pass.\nHoward: So you\xe2\x80\x99re just going to sit around here and mope while Penny is out with Doctor Apu from the Kwik-e-Mart?\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s not a date, and that\xe2\x80\x99s racist.\nHoward: It can\xe2\x80\x99t be racist, he\xe2\x80\x99s a beloved character on the Simpsons.\nLeonard: Let\xe2\x80\x99s just eat so I can get to bed. With any luck tonight will be the night my sleep apnoea kills me.\nSheldon: Did you remember to ask for the chicken with broccoli to be diced not shredded?\nLeonard: Yes.\nSheldon: Even though the menu description specifies shredded?\nLeonard: Yes.\nSheldon: Brown rice, not white?\nLeonard: Yes.\nSheldon: Did you stop at the Korean grocery and get the good hot mustard.\nLeonard: Yes.\nSheldon: Did you pick up the low sodium soy sauce from the market?\nLeonard: Yes.\nSheldon: Thank you.\nLeonard: You\xe2\x80\x99re welcome.\nSheldon: What took you so long?\nLeonard: Just sit down and eat.\nSheldon: Fine. (Opens carton. Shows it to Leonard in disgust.)\nLeonard: Alright, it\xe2\x80\x99s shredded, what do you want me to do?\nSheldon: I want you to check before you accept the order.\nLeonard: Sorry.\nSheldon: Were you distracted by the possibility that Koothrappali might have intercourse with Penny tonight?\nLeonard: He\xe2\x80\x99s not going to have intercourse with Penny.\nSheldon: Then there\xe2\x80\x99s no excuse for this chicken. You know, this situation with Koothrapali brings to mind a story from my childhood.\nHoward: Oh goody, more tales from the panhandle.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s Northwest Texas, I\xe2\x80\x99m from East Texas, the Gulf region, home to many Vietnamese shrimpers.\nLeonard: Do the shrimpers feature in your story?\nSheldon: No. Anyway, when I was eight, a Montgomery-Ward delivery van ran over our cat, Lucky.\nHoward: Lucky?\nSheldon: Yes, Lucky.\nLeonard: He\xe2\x80\x99s irony impaired, just move on.\nHoward: Okay, dead cat named Lucky, continue.\nSheldon: While others mourned Lucky, I realised his untimely demise provided me with the opportunity to replace him with something more suited to my pet needs. A faithful companion that I could snuggle with at night, and yet would be capable of killing upon telepathic command.\nHoward: So, not a puppy?\nSheldon: Please, no, nothing so pedestrian. I wanted a griffin.\nLeonard: A griffin?\nSheldon: Yes, half eagle, half lion.\nLeonard: And mythological.\nSheldon: Irrelevant. See, I was studying recombinant DNA technology and I was confident I could create one, but my parents were unwilling to secure the necessary eagle eggs and lion semen. Course my sister got swimming lessons when she wanted them.\nHoward: Sheldon, not that we don\xe2\x80\x99t all enjoy a good lion semen story, what\xe2\x80\x99s your point.\nSheldon: My point is, if Koothrappali is moving on to a new life of shallow, undeserved fame, perhaps this is an opportunity to create a better cohort.\nLeonard: You want to breed a new friend?\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s one option, but who has the time? But consider this, the Japanese, they\xe2\x80\x99re doing some wonderful work with artificial intelligence, now, you combine that with some animatronics from the imagineers over at Disney, next thing you know, we\xe2\x80\x99re playing Halo with a multi-lingual Abraham Lincoln.\nHoward: Sheldon, don\xe2\x80\x99t take this the wrong way, but, you\xe2\x80\x99re insane.\nLeonard: That may well be, but the fact is, it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t kill us to meet some new people.\nSheldon: Uh, for the record, it could kill us to meet new people. They could be murderers, or the carriers of unusual pathogens, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not insane, my mother had me tested.\nLeonard: If we do get a new friend, he should be a guy you can trust. A guy who has your back.\nHoward: And he should have a lot of money, and live in a cool place down by the beach where we could throw parties.\nSheldon: He should share our love of technology.\nHoward: And he should know a lot of women.\nLeonard: Yeah, let\xe2\x80\x99s see, money, women, technology, okay we\xe2\x80\x99re agreed, our new friend is going to be Iron Man.\nScene: Raj\xe2\x80\x99s apartment. Raj is heard singing in a drunk voice through the door. He enters with his arm around Penny.\nRaj: Welcome to the Raj Mahal.\nPenny: Yes, it\xe2\x80\x99s very nice, goodnight Raj.\nRaj: No, wait, the evening\xe2\x80\x99s not over.\nPenny: Yes it is.\nRaj: No, it\xe2\x80\x99s time to put on some R. Kelly and suck face.\nPenny: Oh, wow, is the evening over.\nRaj (as a ringing noise is heard): Wait, wait, that\xe2\x80\x99s my mummy and daddy calling from India. I want you to meet my parents.\nPenny: Wait, meet them.\nRaj (inhales deeply, picks up laptop, presses a button. His mother and father appear on the screen): Hello mummy and daddy, good to see you. I\xe2\x80\x99m not drunk.\nMrs Koothrappali: Why would you say that?\nRaj: Just making conversation. Mummy, daddy, I want you to meet my new squeeze, Penny.\nPenny: I am not your squeeze. There is no squeezing.\nDr Koothrappali: I can\xe2\x80\x99t see her, centre her in the frame.\nRaj: Here you go, cute huh?\nMrs Koothrappali: She\xe2\x80\x99s not Indian.\nDr Koothrappali: So, she\xe2\x80\x99s not Indian, the boy\xe2\x80\x99s just sowing some wild oats.\nPenny: No, no, there\xe2\x80\x99s no sowing, no squeezing, and no sucking face.\nMrs Koothrappali: What if he gets her pregnant. Is this little hotsy-totsy who you want as the mother of your grandchildren.\nRaj: What right do you have to pick who I can have children with?\nDr Koothrappali: Look, Rajesh, I understand, you\xe2\x80\x99re in America, you want to try the local cuisine. But trust me, you don\xe2\x80\x99t want it for a steady diet.\nRaj: Now you listen to me, I am no longer a child, and I will not be spoken to like one. Now if you\xe2\x80\x99d excuse me, I have to go throw up.\nMrs Koothrappali: What\xe2\x80\x99s wrong with him?\nPenny: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s the local cuisine. Okay, well, it\xe2\x80\x99s nice to meet you, just gonna set you on down over here, and I\xe2\x80\x99m going to leave so, Namaste. (Leaves, then almost immediately returns) And FYI, you\xe2\x80\x99d be lucky to have me as a daughter-in-law.\nDr Koothrappali: She\xe2\x80\x99s feisty. I like that.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment. She is in her bathrobe. A note slides under the door.\nPenny (opening door to find Raj outside): Raj, what are you doing. (He hands her the note). No. No notes. If you have something to say to me, say it.\nRaj (tries several times. Finally, in a high pitched squeak): Sorry.\nPenny: Oh, sweetie, it\xe2\x80\x99s okay. (She hugs him. As she does, Leonard exits his apartment to see Penny, in bathrobe, hugging Raj who is apparently about to leave. As she goes back inside, Raj turns, smiles, and puts both thumbs up. Leonard turns, with an upset look, to Sheldon who is standing behind him. Sheldon gives him his exaggerated smile.)\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
