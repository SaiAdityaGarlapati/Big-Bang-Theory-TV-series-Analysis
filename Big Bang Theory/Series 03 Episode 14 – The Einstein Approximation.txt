b'Scene: The apartment. Sheldon is stood in the middle of the room. His whiteboard is behind him. Every few moments he turns round suddently.\nPenny: Whatcha doing?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m attempting to view my work as a fleeting peripheral image so as to engage the superior colliculus of my brain.\nPenny: Interesting. I usually just have coffee. You\xe2\x80\x99ve been up all night?\nSheldon: Is it morning?\nPenny: Yes.\nSheldon: Then I\xe2\x80\x99ve been up all night.\nPenny: And you\xe2\x80\x99re stuck?\nSheldon: Why else would a person try to engage their superior colliculus?\nPenny: Oh, sorry, sweetie, I can\xe2\x80\x99t help you till I\xe2\x80\x99ve had my coffee.\nLeonard: Penny, I told you if you don\xe2\x80\x99t put him in his crate at night he just runs around the apartment.\nPenny: What is he doing now?\nLeonard: Mmm, he\xe2\x80\x99s either isolating the terms of his formula and examining them individually, or looking for the alligator that swallowed his hand after Peter Pan cut it off.\nSheldon: Captain Hook\xe2\x80\x99s hand was eaten by a crocodile, not an alligator. If you\xe2\x80\x99re going to mock me, at least get your facts straight.\nLeonard: Aye, aye, Captain.\nSheldon: I can\xe2\x80\x99t see it! It just won\xe2\x80\x99t coalesce.\nLeonard: Maybe you need a fresh start.\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re right. (Takes whiteboard to window and throws it out. Picks up a new one) It\xe2\x80\x99s a great idea, Leonard. Thank you.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The cafeteria.\nSheldon: Electrons move through graphene, act as if they have no mass\xe2\x80\xa6\nHoward: How long has he been stuck?\nLeonard: Intellectually about 30 hours. Emotionally about 29 years.\nSheldon: Unit cell contains two carbon atoms. Interior angle of a hexagon is 120 degrees.\nHoward: Have you tried rebooting him?\nLeonard: No, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a firmware problem.\nRaj (arriving): Hey, it\xe2\x80\x99s Disco Night at the Moonlight Roller Rink in Glendale tonight. Who\xe2\x80\x99s up for getting down?\nHoward: Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s perfect. Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s been hocking me to take her roller skating.\nLeonard: I think Penny likes to skate. The four of us could double.\nHoward: What could be better? We\xe2\x80\x99re in.\nRaj: Great. It\xe2\x80\x99s not like I brought it up because I wanted to go.\nHoward: You can come with us.\nRaj: No, it\xe2\x80\x99s okay. I don\xe2\x80\x99t have to go. I\xe2\x80\x99m happy just to guide you and your ladies to suitable entertainment choices. I\xe2\x80\x99m a walking brown Yelp.com.\nSheldon: Structure, constant structure. One atom\xe2\x80\xa6\nHoward: Boy, he\xe2\x80\x99s really gone, isn\xe2\x80\x99t he?\nLeonard: Yeah, this morning he used a stick of butter as deodorant.\nHoward: I thought I smelled popcorn.\nSheldon: Pattern is the same as fermions, travels on the pathways, hexagonal, it\xe2\x80\x99s always hexagonal\xe2\x80\xa6\nLeonard: I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen him this stuck since he tried to figure out the third Matrix movie.\nRaj (as Sheldon reaches out and grabs from his plate): Hey, those are my lima beans!\nSheldon: Not lima beans, carbon atoms.\nRaj: But if I don\xe2\x80\x99t eat my lima beans, I can\xe2\x80\x99t have my cookie.\nLeonard: Here, you want my peas?\nSheldon: Peas! Perfect, they can be electrons.\nHoward: Want my corn?\nSheldon: Don\xe2\x80\x99t be ridiculous. What would I do with corn?\nLeonard: So roller skating, should we all grab a bite to eat first?\nHoward: Good. P.F. Chang\xe2\x80\x99s? My mom has coupons.\nLeonard: Great. Your mom\xe2\x80\x99s not coming, right?\nHoward: Not this time, I promise.\nRaj: Okay, just to be clear, roller skating was my idea, and I\xe2\x80\x99m very unhappy that you turned it into a double date, and I hope you both fall on your asses and break your coccyxes.\nSheldon: The plural of coccyx is coccyges.\nRaj: Screw you. Give me back my lima beans.\nScene: The stairwell.\nBernadette: Oh, my God, have you ever been so embarrassed?\nPenny: Not recently.\nBernadette: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know which was lamer, their roller-skating or their disco dancing.\nPenny: For me, the worst part was when people saw us leave with them.\nLeonard: You had some nice moves out there, Howard.\nHoward: Thanks. You, too.\nLeonard: Yeah. Did you notice all the people looking at us?\nHoward: Not really. I was in my boogie zone.\nBernadette: When Howard tried to do the splits\xe2\x80\xa6\nPenny: Shh.\nLeonard: Sorry. I\xe2\x80\x99m moving a little slow. I think I bruised my coccyx.\nPenny: Oh, poor baby.\nLeonard: Don\xe2\x80\x99t tell Koothrappali. After you.\nPenny: Oh, what a gentleman. Hey, Sheldon. (Steps on marbles which are all over the floor, screams and falls)\nLeonard: Oh, my God! Are you\xe2\x80\xa6 (falls as well)\nSheldon: Good Lord! You\xe2\x80\x99re ruining everything!\nPenny: Oh, damn.\nLeonard: Are you okay?\nPenny: Do I look okay?\nLeonard: Don\xe2\x80\x99t bark at me. I fell, too.\nPenny: Oh, you\xe2\x80\x99ve been falling all night. You\xe2\x80\x99re used to it.\nHoward: Sheldon, what the hell are you doing?\nSheldon: The same thing I\xe2\x80\x99ve been doing for three days. Trying to figure out why electrons behave as if they have no mass when travelling through a graphene sheet.\nBernadette: With marbles?\nSheldon: Well, I needed something bigger than peas, now, didn\xe2\x80\x99t I?\nBernadette: Sheldon, when was the last time you got any sleep?\nSheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, two, three days. Not important. I don\xe2\x80\x99t need sleep, I need answers. I need to determine where in this swamp of unbalanced formulas squatteth the toad of truth.\nPenny: Toad of truth? Is that a physics thing?\nLeonard: No, that\xe2\x80\x99s a crazy thing.\nBernadette: Okay, Sheldon. What happens to our neuroreceptors when we don\xe2\x80\x99t get enough REM sleep?\nSheldon: They lose their sensitivity to serotonin and norepinephrine.\nBernadette: Which leads to\xe2\x80\xa6?\nSheldon: Impaired cognitive function.\nBernadette: Right, so march in there, brush your teeth and go to bed.\nSheldon: But I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to go to bed.\nBernadette: I\xe2\x80\x99m going to count to three. One\xe2\x80\xa6\nSheldon: Oh, all right.\nLeonard: That was amazing how you handled him.\nBernadette: I know how to deal with stubborn children. My mother used to run an illegal day care centre in our basement.\nScene: Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom.\n  Penny: Leonard, you\xe2\x80\x99re\xe2\x80\xa6 you\xe2\x80\x99re giggling in your sleep.\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s not me, it\xe2\x80\x99s my new ringtone. The Joker from Batman.\nPenny: Well, it creeps me out.\nLeonard: Me, too, but I paid three bucks for it.\nPenny: Just answer the phone.\nLeonard: Hello. Yeah, I\xe2\x80\x99m Leonard Hofstadter. Yeah, yeah, he\xe2\x80\x99s my roommate. Oh, God, is he okay? Yeah, alright, alright, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be right there.\nPenny: What happened?\nLeonard: Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s escaped and is terrorizing the village.\nPenny: Okay. Have fun.\nScene: A children\xe2\x80\x99s play area.\nLeonard: Hi. I\xe2\x80\x99m Dr. Hofstadter. Where is he?\nSecurity Guard: Ball pit.\nLeonard: Thanks for not calling the cops.\nSecurity Guard: Oh, hey, it\xe2\x80\x99s no big deal. My sister\xe2\x80\x99s got a kid who\xe2\x80\x99s special.\nLeonard: Yeah, well, he\xe2\x80\x99s extra special. Hey, Shelly. What you doing?\nSheldon: Size ratio was all wrong. Couldn\xe2\x80\x99t visualize it. Needed bigger carbon atoms.\nLeonard: Sure, sure. How did you get into this place?\nSheldon: Back door has a five-pin tumbler system, single-circuit alarm. Child\xe2\x80\x99s play. You can start sorting protons and neutrons while I build carbon atoms.\nLeonard: No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think so. We need to go home now.\nSheldon: But I\xe2\x80\x99m still working.\nLeonard: If you don\xe2\x80\x99t come out of there, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to have to drag you out.\nSheldon: You can try, but you\xe2\x80\x99ll never catch me. (He disappears under the balls)\nLeonard: For God\xe2\x80\x99s sakes. Sheldon, come here!\nSheldon (popping his head up): Bazinga. (Disappears, pops up in another place) Bazinga. (And again) Bazinga. (And again) Bazinga. (And again) Bazinga.\nScene: Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom. Sheldon is standing over their bed. He knocks on the wall.\n  Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard and Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard and Penny.\nLeonard (Waking up as Penny screams): What! What, what, what?\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard and Penny.\nLeonard: What?\nSheldon: I have good news.\nLeonard: And you had to barge in here and wake us up in the middle of the night?\nSheldon: Your cell phone was off.\nLeonard: Because we didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to be disturbed.\nSheldon: And that didn\xe2\x80\x99t work out, did it?\nPenny: Sheldon, what do you want?\nSheldon: I came to tell you I\xe2\x80\x99ve got the answer.\nLeonard: Really? You figured out the graphene problem?\nSheldon: No, no, I\xe2\x80\x99m still hopelessly stuck on that, but I figured out how to figure it out.\nPenny: Hey, you know what, Leonard, I know I said I could handle your roommate, but I was wrong. We\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to break up.\nLeonard: What are you talking about?\nPenny (as Sheldon sits on the bed): Oh.\nSheldon: Einstein.\nLeonard: Yeah, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to need a little more.\nSheldon: Albert Einstein.\nLeonard: Keep going.\nSheldon: When Albert Einstein came up with special relativity, he was working at the patent office.\nLeonard: So, you\xe2\x80\x99re going to go work at the patent office?\nSheldon: Don\xe2\x80\x99t be absurd. That\xe2\x80\x99s in Washington. You know I could never live in a city whose streets are laid out in a wheel-and-spoke pattern. No. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to find a similarly menial job where my basal ganglia are occupied with a routine task, freeing my prefrontal cortex to work quietly in the background on my problem.\nLeonard: Sounds like a great plan.\nSheldon: Of course it is. Even talking to you is sufficiently menial that I can feel the proverbial juices starting to flow.\nLeonard: Okay, well, thanks for sharing with us. Good night.\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re welcome. Good night to you, too. Oh, by the way, I was watching you sleep for a moment, and I noticed that your snoring seems to be worse when you\xe2\x80\x99re on your back.\nPenny: Leonard doesn\xe2\x80\x99t snore.\nSheldon: No, I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t talking to Leonard.\nLeonard: Told you.\nScene: An employment office\nEmployment Office Assistant: So, Mr. Cooper, you\xe2\x80\x99re looking for a job.\nSheldon: A menial job. Like yours.\nAssistant: Why, thank you for noticing. I\xe2\x80\x99m Menial Employee of the Month. Do you have a particular field in mind?\nSheldon: I do. For thousands of years, the lowest classes of the human race have spent their lives labouring to erect monuments under the lash of their betters, until finally they dropped down and became one with the dust through which they trudged. Do you have anything like that?\nAssistant: No.\nSheldon: Shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you check your database?\nAssistant (clicks her keyboard a few times): No.\nSheldon: You didn\xe2\x80\x99t really type.\nAssistant: I didn\xe2\x80\x99t really have to. So, how about construction?\nSheldon: Oh, that would be good! Sawing, hammering, eating out of a lunch pail as my working-class fellows and I sit perched precariously on a girder high above the metropolis.\nAssistant: No, no. This is putting up sheetrock at a housing project in Rosemead.\nSheldon: I could do that.\nAssistant: Good.\nSheldon: One question.\nAssistant: Yes?\nSheldon: What\xe2\x80\x99s sheetrock?\nAssistant: Moving on. How about doing deliveries for a florist?\nSheldon: That seems acceptable.\nAssistant: Do you have your own car?\nSheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t drive.\nAssistant: Of course you don\xe2\x80\x99t. Mr. Cooper, let me just ask you a question. What was your last job?\nSheldon: Senior theoretical particle physicist at CalTech, focusing on M theory, or, in layman\xe2\x80\x99s terms, string theory.\nAssistant: I see. Just give me a second. Security!\nScene: The Cheesecake Factory.\nPenny: Okay, I\xe2\x80\x99ll get those drinks started for you.\nSheldon (appearing in an apron and carrying a tray): Behind you.\nPenny: Sheldon, what the hell are you doing?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to get these tables cleared. We\xe2\x80\x99re slammed.\nPenny: No, wait, wait, no, wait. Wh.. what are you doing here?\nSheldon: A reasonable question. I asked myself, what is the most mind-numbing, pedestrian job conceivable, and three answers came to mind, uh, toll booth attendant, an Apple Store genius, and what Penny does. Now, since I don\xe2\x80\x99t like touching other people\xe2\x80\x99s coins, and I refuse to contribute to the devaluation of the word genius, here I am.\nPenny: You just, you just walked in and they hired you, just like that?\nSheldon: Oh, heavens, no. Since I don\xe2\x80\x99t need to be paid, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t need to be hired. I simply came in, picked up a tray, and started working for the man. Let me get that plate out of your way.\nPenny: Sheldon, this is ridiculous.\nSheldon: Is it? Just a moment ago I had a minor epiphany regarding the polymer degradation phenomenon while scraping congealed nachos off a plate. Bernadette, table 10 wants their check.\nBernadette: Thanks, Sheldon.\nPenny: Sheldon, wait, this isn\xe2\x80\x99t even what I do. I\xe2\x80\x99m a waitress, not a busboy.\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re right. That is more menial. Hello, I\xe2\x80\x99m Sheldon. I\xe2\x80\x99ll be your server today. I don\xe2\x80\x99t recommend the salmon. I saw it in the kitchen.\nScene: The same, later.\nSheldon: All right, one bacon cheeseburger, breaking two Jewish dietary restrictions simultaneously, kudos. Beer-battered fish and chips. Now, here\xe2\x80\x99s your tartar sauce. I also brought you salsa. It\xe2\x80\x99s a little unconventional, but I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll like it. It\xe2\x80\x99s zingy. And for you, Factory Burrito Grande, no cheese, no sour cream, no ugly consequences from your lactose intolerance. Bon app\xc3\xa9tit.\nLeonard: Hang on. Black beans, not pinto beans?\nSheldon: Yes.\nLeonard: Double guacamole?\nSheldon: Of course.\nLeonard: No cilantro?\nSheldon: Nope.\nLeonard: Lettuce shredded, not chopped?\nSheldon: Yep.\nLeonard: You understand why I\xe2\x80\x99m doing this to you?\nSheldon: I do.\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99ll be all. That was fun.\nRaj: How long can he keep this up?\nLeonard: I heard about this professor at MIT who melted down, bought a van, and spent the rest of his life as a mobile dog groomer.\nRaj: He never went back to the university?\nLeonard: Only to shampoo Professor Chambourg\xe2\x80\x99s shih tzu.\nRaj: Sheesh.\nHoward: I bet if we all chipped in, we could buy Sheldon a van.\nRaj: But he\xe2\x80\x99s afraid of dogs.\nLeonard: Yeah, that\xe2\x80\x99s the only thing wrong with that plan.\nPenny: Hey, guys, sorry you had to wait, but we are swamped. What\xe2\x80\x99s this?\nLeonard: Sheldon took our order.\nPenny: Sheldon doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work here.\nLeonard: Well, honey, not to complain, but we were starting to think you didn\xe2\x80\x99t either.\nSheldon (drops tray. A nearby table claps): Is that really necessary? Good Lord. The interference pattern in the fracture. The motion of the wave through the molecular structure. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been looking at it all wrong. I can\xe2\x80\x99t consider the electrons as particles. They move through the graphene as a wave. It\xe2\x80\x99s a wave! The moment to applaud would be now. Troglodytes.\nPenny: Sheldon, where are you going? Aren\xe2\x80\x99t you going to clean this up?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. I don\xe2\x80\x99t work here.\nScene: The roller disco.\nHoward: Happy now?\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99m on a cloud. Swing me. (Howard swings Raj several times.)\nScene: The ball pit, presumably earlier.\nLeonard: Sheldon, come here.\n(Sheldon once again keeps popping up his head and shouting \xe2\x80\x9cBazinga\xe2\x80\x9d as Leonard flails around trying to catch him.)\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
