b'Scene: On the roof of the apartment building.\nLeonard: Okay, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got power to the laser.\nSheldon: I should\xe2\x80\x99ve brought an umbrella.\nLeonard: What for? It\xe2\x80\x99s not going to rain.\nSheldon: I know that, but with skin as fair as mine, moon burn is a real possibility.\nHoward: That\xe2\x80\x99s a bazinga, right?\nSheldon: One of my best, don\xe2\x80\x99t you think?\nLeonard: Howard, do you want to double-check the equatorial mount on the laser? We need it locked onto the Sea of Tranquility.\nHoward: You got it. Oh, Raj, no. Billions of dollars have gone into inventing the Internet and filling it with pictures of naked women, so we don\xe2\x80\x99t have to peep through windows.\nRaj: It\xe2\x80\x99s not like that, I\xe2\x80\x99m watching someone\xe2\x80\x99s TV. The Good Wife is on. I tell you, this is my new Grey\xe2\x80\x99s Anatomy.\nSheldon: Leonard, Leonard. What is that? What is that?\nLeonard: Relax, it\xe2\x80\x99s just a dirty sock.\nSheldon: How on earth can you say dirty sock and relax in the same sentence?\nLeonard: Sheldon, the world is filled with dirty discarded socks.\nSheldon: Not my world.\nLeonard: Hey, you know who\xe2\x80\x99d really dig seeing this experiment? Penny.\nSheldon: I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t aware that lunar ranging was her thing. Although, I suppose the retro-reflector left on the moon by Neil Armstrong does qualify as a shiny object.\nRaj: Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you ask her to come up?\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, it\xe2\x80\x99s still a little weird since, you know\xe2\x80\xa6\nHoward: She dumped you?\nLeonard: She didn\xe2\x80\x99t dump me. We were just in different places in the relationship.\nSheldon: I fail to see how a relationship can have the qualities of a geographic location.\nHoward: Oh, it\xe2\x80\x99s very simple. Leonard was living in a little town called please don\xe2\x80\x99t leave me, while Penny had just moved to the island of bye-bye.\nLeonard: Screw you guys. I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna go see if she\xe2\x80\x99s home.\nHoward: If it\xe2\x80\x99s not too much trouble, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to point this at the moon now.\nRaj: Wait a second, the good wife is crying. Something\xe2\x80\x99s very wrong.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s door.\nPenny: Oh, hi. What\xe2\x80\x99s going on?\nLeonard: We\xe2\x80\x99re up on the roof bouncing laser beams off the moon.\nPenny: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, what?\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s pretty cool. We\xe2\x80\x99ve got a two-meter parabolic reflector and everything. I thought you might want to see it.\nMan in Penny\xe2\x80\x99s Apartment: That makes no sense.\nPenny: Um\xe2\x80\xa6\nMan: How can you bounce stuff off the moon? There\xe2\x80\x99s no gravity.\nPenny: Uh, Leonard, this is Zack. Zack, Leonard.\nZack: Hey.\nLeonard: Oh, sorry, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know you were busy. Maybe another time.\nPenny: Yeah, maybe.\nZack: Hey, I want to see this laser thing.\nPenny: Oh, but what about the party?\nZack: It\xe2\x80\x99s a surprise party, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter when we get there.\nPenny: Oh, right.\nLeonard: Okay, well, yeah, come on up. So, how\xe2\x80\x99d you two guys meet?\nZack: My company designs the menus for the Cheesecake Factory.\nLeonard: Your company?\nZack: Well,, my dad, but me and my sister are VPs.\nLeonard: So, menus.\nZack: I know it sounds easy but there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of science that goes in designing them.\nScene: The roof.\nHoward: Happy now? I\xe2\x80\x99m moving the dirty sock.\nSheldon: Thank you. Raj, keep an eye out for the other one.\nPenny: Hey, guys, this is my friend Zack.\nZack: Hey.\nSheldon: Hello.\nZack: Whoa! Is that the laser? It\xe2\x80\x99s bitchin\xe2\x80\x99.\nSheldon: Yes. In 1917, when Albert Einstein established the theoretic foundation for the laser in his paper Zur Quantentheorie der Strahlung, his fondest hope was that the resultant device be bitchin\xe2\x80\x99.\nZack: Well, mission accomplished.\nLeonard: Let me explain what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing here. Um, in 1969, the astronauts on Apollo 11 positioned reflectors on the surface of the moon, and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to shoot a laser off one of them and let the light bounce back into this photomultiplier.\nPenny: Oh! That\xe2\x80\x99s very cool.\nZack: One question. How can you be sure it won\xe2\x80\x99t blow up?\nLeonard: The laser?\nZack: The moon.\nSheldon: See, now this is a man for Penny.\nLeonard: Uh, that\xe2\x80\x99s a great question, Zack.\nSheldon: No, it\xe2\x80\x99s not.\nPenny: Sheldon! Play nice.\nSheldon: Well it\xe2\x80\x99s not a great question. How could somebody possibly think we\xe2\x80\x99re going to blow up the moon? That\xe2\x80\x99s a great question.\nLeonard: Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry about the moon. We, we set our laser to stun.\nZack: Smart.\nLeonard: Now, we\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to see the beam when it leaves, but it won\xe2\x80\x99t be strong enough when it comes back to be seen by the naked eye.\nZack: Naked.\nLeonard: Right. Uh yeah, funny. Uh, that device there will measure the photons that return and let us see it on this computer. Raj, get them some glasses.\nZack: Cool, it\xe2\x80\x99s gonna be in 3-D?\nHoward: Preparing to fire laser at the moon.\nSheldon: Make it so.\nHoward: There it is. There\xe2\x80\x99s the spike!\nLeonard: 2.5 seconds for the light to return. That\xe2\x80\x99s the moon! We hit the moon!\nZack: That\xe2\x80\x99s your big experiment? All that for a line on the screen?\nLeonard: Yeah, but, uh, think about what this represents. The fact that we can do this is the only way of definitively proving that there are man-made objects on the moon, put there by a member of a species that only 60 years before had just invented the airplane.\nZack: What species is that?\nSheldon: I was wrong. Penny can do better.\nPenny: Okay, guys, thank you, it\xe2\x80\x99s been fun.\nZack: Yeah, thanks. Should we invite them to the party?\nPenny: No, just keep walking.\nSheldon: He must be very skilled at coitus.\nScene: The apartment.\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99m telling you, dude, the only way to feel better about Penny going out with other guys is for you to get back on the whores.\nHoward: Horse.\nRaj: What?\nHoward: The phrase is get back on the horse, not whores.\nRaj: That\xe2\x80\x99s disgusting, dude.\nHoward: No, it\xe2\x80\x99s not\xe2\x80\xa6 Never mind. He is right, though. If you want, I can turn you on to this great new dating site I found.\nLeonard: No, thanks.\nHoward: You sure? They say they can find a match for anybody.\nLeonard: Have they found a match for you?\nHoward: Tons. I\xe2\x80\x99ve had, like, eight dates in the last month. And twelve if you count the ones who showed up and left.\nSheldon: I can\xe2\x80\x99t bring the nitrogen tank down.\nLeonard: Why not?\nSheldon: All right, let me restate that. It\xe2\x80\x99s very heavy, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99ll help you.\nSheldon: Thank you. Lift with your knees, not your back. Good night.\nRaj: You know what would be fun? Signing Sheldon up for online dating.\nHoward: Yeah, right.\nRaj: No, think about it. We make it an experiment. Like when Frankenstein\xe2\x80\x99s monster was lonely and he found a wife.\nHoward: He didn\xe2\x80\x99t find a wife. They built him a wife out of dead body parts.\nRaj: Okay, we\xe2\x80\x99ll call that plan B.\nScene: The apartment. It is night and the lights are off. Knocking.\nLeonard: Coming!\nPenny: Damn you, you rat bastard.\nLeonard: Are you drunk?\nPenny: Zack was a perfectly nice guy, and then you ruined him!\nLeonard: How did I ruin him?\nPenny: \xe2\x80\x98Cause in the olden days, I never would\xe2\x80\x99ve known he was so stupid.\nLeonard: Come on, he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t that stupid.\nPenny: Yes, he was! He thought you were gonna blow up the moon!\nLeonard: Okay, yeah, he\xe2\x80\x99s stupid.\nPenny: He spent the entire night bragging about how he invented the word appe-teasers.\nLeonard: How is that my fault?\nPenny: You have destroyed my ability to tolerate idiots. Now, come with me.\nLeonard: Where are we going?\nPenny: We\xe2\x80\x99re gonna have sex.\nLeonard: Why? I mean, okay.\nSheldon: What\xe2\x80\x99s going on?\nPenny: Put on your noise-cancelling headphones, \xe2\x80\x99cause it\xe2\x80\x99s gonna get loud.\nSheldon: Oh! Not this again.\nScene: The next morning.\nSheldon: In what universe is this low-pulp? Good morning, Penny.\nPenny: What, do you have eyes in the back of your head?\nSheldon: When one gets beaten up every other day in school, one of necessity develops a keen sense of hearing. Incidentally, one can get beaten up in school simply by referring to oneself as one. I\xe2\x80\x99m making English muffins. Would you like an English muffin?\nPenny: Oh, thanks, I\xe2\x80\x99m not hungry.\nSheldon: FYI, my noise-cancelling headphones proved ineffective last night.\nPenny: Yeah, sorry about that.\nSheldon: As a native Texan, I must say I\xe2\x80\x99ve never heard the phrase yee-haw used in quite that context.\nPenny: Oh, God.\nSheldon: Oh, God. That I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard on multiple occasions. In what universe is that lightly toasted? This has to be the worst day of my life. Good morning, Leonard.\nLeonard: How many times have I asked you not to do that?\nSheldon: Counting this instance? 317.\nLeonard: Where\xe2\x80\x99s Penny?\nSheldon: She returned to her apartment. I presume to shower and vomit. Not necessarily in that order.\nLeonard: I wonder why she didn\xe2\x80\x99t say good-bye.\nSheldon: Are you expecting me to offer an explanation of human behaviour?\nLeonard: I know. I just thought as an outsider, you might be able to provide a fresh perspective.\nSheldon: I have no difficulty believing you\xe2\x80\x99re not butter.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s door.\nLeonard: Oh, hey.\nPenny: Oh, hi. Um, I gotta run. Early shift.\nLeonard: Okay, I\xe2\x80\x99ll walk down with you. So, last night was fun, huh?\nPenny: Yeah, it must have been. I just threw up in my closet.\nLeonard: Bummer. Anyway, I was thinking tonight maybe we could catch a movie.\nPenny: Oh, yeah, tonight\xe2\x80\x99s not great for me.\nLeonard: Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have to be tonight. I\xe2\x80\x99m free pretty much always.\nPenny: Leonard, last night was a mistake.\nLeonard: When you say mistake, do you mean a fortunate mistake, like the discovery of penicillin?\nPenny: Look, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. I was drunk, I was lonely, I hated Zack. Can we just forget it ever happened?\nLeonard: No, it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty well imprinted on my brain. Especially the whole rodeo thing.\nPenny: Oh, God!\nLeonard: So, that\xe2\x80\x99s it? Wham, bam, thank you, Leonard?\nPenny: Look, I said I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. Can\xe2\x80\x99t u please let it go?\nLeonard: How am I supposed to let it go? You used me for sex! Morning, Mrs. Gunderson.\nMrs Gunderson: Good morning, Leonard. Or should I say yee-haw?\nScene: The apartment.\nRaj: Holy crap.\nHoward: What?\nRaj: We finally have proof that aliens walk among us.\nHoward: Excuse me?\nRaj: The dating site matched a woman with Sheldon.\nHoward: You\xe2\x80\x99re kidding. An actual woman?\nRaj: Yeah, look. Breasts and everything.\nHoward: Trust me, breasts doesn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily mean woman.\nRaj: Since when?\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99ll show you a picture of my Uncle Louie in a bathing suit sometime. Leonard, you gotta see this, we found a match for Sheldon.\nLeonard: Great. Maybe she can have sex with him, and then walk out on him the next morning without so much as a how do you do?\nRaj: Do you know what he\xe2\x80\x99s talking about?\nHoward: Nope. Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you ask him?\nRaj: Leonard, what are you talking about?\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to talk about it.\nRaj: That was a lousy suggestion.\nHoward: Whatever. Right now, Dr. Sheldon Cooper has to send an e-mail to his perfect match. Greetings, fellow life-form\xe2\x80\xa6\nScene: A building corridor.\nLeonard: If she can do it, I can do it. If she can do it, I can do it. If she can do it, I can do it. (Knocks on door) I can\xe2\x80\x99t do it.\nLeslie Winkle: Hello?\nLeonard: Oh, hi. Hey. Hi, Leslie.\nLeslie: Leonard Hofstadter. What\xe2\x80\x99re you doing here?\nLeonard: Uh, I know! It\xe2\x80\x99s been a while!\nLeslie: Yeah, 18 months.\nLeonard: Right. Right. So how you doing?\nLeslie: Fine. You?\nLeonard: Uh, not bad. You remember when we used to have sex and you said that it didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean anything, it was just for fun?\nLeslie: Yeah.\nLeonard: Uh, do you, uh, want to do that again?\nLeslie: What happened? Blondie dumped you?\nLeonard: She didn\xe2\x80\x99t dump me. We were just in different places in the relationship.\nLeslie: Right.\nLeonard: Um, anyway, apparently, it\xe2\x80\x99s okay to go back to people you\xe2\x80\x99re no longer seeing and have recreational sex with them.\nLeslie: Uh-huh.\nLeonard: So, what do you say?\nLeslie: Let me think about it. (Slams door.)\nLeonard: She\xe2\x80\x99s not coming back.\nScene: The apartment.\nRaj: Uh-oh. She wants to meet us.\nHoward: Not us. Him.\nRaj: Yes, but him doesn\xe2\x80\x99t even know about her.\nHoward: Well, him about to find out about her.\nRaj: Really? Us gonna tell him?\nSheldon: Who\xe2\x80\x99s going to tell whom about what?\nHoward: Sheldon. Hey.\nRaj: Hi.\nSheldon: Your surprise confuses me. I live here.\nHoward: Right. So, listen, what are you doing tomorrow afternoon?\nSheldon: Be more specific.\nHoward: Four thirty.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s not afternoon. That\xe2\x80\x99s preevning.\nHoward: What?\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s a time of day I invented. It better defines the ambiguous period between afternoon and evening. Preevning. I\xe2\x80\x99m fairly certain it will catch on as it fills a desperate need.\nRaj: Right, okay. What are you doing tomorrow preevning?\nSheldon: Well, tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s Saturday. Saturday night is laundry night, so I\xe2\x80\x99ll be spending the preevning pre-sorting and pre-soaking.\nHoward: Okay, what if I were to tell you, tomorrow, at 4:30 you could meet a woman who has been scientifically chosen to be your perfect mate?\nSheldon: I would snort in derision and throw my arms in the air, exhausted by your constant tomfoolery.\nRaj: But it\xe2\x80\x99s true. But we-we put all your vital information into this dating site, answered all their questions just like you would, and they found a match for you. Her name is Amy Farrah Fowler.\nSheldon: Please. Even assuming you could answer any question the way I would, the algorithms used by matchmaking sites are complete hokum.\nHoward: And that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly the answer we gave to the question, what is your attitude towards online dating\xe2\x80\x9d\nRaj: Howard wanted to write mumbo jumbo, but I said no, our Sheldon would say hokum.\nHoward: Well, come on, where\xe2\x80\x99s your scientific curiosity?\nSheldon: Well, most of it is being applied to unravelling the secrets of the universe while the rest of it\xe2\x80\x99s wondering why I\xe2\x80\x99m having this conversation with you.\nRaj: Okay, how about this. Even Spock had a date once every seven years.\nSheldon: He didn\xe2\x80\x99t date. It was pon farr. His blood boiled with mating lust.\nHoward: Okay, well, why don\xe2\x80\x99t you start with a cup of coffee, and you can pon farr Amy Farrah Fowler later.\nSheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t drink coffee.\nHoward: All right, you can have a hot chocolate.\nSheldon: As I will not be engaging in this nonsense, my choice of beverage is moot. But for the record, I only drink hot chocolate in months with an R in them.\nHoward: Why?\nSheldon: What\xe2\x80\x99s life without whimsy?\nHoward: Okay, I\xe2\x80\x99m out.\nRaj: Sheldon, I\xe2\x80\x99ve hidden the dirty sock from the roof somewhere in your apartment. Unless you are willing to come with us to meet this girl, it will remain there forever.\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re bluffing.\nRaj: Are you willing to risk it?\nSheldon: Curse you.\nScene: The hallway. Leonard is finishing off a bottle of spirits. He opens the lift and drops the bottle inside.\nLeonard: Thirty feet.\nPenny: Oh. Hey, Leonard.\nLeonard: I was a perfectly happy, geeky, little lonely guy, and you ruined me!\nPenny: Are you drunk?\nLeonard: Come on. We\xe2\x80\x99re gonna have sex, and it\xe2\x80\x99s not gonna mean a thing!\nPenny: Are you out of your mind?!\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m really starting to think there\xe2\x80\x99s a double standard here.\nScene: A coffee shop.\nSheldon: In a few minutes, when I gloat over the failure of this enterprise, how would you prefer I do it? The standard I told you so? The classic neener-neener? Or just my normal look of haughty derision?\nRaj: You don\xe2\x80\x99t know we\xe2\x80\x99re wrong yet.\nSheldon: Haughty derision it is.\nAmy: Excuse me. I\xe2\x80\x99m Amy Farrah Fowler. You\xe2\x80\x99re Sheldon Cooper.\nSheldon: Hello, Amy Farrah Fowler. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry to inform you that you have been taken in by unsupportable mathematics designed to prey on the gullible and the lonely. Additionally, I\xe2\x80\x99m being blackmailed with a hidden dirty sock.\nAmy: If that was slang, I\xe2\x80\x99m unfamiliar with it. If it was literal, I share your aversion to soiled hosiery. In any case, I\xe2\x80\x99m here because my mother and I have agreed that I will date at least once a year.\nSheldon: Interesting. My mother and I have the same agreement about church.\nAmy: I don\xe2\x80\x99t object to the concept of a deity, but I\xe2\x80\x99m baffled by the notion of one that takes attendance.\nSheldon: Well, then you might want to avoid East Texas.\nAmy: Noted. Now, before this goes any further, you should know that all forms of physical contact up to and including coitus are off the table.\nSheldon: May I buy you a beverage?\nAmy: Tepid water, please.\nHoward: Good God, what have we done?\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
