b'Scene: The apartment.\nPenny: Oh my God, I love this chicken.\nSheldon: Oh, you know what they say, the best things in life are free.\nPenny: Okay, you\xe2\x80\x99re right, I eat your food a lot. How about this, you can raid my fridge any time you want.\nSheldon: Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s very kind of you. Next time I have a hankering to wash down a D cell battery with a jar of old pickle juice, I\xe2\x80\x99ll come a-knocking.\nHoward: Hey, Raj, you didn\xe2\x80\x99t send your RSVP in. I\xe2\x80\x99m supposed to ask you if you\xe2\x80\x99re bringing someone to the wedding.\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99ll let you know.\nHoward: Well, can you make it soon. There\xe2\x80\x99s a battle royale going on over the seating charts. In one corner, Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s mom, and the other three, mine.\nSheldon: Yeah, I hate wedding receptions. I wish the bride and groom would take a cue from Bilbo Baggins, slip on the ring, disappear and everyone goes home.\nLeonard: Mmm, you liked Professor Guyster\xe2\x80\x99s wedding.\nSheldon: They had a make your own sundae bar. Ooh, that was a night to remember. Do you know, on the one trip, I just had a bowl of nuts.\nHoward: Anyway, you gotta let me know if you have a plus one, because if not my mom\xe2\x80\x99s trying to sneak in the doctor who sucked the fat out of her neck.\nRaj: Alright, uh, fine, I\xe2\x80\x99m coming and I\xe2\x80\x99m bringing somebody. Uh, Koothrappali plus one.\nLeonard: Who you bringing?\nRaj: Who are you bringing?\nPenny: He\xe2\x80\x99s bringing me. Who are you bringing?\nRaj: Wow, what a bunch of Nosey O\xe2\x80\x99Donnells.\nHoward: Come on, who is it?\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99m not telling. I\xe2\x80\x99m from Asia. I\xe2\x80\x99m mysterious. Deal with it.\nSheldon: Howard, are you having a make your own sundae bar?\nHoward: No, uh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think so.\nSheldon: Well you should. 50% of marriages end in divorce, but 100% of make your own sundae bars end in happiness.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: Raj\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nRaj (on skype): Hello Mummy, Daddy, how are you?\nMrs Koothrappali: Pretty good, can\xe2\x80\x99t complain.\nDr Koothrappali: Oh I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you can. Just give it a minute.\nRaj: Listen, uh, there\xe2\x80\x99s something I want to talk to you about. I, I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t ready until now, but I think it\xe2\x80\x99s time.\nDr Koothrappali: It\xe2\x80\x99s finally happening. You\xe2\x80\x99re coming out of the closet, aren\xe2\x80\x99t you?\nMrs Koothrappali: We love you, and we accept your alternate lifestyle. Just keep it to yourself.\nRaj: No, I\xe2\x80\x99m not gay. If anything, I\xe2\x80\x99m metrosexual.\nDr Koothrappali: What\xe2\x80\x99s that?\nRaj: It means I like women as well as their skincare products.\nDr Koothrappali: Well, if you\xe2\x80\x99re not coming out, why did you call us during the cricket semi-finals?\nRaj: \xe2\x80\x98Cause I, I\xe2\x80\x99m tired of trying to meet someone and, I think I\xe2\x80\x99d like you to help me find uh, a wife.\nMrs Koothrappali: And just to clarify, a female wife?\nRaj: Yes.\nDr Koothrappali: Matchmaking, very smart move son. Much better than marrying for love.\nMrs Koothrappali: We married for love.\nDr Koothrappali: And it\xe2\x80\x99s been wonderful.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Quantum physics makes me so happy.\nLeonard: Yeah, I\xe2\x80\x99m glad.\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s like looking at the universe naked. (Shivers)\nPenny: Hi, you guys got a minute?\nLeonard: Sure, what\xe2\x80\x99s up?\nPenny: Well, I was thinking about Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s little joke the other night about me eating all your food.\nSheldon: Oh, that was no joke. But I understand your confusion as I am our group\xe2\x80\x99s resident cut-up.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, you are our resident cut-up?\nSheldon: Yes.\nLeonard: Prove it.\nSheldon: Knock, knock.\nLeonard: Who\xe2\x80\x99s there?\nSheldon: Interrupting physicist.\nLeonard: Interrupting physi\xe2\x80\xa6\nSheldon: MUON!\nPenny: Anyway, I got a little residual cheque from my commercial and I thought, hey, how about I get the guys a little thankyou to pay them back. So, Sheldon, ta-da!\nSheldon: Ah! A vintage, mint in box, 1975 Mego Star Trek transporter with real transporter action. Hot-darn!\nLeonard: Where did you get that?\nPenny: Uh, from Stuart at the comic-book store.\nLeonard: You went to the comic-book store by yourself?\nPenny: Yeah, it was fun, I walked in and two different guys got asthma attacks. Felt pretty good.\nSheldon: Well this calls for an expression of gratitude.\nPenny: Ooh, am I about to get a rare Sheldon Cooper hug?\nSheldon: Not this time. Then they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be special. Thanks Penny.\nPenny: You\xe2\x80\x99re welcome. Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t forget about you. Leonard, I got you a label maker.\nLeonard: Wow. No, it\xe2\x80\x99s great. Also, uh, mint in box.\nPenny: Mmm. And, I got you a transporter too!\nLeonard: Awesome!\nSheldon: Look, it was actually designed for my vintage Mr Spock action figure.\nPenny: Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s great. Let\xe2\x80\x99s open it up and put him in there.\nLeonard: Ah!\nSheldon: Oh dear Lord. No!\nPenny: Why, they\xe2\x80\x99re just toys?\nSheldon: They\xe2\x80\x99re mint in box.\nLeonard: They\xe2\x80\x99re Collectables.\nPenny: C\xe2\x80\x99mon can\xe2\x80\x99t we just open one up and take a\xe2\x80\xa6\nTogether: No!\nLeonard: Once you open the box it loses its value.\nPenny: Yeah, yeah, my mom gave me the same lecture about my virginity. Gotta tell you, it was a lot more fun taking it out and playing with it.\nScene: A restaurant.\nBernadette: Are you sure you want us here when you meet this woman?\nRaj: Oh yes. In my culture it\xe2\x80\x99s expected to have a chaparone to oversee a first date. Plus I want to make a good impression and, no offence, but with you guys here I look like six two.\nBernadette: The nuns always chaparoned the dances at my high school. They used to make us leave room between us for the holy spirit.\nHoward: Hindus do the same thing. Except they leave room for a cow.\nRaj: Listen, I love your charming racist humour, but any chance you could not knock my religion while she\xe2\x80\x99s here.\nHoward: Yesterday you made fun of me for eating lox.\nRaj: It\xe2\x80\x99s different. You\xe2\x80\x99re people don\xe2\x80\x99t worship lox.\nHoward: Well clearly you\xe2\x80\x99ve never been to brunch with my cousins.\nBernadette: So, arranged marriages. The parents just decide, and then you have to get married?\nRaj: Oh, no, no, I get a say in it. But I\xe2\x80\x99m sure whoever shows up will be better company than a threesome I\xe2\x80\x99ve been having with Aunt Jemima and Mrs Butterworth.\nGirl: Excuse me, are you Rajesh?\nRaj: Oh, yes. You must be Lakshmi. Uh, nice to meet you.\nLakshmi: Nice to meet you too.\nRaj: Oh, uh, these are my, my friends. This is Bernadette.\nBernadette: Hello.\nRaj: And this is Howard.\nHoward: Nice to meet you.\nLakshmi: You too.\nRaj: Please have a seat. (To Bernadette) I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking double wedding!\nScene: The apartment.\nVoice of Spock: Dr Cooper. Dr Cooper?\nSheldon: Is someone there?\nSpock: Down here, on your desk.\nSheldon: Spock?\nSpock: I need to speak with you.\nSheldon: Fascinating. The only logical explanation is that this is a dream.\nSpock: It is not the only logical explanation. For example, you could be hallucinating after being hit on the head by, say, a coconut.\nSheldon: Was I hit on the head by a coconut.\nSpock: I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to dignify that with a response. Now, to the matter at hand. You need to play with the transporter toy.\nSheldon: But it\xe2\x80\x99s mint in box.\nSpock: Yes, and to open it would destroy it\xe2\x80\x99s value. But remember, like me, you also have a human half.\nSheldon: Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to dignify that with a response.\nSpock: Consider this. What is the purpose of a toy?\nSheldon: To be played with.\nSpock: Therefore? To not play with it would be?\nSheldon: Illogical. Oh, damn it Spock, you\xe2\x80\x99re right. I\xe2\x80\x99ll do it.\nSpock: Sheldon, wait. You have to wake up first.\nSheldon: Oh, of course. Set phasers to dumb, right? (Wakes up in bed) Goody, goody, goody. This is wrong. This is wrong. I\xe2\x80\x99m so excited, but this is wrong. I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna do it. I\xe2\x80\x99m doing it. I did it. Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s what I always thought 1975 smelled like. One to beam down Mr Scott. Aye, aye, Mr Spock. Energise. (Spins toy). Energise. (Tries to spin toy. It sticks. Tries to get Spock out and toy falls apart.) Don\xe2\x80\x99t be broken. Please don\xe2\x80\x99t be broken. (To Spock toy) What did you make me do? Okay, okay, think. (Sees Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s toy) It\xe2\x80\x99s only logical.\nScene: Raj\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nLakshmi: My goodness, that was delicious.\nRaj: Well, I hope you saved room for chocolate lava cake.\nLakshmi: Impressive. What goes into making something like that.\nRaj: Well, you start off by trying to make chocolate souffle, and when it falls you panic, quickly change the name, and voila! Lava cake.\nLakshmi: I bet our parents are dying to know how things are going here.\nRaj: Well, let\xe2\x80\x99s see. Yup, three missed calls.\nLakshmi: Four missed calls, two text messages, and a failed video chat. I win. So, what are we going to tell them.\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99d like to tell them things are going well.\nLakshmi: Me too. But before we get their hopes up we should probably make sure we\xe2\x80\x99re on the same page.\nRaj: Okay, what page are you on?\nLakshmi: I\xe2\x80\x99m on the one where I\xe2\x80\x99m on a lot of pressure from my parents to get married and settle down, and have a family, and I\xe2\x80\x99m going to do it so they don\xe2\x80\x99t find out I\xe2\x80\x99m gay.\nRaj: Say again.\nLakshmi: I\xe2\x80\x99m gay.\nRaj: Like, dude on dude, but with women?\nLakshmi: I know a fake marriage isn\xe2\x80\x99t an honest way to live, but you of all people must know how difficult it is to come out in our culture.\nRaj: Why me, of all people?\nLakshmi: Well, there is a rumour back in New Delhi that you\xe2\x80\x99re, how shall we say, comfortable in a sari.\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99m not gay.\nLakshmi: Really? The chocolate lava cake? The little soaps in the bathroom? And I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, but you\xe2\x80\x99re wearing more perfume than I am.\nRaj: That\xe2\x80\x99s Unbreakable by Khloe and Lamar. And for your information, it\xe2\x80\x99s unisex.\nLakshmi: Fill in the blank. I love the nightlife?\nRaj: I like to boogie.\nLakshmi: Got you.\nRaj: W-w-with women. I like to boogie with women.\nLakshmi: That\xe2\x80\x99s disappointing. You were exactly the kind of phoney-baloney husband I was looking for.\nRaj: Thankyou. And once again, my baloney likes girls. Wait-wait. You don\xe2\x80\x99t want to put a bit of that in your mouth without trying my homemade chantilly cream. Yeah, okay, that time I heard it.\nScene: Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom. Sheldon writhes in bed, then wakes up on an alien planet.\nSheldon: Oh dear. Two suns and no sunscreen.\nSpock: Hello again, Sheldon.\nSheldon: What is it now, tiny Spock?\nSpock: I am very disappointed in you. You broke your toy and switched it with Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s. You should be ashamed of yourself.\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re the one who told me to play with it.\nSpock: If I told you to jump off the bridge of the Enterprise, would you do it?\nSheldon: No. If I got on the bridge of the Enterprise, I would never, ever leave.\nSpock: Trust me, it gets old after a while. You must right your wrong, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Why? I got away with it. Leonard has his toy, and he\xe2\x80\x99s never going to open it, so he won\xe2\x80\x99t know it\xe2\x80\x99s broken. And I have a toy that isn\xe2\x80\x99t broken. Everybody\xe2\x80\x99s happy.\nSpock: Well I am unhappy.\nSheldon: I thought where you come from they don\xe2\x80\x99t have emotions.\nSpock: I come from a factory in Taiwan. Now do the right thing.\nSheldon: You know what you are? Well, you\xe2\x80\x99re a green blooded buzzkill. Perhaps it\xe2\x80\x99s time you beam on out of here.\nSpock: Fine. I will just use the transporter. Oh, right. You broke it.\nSheldon: Very well. Cooper to Enterprise, one to beam up. Energise. (Throws Spock away. Get\xe2\x80\x99s attacked by a Gorn. Wakes up.) Ah. Tiny Spock. Help.\nScene: Howard\xe2\x80\x99s laboratory. Howard is soldering something.\nRaj: Ready for lunch?\nHoward: Yep, one sec. (Puts thing in mouth.) Ah, good. Ma would have killed me if she\xe2\x80\x99d found out I\xe2\x80\x99d broke my retainer.\nRaj: Hey, uh, can I run something by you? It\xe2\x80\x99s about Lakshmi.\nHoward: Yeah. Sure. How are things going?\nRaj: We hit a couple of bumps. She lives over on Manhattan Beach, so it takes over an hour to get there. And she\xe2\x80\x99s a lesbian.\nHoward: What do you mean, she\xe2\x80\x99s a lesbian?\nRaj: Well, you know whenever you and I would try to hit on women in bars, and they\xe2\x80\x99d blow us off, and then we\xe2\x80\x99d tell each other they were probably gay. It\xe2\x80\x99s like that. Except this time it\xe2\x80\x99s true.\nHoward: Then why did she even go out with you?\nRaj: She was looking for a husband so she can appear to be straight. And you know, it sounded crazy to me at first, but I\xe2\x80\x99m actually thinking about doing it.\nHoward: Okay, well, so the reason that might sound crazy, is \xe2\x80\x99cause it\xe2\x80\x99s crazy.\nRaj: Look, Howard, you\xe2\x80\x99re in a relationship. You know you have to make compromises.\nHoward: Well, yes. But my compromises are about which bedspread to buy, or whose turn it is to do the laundry, Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s or my mom\xe2\x80\x99s.\nRaj: It\xe2\x80\x99s a great deal. We both get our parents off our backs. I don\xe2\x80\x99t have to come home to an empty apartment every night, plus, once I\xe2\x80\x99m married, I can finally eat carbs again and let myself go.\nHoward: Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you tell your parents you want to try and find someone else, you know, maybe one who hasn\xe2\x80\x99t slept with more women than you.\nRaj: Because this one wants to marry me. I might never find another one who does.\nHoward: So you\xe2\x80\x99re seriously thinking about marrying someone you\xe2\x80\x99re never going to have sex with.\nRaj: I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe your attitude. I thought you were in favour of gay people getting married.\nHoward: Yes, to other gay people.\nRaj: Do you hear how homophobic you sound?\nScene: The apartment. Sheldon is working on his laptop. Spock is looking at him judgementally. He switches the two toys.\nSheldon: Oh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want a broken toy. (Switches them back again. Penny and Leonard enter.) Nothing!\nLeonard: What?\nSheldon: Nothing. I said nothing.\nPenny: That was weird.\nLeonard: Really? I don\xe2\x80\x99t even notice any more.\nPenny: I cannot believe you guys aren\xe2\x80\x99t going to play with these.\nLeonard: Well I told you, you don\xe2\x80\x99t, it\xe2\x80\x99s mint in box.\nPenny: I dunno. I just think it\xe2\x80\x99s a waste. (Picks up box. Sheldon screams.) Relax. I\xe2\x80\x99m just looking at the box.\nSheldon: Perhaps you should look with your eyes, and not your muscular Nebraska man-hands.\nPenny: What is your problem?\nSheldon: My problem is that I don\xe2\x80\x99t want you to break Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s toy, which you probably did by shaking it. She shook it. We all saw her.\nPenny: Leonard, I bought you this because I wanted you to have fun with it. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want it to just sit in this box.\nLeonard: You know, you\xe2\x80\x99re right. I mean, it\xe2\x80\x99s from you, I\xe2\x80\x99m never going to sell it. I\xe2\x80\x99m opening it.\nPenny: Yes.\nSheldon: Mmmmm!\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s broken.\nPenny: What?\nSheldon: Oh, nice job, man-hands.\nPenny: I didn\xe2\x80\x99t break it. I, I guess Stuart sold it to me like this.\nSheldon: Yes. Yes, he did, that is a perfectly satisfying and plausible explanation. Yeah, let\xe2\x80\x99s all be mad at Stuart.\nPenny: You know, I paid a lot for this. Let\xe2\x80\x99s take it over there and show him.\nLeonard: Absolutely.\nSheldon: Wait. It was me. I opened your toy, discovered it was broken and didn\xe2\x80\x99t tell you.\nLeonard: Why would you open mine?\nSheldon: I didn\xe2\x80\x99t. That was a lie. I opened my own toy. And it was already broken so I switched them.\nLeonard: Well, you should talk to Stuart.\nSheldon: I can\xe2\x80\x99t because that was a lie. Yours was broken in an earthquake. And that\xe2\x80\x99s a lie.\nPenny: What is the truth?\nSheldon: My Mr Spock doll came to me in a dream and forced me to open it. And when the toy broke I switched it for yours. Later he encouraged me to do the right thing and I defied him. And then I was attacked by a Gorn.\nLeonard: Okay, that I believe.\nPenny: Mmm.\nSheldon: Leonard, Penny, I just, I want you both to know that I regret my actions toward the two of you. That\xe2\x80\x99s a lie.\nLeonard: So, is that one mine.\nSheldon: Yes.\nLeonard: Well, hand it over so I can open it.\nSheldon: Okay. Leonard, even though I don\xe2\x80\x99t have one any more, I hope you have fun playing with it.\nLeonard: And that\xe2\x80\x99s a lie, right?\nSheldon: Big fat whopper. I hope it breaks.\nScene: Raj\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nRaj: This is a treat, what brings you guys by?\nBernadette: Raj, Howie told me what\xe2\x80\x99s going on with you and Lakshmi.\nRaj: What, you told her?\nHoward: I told everybody.\nBernadette: We believe there\xe2\x80\x99s someone out there who\xe2\x80\x99ll love you for you.\nHoward: Well, actually we kind of agreed to disagree on that one, but we both think you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t marry this woman.\nRaj: So, while I\xe2\x80\x99m waiting for this mysterious perfect match, who may or may not exist, I\xe2\x80\x99m supposed to just be alone.\nBernadette: Not necessarily. I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve found someone for you to cuddle with. (Pulls a puppy out of her bag.)\nRaj: Oh, my goodness. Aren\xe2\x80\x99t you the cutest little Yorkie ever? You got him for me?\nHoward: Her. We thought you two would hit it off.\nRaj: I think we already have. Thank you guys so much. Let\xe2\x80\x99s see if you fit in my man purse.\nBernadette: Metrosexual my ass.\nAdvertisements'
