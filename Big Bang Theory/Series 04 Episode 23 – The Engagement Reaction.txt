b'Scene: The Cheesecake Factory\nPenny: Hey, do me a favour and take table seven.\nBernadette: You mean the one with my one hundred and eighteen-pound rock-hard stud of a fianc\xc3\xa9 who\xe2\x80\x99s prone to canker sores and pinkeye?\nPenny: Nah, I prefer to look at it as the one with my ex-boyfriend and his gorgeous, successful and sophisticated girlfriend, who makes me feel like a toothless Okie.\nBernadette: Do you want me to spill hot soup on her?\nPenny: Oh, please, you\xe2\x80\x99re not that kind of person.\nBernadette: I know. But if she orders something low-fat I\xe2\x80\x99ll totally give her the full-fat version.\nLeonard: Uh, that\xe2\x80\x99s my water.\nSheldon: What?\nLeonard: My water. You\xe2\x80\x99re drinking it.\nSheldon: Dear Lord! Have you been drinking it?\nLeonard: Yes. It\xe2\x80\x99s my water.\nSheldon: Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s it then. I\xe2\x80\x99m dead.\nLeonard: Here we go.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, do I really need to connect the dots for you? The backwash into this glass is every pathogen that calls your mouth home, sweet home. Not to mention the visitors who arrive on the dancing tongue of your subtropical girlfriend.\nRaj: Hey! That\xe2\x80\x99s my sister and my country you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about. Leonard may have defiled one, but I won\xe2\x80\x99t have you talking smack about the other.\nBernadette: You guys ready to order?\nSheldon: Yes, I\xe2\x80\x99d like a seven-day course of penicillin, some, uh, syrup of ipecac, to induce vomiting, and a mint.\nBernadette: I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand.\nHoward: He drank from Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s glass.\nSheldon: He drank from Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s glass. Words they\xe2\x80\x99ll be carving into my tombstone.\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99s actually my napkin.\nSheldon: Oh, this is a nightmare!\nHoward: Where are you going?\nSheldon: To the bar, to sterilize my mouth with alcohol. Gang way! Dead man walking!\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The same.\nBernadette: All right. Here you go. Two lemonades, one iced tea and a root beer for Priya.\nPriya: Is it diet?\nBernadette: That\xe2\x80\x99s what you ordered.\nPriya: Thank you. Hey, have you and Howard started planning your wedding yet?\nBernadette: Yeah. We\xe2\x80\x99re thinking of having it on a cliff overlooking the ocean.\nHoward: Nothing soothes those pre-wedding jitters like the thought of falling and drowning.\nLeonard: What did your mother say when you told her you were getting married?\nBernadette: He hasn\xe2\x80\x99t told her yet. He\xe2\x80\x99s waiting for the right time.\nHoward: I was thinking of weaving it into her eulogy.\nPriya: Howard, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to tell your mother.\nHoward: Hey, have you told your parents you\xe2\x80\x99re dating this short glass of skim milk here?\nPriya: Uh, that\xe2\x80\x99s different. First of all, we\xe2\x80\x99re not engaged, and second, Indian parents are very protective of their children.\nHoward: Right, right, whereas Jewish mothers take a casual, la-di-da approach to their sons.\nSheldon: I gargled with tequila and may have swallowed a teeny bit.\nLeonard: You all right?\nSheldon: Fine. Thank you for asking. I love you so much.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Fire demon.\nRaj: Ooh, fire demon. Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s turning up the heat.\nHoward: Troll master.\nRaj: Check it! Howard pulls one out from under the bridge. Nice!\nLeonard: Water nymph.\nRaj: Oh, yeah, she\xe2\x80\x99s got puddles in all the right places.\nSheldon: Could you please play the game without commenting on every card?\nRaj: Sorry. Walking tree.\nSheldon: Last one.\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99m taking a stroll and I\xe2\x80\x99m sporting wood.\nHoward (reading a text): Okay, the Eagle has landed.\nLeonard: What\xe2\x80\x99s going on?\nHoward: Bernadette and my mother are having a get-to-know-you lunch at the Old Town Deli.\nRaj: Oh, that sounds lovely.\nHoward: Hope so. Of course, if history is any indication, my mother will swallow her whole and spit out her bones like an owl.\nLeonard: Have you met Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s parents?\nHoward: You mean Adolf and Eva? Not yet. One goose step at a time.\nRaj: Sheldon, that\xe2\x80\x99s my water.\nSheldon: Oh, dear Lord!\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99s not your water.\nRaj: I know.\nSheldon: Where\xe2\x80\x99s the mouthwash?\nRaj (holding it): Where indeed.\nScene: Howard\xe2\x80\x99s house.\nHoward: Ma, I\xe2\x80\x99m home! Where are you?\nMrs Wolowitz (off): I\xe2\x80\x99m in the toilet.\nHoward: So, how\xe2\x80\x99d it go?\nMrs Wolowitz: Too soon to say. I\xe2\x80\x99m not done yet.\nHoward: No, I mean lunch, today, with Bernadette.\nMrs Wolowitz: Oh! I had a pastrami sandwich. She had eggplant lasagna. Like that\xe2\x80\x99s what a person orders in a Jewish deli.\nHoward: Besides food, did you get along? Did you talk?\nMrs Wolowitz: Oh, sure. Did you know she\xe2\x80\x99s going to school to become a microbiologist?\nHoward: No, she never mentioned it.\nMrs Wolowitz: I bet she did and you didn\xe2\x80\x99t listen.\nHoward: Yeah, that\xe2\x80\x99s probably it. So, what do you think? Do you like her? She\xe2\x80\x99s great, huh?\nMrs Wolowitz: She\xe2\x80\x99s a lovely girl. Cute as a button.\nHoward: That\xe2\x80\x99s good to hear, \xe2\x80\x99cause I\xe2\x80\x99ve got some news.\nMrs Wolowitz: I hope it\xe2\x80\x99s good news, because I\xe2\x80\x99ve got nothing but disappointment in here!\nHoward: Bernadette and I are getting married. Ma? You too busy bearing down? Ma? (crashing sound from in bathroom) Oh, my God, Ma? Ma? Ma? Stand back, I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna break the door down! (Runs at door. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t break down. Falls over.) Son of a bitch! Ma, help!\nScene: The laundry room.\nPenny: Hey.\nSheldon: Hello.\nPenny: Haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen you in a while. How\xe2\x80\x99s it going?\nSheldon: Oh, other than waiting out the exponential growth period of the virulent organisms trooping through my microvilli into my circulatory system, hunky-dory. (Penny laughs) Did I say something amusing?\nPenny: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, maybe, I have no idea what you said.\nSheldon: So your mirth is merely a discharge of nervous energy with no semantic content at all?\nPenny: My mirth. Classic.\nSheldon: Is there a station coming up where I can board your giggling train of thought?\nPenny: It\xe2\x80\x99s not a big deal, Sheldon. It\xe2\x80\x99s just, ever since Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s been dating Raj\xe2\x80\x99s sister, I\xe2\x80\x99ve had to keep my distance. I don\xe2\x80\x99t get to hear all your jibber-jabber.\nSheldon: Jibber-jabber? I don\xe2\x80\x99t jibber-jabber.\nPenny: What are you doing at work these days?\nSheldon: Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m working on time-dependent backgrounds in string theory, specifically quantum field theory in D-dimensional de Sitter space.\nPenny: Alright, come on, even you have to admit that\xe2\x80\x99s jibber-jabber.\nSheldon: Interesting, do you know where the phrase jibber-jabber comes from?\nPenny: Oh, my God, you\xe2\x80\x99re about to jibber-jabber about jibber-jabber.\nLeonard: Howard and his mother are at the hospital. Come on, we gotta go.\nPenny: Oh, my God! What happened?\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, I just got a text. Come on, hurry.\nPenny: Okay.\nLeonard: Sheldon, let\xe2\x80\x99s go!\nSheldon: To a hospital? Full of sick people? Oh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think so.\nPenny: Okay, well, your friend and his mother are there, we\xe2\x80\x99re going.\nSheldon: I can\xe2\x80\x99t.\nPenny: Oh, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell me you\xe2\x80\x99re afraid of germs.\nSheldon: Not all germs. Just the ones that will kill me. It\xe2\x80\x99s the same way I\xe2\x80\x99m not afraid of all steak knives, just the ones that might be plunged in my thorax.\nLeonard: Right, fine. I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell Howard you didn\xe2\x80\x99t come because you\xe2\x80\x99re more concerned about your own well-being than his.\nSheldon: I would think he would know that.\nPenny: Okay, you know what? You are unbelievable. You buy all these superhero T-shirts, but when it\xe2\x80\x99s time for you to step up and do the right thing, you just hide in the laundry room.\nSheldon: Fine, I\xe2\x80\x99ll go. Just for the record, my Aunt Ruth died in a hospital. She went in to visit my Uncle Roger, caught something and bit the dust a week later. The two of them now share a coffee can on my mother\xe2\x80\x99s mantel.\nScene: A hospital waiting room.\nHoward: So I knocked down the bathroom door, picked up my poor unconscious mother, carried her to the car, and drove like a madman to the emergency room.\nBernadette: You\xe2\x80\x99re a real hero, Howard.\nHoward: No, I did what any son would do.\nPenny: Hang on a second, you picked up your mother? Her own legs are barely able to do that.\nHoward: I was filled with adrenaline. It happens to be how women lift cars off babies.\nPenny: Yeah, I\xe2\x80\x99m saying, it\xe2\x80\x99d be easier to lift a car.\nHoward: What can I tell you? After I found the courage to put her pants back on, I was unstoppable.\nLeonard: So, how is she?\nHoward: They\xe2\x80\x99re running tests. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. It may have been a heart attack or heart-attack-like event.\nPenny: What\xe2\x80\x99s the difference?\nSheldon: A heart-attack-like event is an event that\xe2\x80\x99s like a heart attack.\nPenny: Thanks for clearing that up.\nSheldon: Regardless, coronary problems are eminently treatable. What\xe2\x80\x99s more likely going to kill Howard\xe2\x80\x99s mother are the antibiotic-resistant super-bugs festering in every nook and cranny of this hospital.\nPenny: Okay, you\xe2\x80\x99re not helping.\nSheldon: Disagree.\nLeonard: Go sit over there.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99ll sit over there, it looks cleaner.\nLeonard: Is there a history of heart disease in your family?\nHoward: My family is the history of heart disease. There\xe2\x80\x99s a cave painting in France of one of my ancestors doing this (clutches chest).\nBernadette: So it\xe2\x80\x99s probably genetic.\nHoward: Well, maybe. Mom also had just gotten some news that might have upset her.\nBernadette: What?\nHoward: It\xe2\x80\x99s not important.\nBernadette: Come on, Howard, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to be your wife. You can share anything with me.\nHoward: You\xe2\x80\x99d think that. But no.\nBernadette: You told her we were going to get married and she had a heart attack?\nHoward: You can\xe2\x80\x99t take that personally.\nPenny: How else is she supposed to take it?\nHoward: What you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to keep in mind is that ever since my dad left, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been the whole world to my mother. I mean, she\xe2\x80\x99d be threatened by any woman who can give me what she can\xe2\x80\x99t.\nBernadette: You mean sexual intercourse?\nHoward: Well, when you say it like that you make it sound creepy.\nPriya (arriving): What happened?\nBernadette: Howard\xe2\x80\x99s mother had a heart attack because I have sex with him and she can\xe2\x80\x99t.\nHoward: Bernie, wait!\nSheldon (to Raj): I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you $1,000 if you\xe2\x80\x99ll drive me home.\nScene: The same, later.\nPriya: Nice of you to come for Howard.\nPenny: Well, he\xe2\x80\x99s my friend. It\xe2\x80\x99s what you do. (Laughs)\nPriya: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, did I miss something?\nPenny: It\xe2\x80\x99s just so weird. Howard Wolowitz is my friend. You know, once he tried to stick his tongue down my throat and I broke his nose.\nPriya: That\xe2\x80\x99s a little easier to believe than he\xe2\x80\x99s your friend.\nPenny: Yeah, tell me about it.\nPriya: You know, my brother had a group of friends like this in India. They dressed up in leotards and goggles and called themselves the New Delhi Power Rangers.\nPenny: You mean when he was little.\nPriya: Not as little as you\xe2\x80\x99d want him to be.\nPenny: You know, this stuff is horrible. You want to see if we can find the cafeteria and get real coffee?\nPriya: Sure. We\xe2\x80\x99re going to the cafeteria to get some coffee. You want anything?\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m fine. That\xe2\x80\x99s nice that they\xe2\x80\x99re getting along.\nRaj: Your girlfriend and your ex-girlfriend are hanging out together? Oh, yeah, that can only be good for you.\nLeonard: What are you talking about?\nRaj: One of them broke up with you. Do you really want her telling the other one why?\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t care. I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything to hide.\nRaj: Good, good. Then you have nothing to worry about.\nLeonard: No, I do not. You are a mean little man.\nRaj: You\xe2\x80\x99d think it\xe2\x80\x99d be because my parents didn\xe2\x80\x99t love me, but actually they loved me a great deal.\nHoward: Bernie, it\xe2\x80\x99s not you. She\xe2\x80\x99s just set in her ways.\nBernadette: How can we be together if the thought of us getting married might kill your mother?\nHoward: It\xe2\x80\x99s the circle of life, sweetie. One day our son will marry someone and it will kill you.\nSheldon: Howard, I have to go to the bathroom and no one will take me home.\nHoward: What\xe2\x80\x99s wrong with the bathroom here?\nSheldon: Pneumococcus, streptococcus, staphylococcus and other assorted coccuses.\nHoward: Sheldon, my mother is on her deathbed and my fianc\xc3\xa9e is grief-stricken over putting her there. I\xe2\x80\x99m not taking you home.\nSheldon: Will you at least go with me to the restroom here, so you can open the door and flush the urinal?\nHoward: No!\nSheldon: This might be a good time to point out, Howard, that friendship requires a certain give and take. Hold the door!\nDoctor: Mr. Wolowitz?\nHoward: Is she okay?\nDoctor: It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a heart attack. She\xe2\x80\x99s awake, she\xe2\x80\x99s resting comfortably. We\xe2\x80\x99re still running a few tests.\nHoward: Can I see her?\nDoctor: Actually, she said, and I quote, she\xe2\x80\x99d like to see the little Catholic girl first.\nBernadette: Me? Why me?\nHoward: Jews have been asking that for centuries. There\xe2\x80\x99s no real good answer.\nBernadette: Okay, well, wish me luck.\nHoward: Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry, you\xe2\x80\x99ll be fine. Let\xe2\x80\x99s just hide Mr. Cross. If it touches her, it burns.\nDoctor: You brought a Catholic girl home to your mother?\nHoward: Yeah.\nDoctor: Why don\xe2\x80\x99t I write you a prescription for Xanax.\nScene: Outside the hospital washroom. A man enters. 339\nSheldon (exiting while the door is open): Finally. (Goes down corridor. Dodges into a door to avoid a coughing patient on a trolley. The room is full of doctors in hazmat suits.) Oh, what fresh hell is this?\nDoctor: Wait, you can\xe2\x80\x99t leave here, you\xe2\x80\x99ve been exposed.\nSheldon: No, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t. It\xe2\x80\x99s all good.\nScene: A hospital corridor.\nPenny: You want to talk about crazy mothers, Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s mom wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t give him any sort of approval growing up.\nPriya: Oh, the poor thing.\nPenny: It makes him desperate to please women. That\xe2\x80\x99s why the foreplay goes on and on.\nPriya: It does, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\nPenny: It\xe2\x80\x99s like he\xe2\x80\x99s trying to win a prize. A word of advice, don\xe2\x80\x99t doze off. You will never hear the end of it.\nSheldon (through glass door pane): Help me! Come back! Penny!\nScene: The waiting room.\nLeonard: There are a couple of things I did with Penny that might be a little silly, but\xe2\x80\xa6\nRaj: Like what?\nLeonard: Every once in a while, before we\xe2\x80\x99d go to bed, I\xe2\x80\x99d put on a little show for her.\nRaj: What do you mean, a show?\nLeonard: Well, you know, the way I took my clothes off.\nRaj: Like, to music?\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99d look pretty stupid if there was no music.\nRaj: So you\xe2\x80\x99d do a striptease?\nLeonard: I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t swinging around a pole.\nRaj: Good, good.\nLeonard: There was one time I put body glitter on.\nRaj: Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you have to worry about Penny telling my sister that.\nLeonard: No, she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t.\nRaj: Your big problem is me telling her.\nLeonard: You really are a mean little man.\nPriya: Oh, God, that\xe2\x80\x99s so true.\nPenny: Yeah, I know, right?\nLeonard: Hey, what took you guys so long?\nPriya: Oh, we were just chatting.\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99s nice. What about?\nPenny: We were just comparing notes about how you are in the sack.\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99s funny.\nPenny: Yeah.\nRaj: What if she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t kidding?\nLeonard: It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter. I\xe2\x80\x99m the king of foreplay.\nHoward: Hey, how\xe2\x80\x99d it go?\nBernadette: You\xe2\x80\x99re a putz. You know what that means?\nHoward: Yeah. Do you?\nBernadette: Your mother just taught it to me. She thinks she got food poisoning from that deli and she just wanted to make sure I was okay.\nHoward: And are you?\nBernadette: No, because I\xe2\x80\x99m engaged to a putz. You let me believe I was the reason she had a heart attack.\nHoward: Well, based on the available evid\xe2\x80\xa6\nBernadette: Shut up! She said I\xe2\x80\x99m a wonderful girl and that you\xe2\x80\x99re lucky to have me.\nHoward: Where are you going?\nBermadette (in a voice like Mrs Wolowitz): To the toilet! Is that okay with you?\nHoward: Is it just me, or does she sound sexy when she\xe2\x80\x99s angry?\nScene: A hospital room. The guys except for Sheldon are in Hazmat suits.\nSheldon: Mountain Elf.\nRaj: He takes the elf from off the shelf.\nLeonard: Hell Hounds.\nRaj: Hell Hounds. Who let the Satanic dogs out? Who? Who-who?\nHoward: Colossal Serpent.\nRaj: I got a colossal serpent right here.\nSheldon: Must you?\nRaj: Sorry, I\xe2\x80\x99m just trying to cheer my buddy up. Rotting Zombie. Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s new Facebook photo.\nSheldon: Zandor, Wizard of the North. Ha! I win.\nHoward: If you skip the part about being under a two-week quarantine because you were exposed to a deadly disease, absolutely.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
