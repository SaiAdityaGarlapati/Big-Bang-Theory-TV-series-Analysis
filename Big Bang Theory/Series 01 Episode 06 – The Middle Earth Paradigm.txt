b'Scene: Lobby of the apartment building, Howard, Raj, Sheldon and Leonard enter in combat gear, covered in blue paint.\nRaj: Okay, if no-one else will say it, I will. We really suck at paintball.\nHoward: That was absolutely humiliating.\nLeonard: Oh, come on, some battles you win, some battles you lose.\nHoward: Yes, but you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to lose to Kyle Bernstein\xe2\x80\x99s Bar-Mitzvah party.\nLeonard: I think we have to acknowledge, those were some fairly savage pre-adolescent Jews.\nSheldon: You know, we were annihilated by our own incompetence and the inability of some people to follow the chain of command.\nLeonard: Sheldon, let it go.\nSheldon: No, I want to talk about the fact that Wolowitz shot me in the back.\nHoward: I shot you for good reason, you were leading us into disaster.\nSheldon: I was giving clear, concise orders.\nLeonard: You hid behind a tree yelling \xe2\x80\x9cget the kid in the yarmulkah, get the kid in the yarmulkah.\xe2\x80\x9d\nPenny (arriving): Oh, hey guys.\nLeonard: Hello Penny.\nHoward: Morning ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\nPenny: So, how was paintball, did you have fun?\nSheldon: Sure, if you consider being fragged by your own troops fun. (To Howard) You clear space on your calendar, there will be an enquiry.\nPenny: Okay, um, oh hey, I\xe2\x80\x99m having a party on Saturday so if you guys are around you should come by.\nLeonard: A party?\nPenny: Yeah.\nHoward: A boy-girl party?\nPenny: Well, there will be boys, and there will be girls, and it is a party. So, it\xe2\x80\x99ll just be a bunch of my friends, we\xe2\x80\x99ll have some beer, do a little dancing\xe2\x80\xa6\nSheldon: Dancing?\nLeonard: Yeah, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, Penny\xe2\x80\xa6\nSheldon: The thing is, we\xe2\x80\x99re not\xe2\x80\xa6.\nLeonard: We\xe2\x80\x99re really more\xe2\x80\xa6.\nSheldon: No.\nLeonard: But thanks, thanks for thinking of us.\nPenny: Are you sure? Come on, it\xe2\x80\x99s Halloween.\nSheldon: A Halloween party?\nHoward: As in, costumes?\nPenny: Well, yeah.\nLeonard: Is there a theme?\nPenny: Um, yeah, Halloween.\nSheldon: Yes, but are the costumes random, or genre specific?\nPenny: As usual, I\xe2\x80\x99m not following.\nLeonard: He\xe2\x80\x99s asking if we can come as anyone from science-fiction, fantasy\xe2\x80\xa6\nPenny: Sure.\nSheldon: What about comic-books?\nPenny: Fine.\nSheldon: Anime?\nPenny: Of course.\nSheldon: TV , film, D&D, Manga, Greek Gods, Roman Gods, Norse Gods\xe2\x80\xa6\nPenny: Anything you want, okay? Any costume you want. Bye.\nHoward: Gentlemen, to the sewing machines.\nCredits Sequence\nScene: The apartment living room. There is a knock on the door.\nLeonard (off): I\xe2\x80\x99ll get it. (He enters, wearing a Flash costume. Opens door.)\nHoward (Entering at speed, also wearing a Flash costume): Bjow (They stare at each other in shock.)\nLeonard: Oh, no.\nSheldon: Oh no! (He is also wearing a Flash costume.)\nRaj: Make way for the fastest man alive. (Enters, also in a Flash costume.) Oh no!\nSheldon: See, this is why I wanted to have a costume meeting.\nLeonard: We all have other costumes, we can change.\nRaj: Or, we could walk right behind each other all night and look like one person going really fast.\nHoward: No, no, no, it\xe2\x80\x99s a boy-girl party, this Flash runs solo.\nLeonard: Okay, how about this, nobody gets to be The Flash, we all change, agreed?\nAll: Agreed.\nLeonard: I call Frodo!\nAll: Damn!\nScene: The same, later. Leonard is dressed as Frodo. Howard appears to be Peter Pan. There is a knock on the door.\nRaj (Entering dressed as Thor): Hey. Sorry I\xe2\x80\x99m late, but my hammer got stuck in the door on the bus.\nLeonard: You went with Thor?\nRaj: What? Just because I\xe2\x80\x99m Indian I can\xe2\x80\x99t be a Norse God? No, no, no, Raj has to be an Indian God. That\xe2\x80\x99s racism. I mean, look at Wolowitz, he\xe2\x80\x99s not English, but he\xe2\x80\x99s dressed like Peter Pan. Sheldon(entering in a body suit featuring black and white vertical lines) is neither sound nor light, but he\xe2\x80\x99s obviously the Doppler Effect.\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m not Peter Pan, I\xe2\x80\x99m Robin Hood.\nRaj: Really, because I saw Peter Pan, and you\xe2\x80\x99re dressed exactly like Cathy Rigby. She was a little bigger than you, but it\xe2\x80\x99s basically the same look, man.\nLeonard: Hey, Sheldon, there\xe2\x80\x99s something I want to talk to you about before we go to the party.\nSheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t care if anybody gets it, I\xe2\x80\x99m going as the Doppler Effect.\nLeonard: No, it\xe2\x80\x99s not\xe2\x80\xa6\nSheldon: If I have to, I can demonstrate. Neeeeoooowwwww!\nLeonard: Terrific. Um, this party is my first chance for Penny to see me in the context of her social group, and I need you not to embarrass me tonight.\nSheldon: Well, what exactly do you mean by embarrass you?\nLeonard: For example, tonight no-one needs to know that my middle name is Leakey.\nSheldon: Well, there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing embarrassing about that, your father worked with Lewis Leakey, a great anthropologist. It had nothing to do with your bed-wetting.\nLeonard: All I\xe2\x80\x99m saying is that this party is the perfect opportunity for Penny to see me as a member of her peer group. A potential close friend and\xe2\x80\xa6 perhaps more. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to look like a dork.\nScene: The hallway. Howard knocks on Penny\xe2\x80\x99s door with his bow.\nHoward: Just a heads up fellas, if anyone gets lucky I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a dozen condoms in my quiver.\nPenny (opening door, not in costume): Oh, hey guys.\nLeonard: Hey, sorry we\xe2\x80\x99re late.\nPenny: Late? It\xe2\x80\x99s 7:05.\nSheldon: And you said the party starts at seven.\nPenny: Well, yeah, when you start a party at seven, no-one shows up at, you know, seven.\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s 7:05.\nPenny: Yes. Yes it is. Okay, well, um, come on in.\nHoward: What, are all the girls in the bathroom?\nPenny: Probably, but in their own homes.\nSheldon: So what time does the costume parade start?\nPenny: The parade?\nSheldon: Yeah, so the judges can give out the prizes for best costume, you know, most frightening, most authentic, most accurate visual representation of a scientific principle.\nPenny: Oh, Sheldon, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry but there aren\xe2\x80\x99t going to be any parades or judges or prizes.\nSheldon: This party is just going to suck.\nPenny: No, come on, it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be fun, and you all look great, I mean, look at you, Thor, and, oh, Peter Pan, that\xe2\x80\x99s so cute.\nLeonard: Actually, Penny, he\xe2\x80\x99s Rob\xe2\x80\xa6\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m Peter Pan! And I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a handful of pixie dust with your name on it.\nPenny: No you don\xe2\x80\x99t. Oh, hey, what\xe2\x80\x99s Sheldon supposed to be.\nLeonard: Oh, he\xe2\x80\x99s the Doppler Effect.\nSheldon: Yes. It\xe2\x80\x99s the apparent change in the frequency of a wave caused by relative motion between the source of the wave and the observer.\nPenny: Oh, sure, I see it now, the Doppler Effect. Alright, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to shower, you guys um, make yourselves comfortable.\nLeonard: Okay.\nSheldon: See, people get it.\nTime shift, the party is in full swing, the four guys are sitting together around the coffee table.\nRaj: Mmmm, by Odin\xe2\x80\x99s beard, this is good Chex Mix.\nHoward: No thanks, peanuts, I can\xe2\x80\x99t afford to swell up in these tights.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m confused. If there\xe2\x80\x99s no costume parade, what are we doing here?\nLeonard: We\xe2\x80\x99re socialising. Meeting new people.\nSheldon: Telepathically?\nPenny (crossing the room in a cat costume, speaking to someone off-screen): Oh hey, when did you get here, Hi!\nRaj: Penny is wearing the worst Catwoman costume I have ever seen, and that includes Halle Berry\xe2\x80\x99s.\nLeonard: She\xe2\x80\x99s not Catwoman, she\xe2\x80\x99s just a generic cat.\nSheldon: And that\xe2\x80\x99s the kind of sloppy costuming which results from a lack of rules and competition.\nHoward: Hey guys, check out the sexy nurse. I believe it\xe2\x80\x99s time for me to turn my head and cough.\nRaj: What is your move?\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m going to use the mirror technique. She brushes her hair back, I brush my hair back, she shrugs, I shrug, subconsciously she\xe2\x80\x99s thinking we\xe2\x80\x99re in sync, we belong together.\nLeonard: Where do you get this stuff?\nHoward: You know, psychology journals, internet research, and there\xe2\x80\x99s this great show on VH1 about how to pick up girls.\nRaj: Oh, if only I had his confidence. I have such difficulty speaking to women. Or around women. Or at times, even effeminate men.\nHoward: If that\xe2\x80\x99s a working stethoscope, maybe you\xe2\x80\x99d like to hear my heart skip a beat.\nNurse Costume Girl: No thanks.\nHoward: No, seriously, you can, I have transient idiopathic arrhythmia.\nLeonard: I  want to get to know Penny\xe2\x80\x99s friends, I just, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how to talk to these people.\nSheldon: Well, I actually might be able to help.\nLeonard: How so?\nSheldon: Like Jane Goodall observing the apes, I initially saw their interactions as confusing and unstructured, but patterns emerge, they have their own language if you will.\nLeonard: Go on.\nSheldon: Well, it seems that the newcomer approaches the existing group with the greeting \xe2\x80\x9cHow wasted am I?\xe2\x80\x9d which is met with an approving chorus of \xe2\x80\x9cDude.\xe2\x80\x9d\nLeonard: Then what happens?\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s as far as I\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten.\nLeonard: This is ridiculous, I\xe2\x80\x99m jumping in.\nSheldon: Good luck.\nLeonard: No, you\xe2\x80\x99re coming with me.\nSheldon: Oh, I hardly think so.\nLeonard: Come on.\nSheldon: Aren\xe2\x80\x99t you afraid I\xe2\x80\x99ll embarrass you?\nLeonard: Yes. But I need a wing-man.\nSheldon: Alright, but if we\xe2\x80\x99re going to use flight metaphors I\xe2\x80\x99m much more suited to being the guy from the FAA, analysing wreckage.\nGirl in Hippie Costume: Oh, Hi!\nLeonard: Hi.\nSheldon: Hello.\nGirl: So, what are you supposed to be?\nSheldon: Me? I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you a hint. Neeeeooooowwwww!\nGirl: Uh, a choo-choo train?\nSheldon: Close! Neeeeeoooooowwwww!\nGirl: A brain damaged choo-choo train?\nGirl in Butterfly Costume (dropping onto sofa next to Raj): How wasted am I? (Raj shrugs.)\nTime shift. Sheldon and Leonard are now talking to a girl in a princess costume.\nSheldon: Neeeeeooooowwwwww!\nGirl: I still don\xe2\x80\x99t get it.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m the Doppler Effect.\nGirl: Okay, if that is some sort of learning disability, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s very insensitive.\nLeonard: Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you just tell people you\xe2\x80\x99re a zebra?\n Sheldon: Well, why don\xe2\x80\x99t you just tell people you\xe2\x80\x99re one of the seven dwarves.\nLeonard: Because I\xe2\x80\x99m Frodo.\nSheldon: Yes, well, I\xe2\x80\x99m the Doppler Effect.\nLeonard: Oh no.\nSheldon: What?\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99s Penny\xe2\x80\x99s ex-boyfriend.\nSheldon: What do you suppose he\xe2\x80\x99s doing here? Besides disrupting the local gravity field.\nLeonard: If he were any bigger, he\xe2\x80\x99d have moons orbiting him.\nSheldon: Oh, snap. So I guess we\xe2\x80\x99ll be leaving now.\nLeonard: Why should we leave? For all we know, he crashed the party and Penny doesn\xe2\x80\x99t even want him here. (Penny and Kurt hug).\nSheldon: You have a back-up hypothesis.\nLeonard: Maybe they just want to be friends.\nSheldon: Or maybe she wants to be friends, and he wants something more.\nLeonard: Then he and I are on equal ground.\nSheldon: Yes, but you\xe2\x80\x99re much closer to it than he is.\nLeonard: Look, if this was 15,000 years ago, by virtue of his size and strength, Kurt would be entitled to his choice of female partners.\nSheldon: And male partners. Animal partners. Large primordial eggplants, pretty much whatever tickled his fancy.\nLeonard: Yes, but our society has undergone a paradigm shift, in the information age, Sheldon, you and I are the alpha males. We shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have to back down.\nSheldon: True. Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you text him that and see if he backs down?\nLeonard: No. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to assert my dominance face to face.\nSheldon: Face to face? Are you going to wait for him to sit down, or are you going to stand on a coffee table?\nLeonard: Hello Penny. Hello Kurt.\nPenny: Oh, hey guys. You having a good time?\nSheldon: Given the reaction to my costume, this party is a scathing indictment of the American education system.\nKurt: What, you\xe2\x80\x99re a zebra, right?\nSheldon: Yet another child left behind.\nKurt: And what are you supposed to be, an Elf?\nLeonard: No, I\xe2\x80\x99m a Hobbit.\nKurt: What\xe2\x80\x99s the difference?\nLeonard: Uh, a Hobbit is a mortal Halfling inhabitant of Middle Earth, whereas an Elf is an immortal tall warrior.\nKurt: So why the hell would you want to be a Hobbit?\nSheldon: Because he is neither tall nor immortal, and none of us could be The Flash.\nKurt: Well, whatever, why don\xe2\x80\x99t you go hop off on a quest, I\xe2\x80\x99m talking to Penny here.\nLeonard: I think we\xe2\x80\x99re all talking to Penny here.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m not. No offence.\nKurt: Okay, maybe you didn\xe2\x80\x99t hear me, go away.\nPenny: Alright Kurt, be nice.\nKurt: Aw, I am being nice. Right little buddy.\nPenny: Kurt!\nLeonard: Okay, I understand your impulse to try to physically intimidate me. I mean, you can\xe2\x80\x99t compete with me on an intellectual level and so you\xe2\x80\x99re driven to animalistic puffery.\nKurt: Are you calling me a puffy animal?\nPenny: Of course not, no, he\xe2\x80\x99s not, you\xe2\x80\x99re not, right Leonard?\nLeonard: No, I said animalistic. Of course we\xe2\x80\x99re all animals, but some of us have climbed a little higher on the evolutionary tree.\nSheldon: If he understands that, you\xe2\x80\x99re in trouble.\nKurt: So what, I\xe2\x80\x99m unevolved?\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re in trouble.\nKurt: You know, you use a lot of big words for such a little dwarf.\nPenny: Okay, Kurt, please.\nLeonard: No, Penny, it\xe2\x80\x99s okay, I can handle this. I\xe2\x80\x99m not a dwarf, I\xe2\x80\x99m a Hobbit. A Hobbit. Are misfiring neurons in your hippocampus preventing the conversion from short-term to long-term memory?\nKurt: Okay, now you\xe2\x80\x99re starting to make me mad.\nLeonard: A homo-habilus discovering his opposable thumbs says what?\nKurt: What?\nLeonard: I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve made my point.\nKurt: Yeah, how about I make a point out of your pointy little head.\nSheldon: Let me remind you, while my moral support is absolute, in a physical confrontation I will be less than useless.\nLeonard: There\xe2\x80\x99s not going to be a confrontation, in fact I doubt if he can even spell confrontation.\nKurt (physically lifting Leonard from the ground): C \xe2\x80\x93 O \xe2\x80\x93 N\xe2\x80\xa6 frontation!\nPenny: Kurt, put him down this instant.\nKurt: He started it.\nPenny: I don\xe2\x80\x99t care, I\xe2\x80\x99m finishing it, put him down.\nKurt: Fine. You\xe2\x80\x99re one lucky little leprechaun.\nSheldon: He\xe2\x80\x99s a Hobbit! I\xe2\x80\x99ve got your back.\nPenny: Leonard, are you okay.\nLeonard: Yeah, no, I\xe2\x80\x99m fine. It\xe2\x80\x99s good, it\xe2\x80\x99s a good party, thanks for having us, it\xe2\x80\x99s just getting a little late so\xe2\x80\xa6.\nPenny: Oh, okay, alright, well thank you for coming.\nSheldon: Happy Halloween. (They leave) If it\xe2\x80\x99s any consolation, I thought that homo-habilus line really put him in his place.\nScene: The living room. Sheldon brings Leonard a cup of tea.\nLeonard: What\xe2\x80\x99s that?\nSheldon: Tea. When people are upset the cultural convention is to bring them hot beverages. There there. You want to talk about it?\nLeonard: No.\nSheldon: Good. There there was really all I had.\nLeonard: Good night Sheldon.\nSheldon: Good night Leonard.\nPenny (knocking on door and entering): Hey Leonard.\nLeonard: Hi Penny.\nPenny: Hey, I just wanted to make sure you\xe2\x80\x99re okay.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m fine.\nPenny: I\xe2\x80\x99m so sorry about what happened.\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s not your fault.\nPenny: Yes it is. That\xe2\x80\x99s why I broke up with him, he always does stuff like that.\nLeonard: So why was he at your party?\nPenny: Well, I ran into him last week and, he was\xe2\x80\xa6  just, all apologetic, about how he\xe2\x80\x99s changed, he was just going on and on and I believed him, and I\xe2\x80\x99m an idiot because I always believe guys like that and\xe2\x80\xa6 I can\xe2\x80\x99t go back to my party because he\xe2\x80\x99s there, and I know you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to hear this and I\xe2\x80\x99m upset and I\xe2\x80\x99m really drunk and I just want to\xe2\x80\xa6 (bursts into tears and rests head on Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder.)\nLeonard: There there.\nPenny: God, what is wrong with me.\nLeonard: Nothing, you\xe2\x80\x99re perfect.\nPenny: Gah, I\xe2\x80\x99m not perfect.\nLeonard: Yes you are.\nPenny: You really think so, don\xe2\x80\x99t you? (She kisses hm.)\nLeonard: Penny?\nPenny: Yeah.\nLeonard: How much have you had to drink tonight?\nPenny: Just\xe2\x80\xa6. a lot.\nLeonard: Are you sure that your being drunk, and your being angry with Kurt doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have something to do with what\xe2\x80\x99s going on here?\nPenny: It might. Boy, you\xe2\x80\x99re really smart.\nLeonard: Yeah, I\xe2\x80\x99m a frickin\xe2\x80\x99 genius.\nPenny: Leonard, you are so great. Why can\xe2\x80\x99t all guys be like you?\nLeonard: Because if all guys were like me, the human race couldn\xe2\x80\x99t survive.\nPenny: I should probably go.\nLeonard: Probably.\nPenny (in doorway): Thank you. (She kisses him again. Kurt is watching.)\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99s right, you saw what you saw. That\xe2\x80\x99s how we roll in The Shire. (Closes door quickly, locks and chains it.)\nScene: The apartment, there is a knock on the door.\nSheldon: Coming. (Opens door to Howard.)\nHoward: Hey, have you seen Koothrapali?\nSheldon: He\xe2\x80\x99s not here. Maybe the Avenger summoned him.\nHoward: He\xe2\x80\x99s not the Marvel comic story, he\xe2\x80\x99s the original Norse God.\nSheldon: Thank you for the clarification.\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m supposed to give him a ride home.\nSheldon: Well I\xe2\x80\x99m sure he\xe2\x80\x99ll be fine. He has his hammer.\nScene: A random bedroom. Butterfly costume girl is climbing off of Raj.\nButterfly Girl: Wow, I have to say, you are an amazing man. You\xe2\x80\x99re gentle and passionate, and my God, you are such a good listener!\n(Raj puts hands behind head with a smug expression on his face.)\nAdvertisements'
