b'Scene: The apartment.\nSheldon: All right, I\xe2\x80\x99m ready for my next question.\nAmy: In a world where rhinoceroses are domesticated pets, who wins the Second World War?\nSheldon: Uganda.\nAmy: Defend.\nSheldon: Kenya rises to power on the export of rhinoceroses. A Central African power block is formed, colonizing North Africa and Europe. When war breaks out, no one can afford the luxury of a rhino. Kenya withers, Uganda triumphs.\nAmy: Correct. My turn.\nSheldon: In a world where a piano is a weapon, not a musical instrument, on what does Scott Joplin play The Maple Leaf Rag?\nAmy: Tuned bayonets.\nSheldon: Defend.\nAmy: Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it obvious?\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re right. My apologies.\nLeonard: What the hell are you guys playing?\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s a game we invented. It\xe2\x80\x99s called Counterfactuals.\nAmy: We postulate an alternate world that differs from ours in one key aspect and then pose questions to each other.\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s fun for ages eight to eighty. Join us.\nLeonard: All right. I like a good brainteaser. Give it a whirl.\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re in luck, this is an easy one. In a world where mankind is ruled by a giant intelligent beaver, what food is no longer consumed?\nLeonard: Uh, a BLT where the B stands for beaver? I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\nSheldon: Leonard, be serious. We\xe2\x80\x99re playing a game here.\nLeonard: I can figure this out, let\xe2\x80\x99s see. Um, well, beavers eat tree bark. The only tree bark I know that humans consume is cinnamon. So, I\xe2\x80\x99ll say cinnamon.\nSheldon: Incorrect. Obviously, the answer is cheese Danish.\nLeonard: What?\nAmy: In a world ruled by a giant beaver, mankind builds many dams to please the beaver overlord. The low-lying city of Copenhagen is flooded. Thousands die. Devastated, the Danes never invent their namesake pastry. How does one miss that?\nLeonard: This is ridiculous. You\xe2\x80\x99re just making stuff up.\nAmy: Is he always like this when he loses?\nSheldon: Oh, yes. You should\xe2\x80\x99ve been here for the great Jenga tantrum of 2008.\nLeonard: You bumped the table and you know it.\nAmy: Perhaps it would be kinder to play a game more suited to his abilities. We\xe2\x80\x99ll close our eyes and count to ten while you hide.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m going to my room.\nAmy: Very good, Leonard. But next time, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell us where you\xe2\x80\x99re hiding.\nCredits sequence.\n  Scene: The Cheesecake Factory\nLeonard: Did you guys see the paper in The American Physics Journal on supersolids? It\xe2\x80\x99s pretty interesting. This guy\xe2\x80\x99s working from a hypothesis where\xe2\x80\xa6\nRaj: Spoiler alert! Spoiler alert.\nLeonard: What?\nRaj: Don\xe2\x80\x99t ruin it for me, man. I printed out a PDF to read on the potty.\nHoward: On the potty? What are you, five?\nRaj: It\xe2\x80\x99s a potty. What do you call it?\nHoward: Toilet.\nRaj: That\xe2\x80\x99s a little vulgar for the dinner table, don\xe2\x80\x99t you think?\nHoward: Oh, and potty is okay?\nRaj: Potty is innocent. Potty is adorable.\nHoward: What do you do in the potty, wee-wee?\nRaj: If I don\xe2\x80\x99t have to boom-boom.\nSheldon: Greetings. You all remember Amy Farrah Fowler.\nLeonard: Sure.\nHoward: Nice to see you.\nAmy: Hello.\nSheldon: Sorry we\xe2\x80\x99re late.\nAmy: I must take responsibility. I had to stop for feminine hygiene supplies.\nHoward: Ah, ah.\nLeonard: Okay.\nSheldon: I believe she\xe2\x80\x99s experiencing her menses.\nAmy: Actually, I\xe2\x80\x99m not. In order to avoid surprises, I wear them all the time.\nLeonard: Ah, ah.\nHoward: Okay. Toilet\xe2\x80\x99s sounding pretty good now, huh?\nPenny: Hey, look, it\xe2\x80\x99s Shamy.\nAmy: Shamy?\nSheldon: A juvenile amalgamation of our names. Sheldon and Amy,  Shamy.\nAmy: Oh. I don\xe2\x80\x99t like that. Don\xe2\x80\x99t do that.\nPenny: All righty. What\xe2\x80\x99s new?\nAmy: Well, just recently, I learned that you refer to us as Shamy, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t like that.\nPenny: I got it. But what I was going for was, you know, how\xe2\x80\x99s your life?\nAmy: Like everybody else\xe2\x80\x99s. Subject to entropy, decay and eventual death. Thank you for asking. Why is she not taking our order?\nSheldon: I should\xe2\x80\x99ve warned you, one has to navigate a labyrinth of social nonsense before one can be fed here.\nAmy: Really? I assumed an establishment called the Cheesecake Factory would function more efficiently.\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s how they lure you in. I believe it\xe2\x80\x99s called bait and switch.\nPenny: Okay, I\xe2\x80\x99m just gonna walk away, \xe2\x80\x99cause I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be here.\nLeonard: So, this is nice. First time we\xe2\x80\x99ve all gotten together to eat.\nAmy: You\xe2\x80\x99re right, he\xe2\x80\x99s a festival of humdrum chitchat.\nLeonard: Okay, that\xe2\x80\x99s all I got. Howard, you\xe2\x80\x99re up.\nHoward: Um, tell us about your work, Amy.\nAmy: I doubt you\xe2\x80\x99d understand. Sheldon tells me you only have a master\xe2\x80\x99s degree.\nHoward: Raj, do you have any questions for Amy?\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99m curious as to why we\xe2\x80\x99re not eating alone.\nSheldon: They can\xe2\x80\x99t function without me. I\xe2\x80\x99m the social glue that holds this little group together. You\xe2\x80\x99re welcome.\nScene: The stairwell.\n  Leonard: Listen, can I talk to you about your girlfriend?\nSheldon: She\xe2\x80\x99s not my girlfriend. She\xe2\x80\x99s a girl and she\xe2\x80\x99s my friend, but there\xe2\x80\x99s no touching or unsanitary exchange of saliva.\nLeonard: Got it.\nSheldon: Although, for the record, on one occasion, she licked her thumb to remove raspberry jelly from the corner of my mouth. It\xe2\x80\x99s an action we both regret to this day.\nLeonard: Uh-huh. Anyway, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure she\xe2\x80\x99s the best fit for our little, how should we call it, rebel alliance.\nSheldon: Oh, I never identified with the rebel alliance. Despite their tendency to build Death Stars, I\xe2\x80\x99ve always been more of an empire man.\nLeonard: Yeah, not my point.\nSheldon: I know what your point is. You\xe2\x80\x99re intimidated by Amy\xe2\x80\x99s intellect. To that I say, buck up.\nLeonard: Okay, let me just get right to it. Amy is judgmental, sanctimonious and frankly just obnoxious.\nSheldon: So?\nLeonard: So we already have you for all that.\nSheldon: Are you suggesting I terminate my relationship with Amy?\nLeonard: No, no, of course not. Just have your relationship someplace else.\nSheldon: May I point out that for eight long months, I suffered in silence as your female companion filled our apartment with her off-key country music caterwauling, the unappetizing spectacle of her grinding a pumice stone against her calloused feet in our living room, and night after night of uninformative TV documentaries about the Jersey Shore.\nLeonard: Suffered in silence?\nSheldon: Yes. And I\xe2\x80\x99d thank you to do the same.\nLeonard: Really? Silence?\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nRaj: Ah. Nothing makes beer taste better than cool clear Rocky Mountain spring water. Where are the Rocky Mountains, anyway?\nHoward: Philadelphia.\nRaj: Really? I thought they were out West someplace.\nHoward: Think about it, Raj. Where did the movie Rocky take place?\nRaj: Philadelphia. Okay, now I get it.\nPenny: So this is the plan? From now on, we\xe2\x80\x99re just gonna hide out in here to avoid the Shamy?\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99m very comfortable here. Penny, dear, why don\xe2\x80\x99t you shoot another silver bullet my way?\nPenny: Get one yourself.\nRaj: Ooh, somebody\xe2\x80\x99s been taking bitchy pills.\nPenny: God, he\xe2\x80\x99s an ass when he drinks.\nHoward: Oh, he\xe2\x80\x99s an ass when he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t. You just don\xe2\x80\x99t hear it.\nLeonard: I think we need to start entertaining the possibility that the Shamy could go on for years.\nRaj: Well, if that\xe2\x80\x99s the case, Penny will have to get satellite TV and maybe once a week run a vacuum through this place.\nPenny: I thought you were going to talk to Sheldon.\nLeonard: I did.\nPenny: Well, what\xe2\x80\x99d he say?\nLeonard: Well, he pointed out that he kinda, sorta had to put up with you.\nPenny: Kinda, sorta had to?\nLeonard: I didn\xe2\x80\x99t agree with him.\nPenny: Well, you defended me, right?\nLeonard: I tried, but (Penny starts rubbing her foot with a pumice stone) he made a fairly well-reasoned argument.\nHoward: You\xe2\x80\x99re not doing that right.\nPenny: What?\nHoward: Gimme.\nPenny: No.\nHoward: Trust me.\nPenny: No!\nHoward: I do this for my mom all the time. See? With the grain.\nPenny: Wow, that is better.\nHoward: And someday, when you have varicose veins, I\xe2\x80\x99ll show you how to massage them.\nScene: The University Cafeteria.\nRaj: Oh, God, never again.\nLeonard: I assume by never again, you mean never again will you drink all of Penny\xe2\x80\x99s beer, then run down to the gas station for a couple of 40s, a box of Slim Jims and the latest issue of Bombay Badonkadonks.\nRaj: I was homesick.\nHoward: The highlight of the evening was when you showed us your Bollywood break dancing skills. (Does a stereotyped impersonation of Bollywood dancing.)\nRaj: That\xe2\x80\x99s very offensive.\nHoward: Yeah, we all thought so.\nLeonard: Oh, no.\nHoward: What?\nLeonard: John and Yoko.\nHoward: More like Yoko and Yoko.\nSheldon: Greetings.\nLeonard: Hey.\nSheldon: I brought Amy here to show her some of the work I\xe2\x80\x99m doing.\nAmy: It\xe2\x80\x99s very impressive, for theoretical work.\nSheldon: Do I detect a hint of condescension?\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, was I being too subtle? I meant compared to the real-world applications of neurobiology, theoretical physics is, what\xe2\x80\x99s the word I\xe2\x80\x99m looking for? Hmm, cute.\nLeonard and Howard together: Oooh!\nSheldon: Are you suggesting the work of a neurobiologist like Babinski could ever rise to the significance of a physicist like Clarke-Maxwell or Dirac?\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99m stating it outright. Babinski eats Dirac for breakfast and defecates Clarke-Maxwell.\nSheldon: You take that back.\nAmy: Absolutely not. My colleagues and I are mapping the neurological substrates that subserve global information processing, which is required for all cognitive reasoning, including scientific inquiry, making my research ipso facto prior in the ordo cognoscendi. That means it\xe2\x80\x99s better than his research, and by extension, of course, yours.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, I\xe2\x80\x99m-I\xe2\x80\x99m still trying to work on the defecating Clark Maxwell, so\xe2\x80\xa6\nSheldon: Excuse me, but a grand unified theory, insofar as it explains everything, will ipso facto explain neurobiology.\nAmy: Yes, but if I\xe2\x80\x99m successful, I will be able to map and reproduce your thought processes in deriving a grand unified theory, and therefore, subsume your conclusions under my paradigm.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s the rankest psychologism, and was conclusively revealed as hogwash by Gottlob Frege in the 1890s!\nAmy: We appear to have reached an impasse.\nSheldon: I agree. I move our relationship terminate immediately.\nAmy: Seconded.\nSheldon: There being no objections\xe2\x80\xa6\nAll: No, uh-uh.\nSheldon: The motion carries. Good day, Amy Farrah Fowler.\nAmy: Good day, Sheldon Cooper.\nHoward: Women, huh? Can\xe2\x80\x99t live with them, can\xe2\x80\x99t successfully refute their hypotheses.\nSheldon: Amen to that.\nScene: The laundry room.\nPenny: Hey, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Hello.\nPenny: I hear you broke up with Amy.\nSheldon: A breakup would imply she was my girlfriend. She was a girl who was my friend who is now a girl who is not my friend.\nPenny: Wow. That\xe2\x80\x99s like the worst country song ever. So, how are you doing?\nSheldon: Regarding what?\nPenny: Amy.\nSheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t follow.\nPenny: Well, breakups, or whatever the hell this is, can be tough.\nSheldon: Penny, I assure you, I\xe2\x80\x99m fine. My relationship with Amy was purely intellectual. There were no emotional bonds, the severing of which would cause me any discomfort. The relationship simply outlived its utility, and I\xe2\x80\x99m continuing on with my life as before.\nPenny: Okay. Good.\nSheldon: Now, if you\xe2\x80\x99ll excuse me, I\xe2\x80\x99m off to buy a pussycat.\nScene: The cafeteria.\nLeonard: I gotta tell you guys, I\xe2\x80\x99m a little worried about Sheldon.\nHoward: We\xe2\x80\x99re all a little worried about Sheldon.\nLeonard: No, I mean since the Shamy hit a reef.\nHoward: Oh, I thought you were just making a generalization, you know, I\xe2\x80\x99m worried about Sheldon someday setting off a low-yield nuclear device because the cafeteria ran out of lime Jell-O.\nRaj: What does hit a reef mean?\nLeonard: Uh, went splitsville.\nRaj: Pardon?\nLeonard: Turned to boom-boom.\nRaj: Ah.\nLeonard: I think Sheldon really misses Amy.\nHoward: You should lend him your copy of Bombay Badonkadonks.\nLeonard: He got a cat to keep him company.\nRaj: You\xe2\x80\x99re kidding.\nLeonard: He takes it everywhere, to bed, to the bathroom.\nRaj: He takes the kitty to the potty?\nHoward: I thought we discussed the P-word.\nRaj: Don\xe2\x80\x99t try to change me, dude. I am what I am.\nSheldon: Oh, gentlemen.\nHoward: Hey. Aren\xe2\x80\x99t you going to introduce us to your little friend?\nSheldon: My apologies. Raj, Howard, I\xe2\x80\x99d like you to meet Dr. Robert Oppenheimer.\nHoward: Hello.\nRaj: Hi.\nSheldon: Now, if you\xe2\x80\x99ll excuse me, the father of the atomic bomb wants a saucer of milk.\nHoward: Okay, I get it. We\xe2\x80\x99re worried about Sheldon.\nLeonard: Yeah.\nScene: The apartment. Leonard arrives.\nLeonard: Hey. (Turns to see Sheldon now has five cats) Oh, no.\nSheldon: Robert Oppenheimer was lonely.\nLeonard: So you decided to get the whole Manhattan Project?\nSheldon: Yes. This is Enrico Fermi, Richard Feynman, Edward Teller, Otto Frisch, and Zazzles.\nLeonard: Zazzles?\nSheldon: I was going to name him Herman von Helmholtz, but he\xe2\x80\x99s so zazzy.\nLeonard: Okay, we need to talk.\nSheldon: About what?\nLeonard: Cats, Sheldon. You\xe2\x80\x99re clearly upset about Amy being gone, and you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to replace her with a bunch of cats.\nSheldon: Clowder.\nLeonard: What?\nSheldon: A group of cats is a clowder. Or a glaring.\nLeonard: Okay, yeah, fine.\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s the kind of thing you ought to know now that we have one.\nLeonard: Terrific. My-my point is you need to face up to what you\xe2\x80\x99re feeling with this breakup.\nSheldon: It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a breakup. A breakup would imply that Amy was my girlfriend.\nLeonard: Okay, I got it, I got it, she\xe2\x80\x99s not your girlfriend. Now listen to me. I know about loneliness. I know about trying to replace someone with other stuff. When I broke up with Penny, I got back into my cello, I built a bunch of model rockets, I got those weightlifting gloves and that five-pound dumbbell.\nSheldon: You didn\xe2\x80\x99t break up, she dumped you.\nLeonard: She didn\xe2\x80\x99t dump me. It was mutual!\nSheldon: I was there. She dumped you.\nLeonard: Okay, fine. Live with cats. Be like my Aunt Nancy. She had dozens of them. And do you know what happened after she died? They ate her.\nSheldon: You don\xe2\x80\x99t have to sell me on cats, Leonard. I\xe2\x80\x99m already a fan. All right, fellas, who\xe2\x80\x99s in the mood for Fancy Feast? Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s not fancy at all.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: Hi, Mrs. Cooper. Thanks for coming.\nMrs Cooper: Where is he?\nLeonard: He\xe2\x80\x99s in his bedroom.\nMrs Cooper: Now, when you said on the phone he broke up with a girl, you meant an actual girl, not something you kids whipped up in a lab?\nLeonard: No, she\xe2\x80\x99s real.\nMrs Cooper: Did they sin?\nLeonard: No, no, it\xe2\x80\x99s not like that. It\xe2\x80\x99s, uh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what it\xe2\x80\x99s like. But there is something I should prepare you for.\nMrs Cooper: Oh, relax, Leonard, I have raised that boy. I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen him at his best, I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen him at his worst. There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing he can do that\xe2\x80\x99ll surprise me.\nLeonard: Hold on to that thought. (Knocks on Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom door)\nSheldon: Come in. (They enter. The room is full of cats.)\nLeonard: Surprise.\nSheldon: Mom, what an unexpected pleasure.\nMrs Cooper: My, my, that\xe2\x80\x99s a powerful smell.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99d like you to meet Oppenheimer, Frisch, Panofsky, Feynman, Weisskopf\xe2\x80\xa6\nMrs Cooper: Yeah, I get it. You got a lot of cats and you gave \xe2\x80\x99em cute Jewish names.\nSheldon: What are you doing here?\nMrs Cooper: Leonard called, and he said that you were pining for a young lady.\nSheldon: Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s preposterous. I\xe2\x80\x99m not pining over anyone.\nMrs Cooper: Oh, lambchop, we can quibble what to call it, but I think we can both agree it\xe2\x80\x99s creepy.\nSheldon: I do not agree. Cats make wonderful companions. They don\xe2\x80\x99t argue or question my intellectual authority, and this little guy here, I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll find to be quite zazzy.\nMrs Cooper: You should have called sooner.\nScene: The kitchen.\nMrs Cooper: Shelly! Dinner\xe2\x80\x99s ready!\nSheldon: Coming!\nMrs Cooper: No cats!\nSheldon: Aw.(Enters to find Amy) What is she doing here?\nMrs Cooper: I called her.\nAmy: Your mother thinks you might be losing your mind over me. As a neurobiologist, I was curious.\nSheldon: Well, rest assured, I am in full possession of my faculties.\nLeonard (pretending to sneeze): 25 cats!\nMrs Cooper: Oh, God bless you, dear. Sheldon, sit down. Let\xe2\x80\x99s talk.\nSheldon: All right, but you\xe2\x80\x99re not fooling me. Whenever you say we have to talk, it means you want me to listen.\nMrs Cooper: Then stop talking.\nSheldon: Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\nMrs Cooper: Now, the reason I called Amy over was to find out what type of person she is. And after chatting a bit, I have to say that while she is a perfectly unique young woman, you two are definitely not suited for each other.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s a peculiar conclusion. By any standard, Amy is more similar to me than anyone I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever met.\nMrs Cooper: Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, Shelly, I can\xe2\x80\x99t see it.\nSheldon: Well, whether you see it or not is irrelevant. I can\xe2\x80\x99t see subatomic particles, but nevertheless, they\xe2\x80\x99re there.\nAmy: Excellent point.\nSheldon: A physics point.\nAmy: Touche.\nMrs Cooper: Well, putting aside the pig Latin, it\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing that you two decided to end the relationship so I didn\xe2\x80\x99t have to end it for you.\nSheldon: Amy, after consideration, I believe we may have acted rashly. I propose we resume our relationship and attempt to resolve our differences.\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99ll agree to that only if you\xe2\x80\x99ll stipulate that 80% of our difficulties were caused by you.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99ll go as high as 40.\nAmy: Sixty-five.\nSheldon: Done. You understand that moving forward, we deal with the fact that my mother does not approve of you?\nAmy: I do. I find being cast in the role of bad girl oddly titillating.\nSheldon: Would you like to see my cats?\nAmy: I would. I love cats. They\xe2\x80\x99re the epitome of indifference.\nSheldon: Ah, then you may find Zazzles a little cloying.\nLeonard: I saw what you did there.\nMrs Cooper: He thinks he\xe2\x80\x99s such a smarty pants. He\xe2\x80\x99s no different from any man. You tell \xe2\x80\x99em not to do something, that\xe2\x80\x99s all they want to do. If I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t told my brother Stumpy not to clear out the wood chipper by hand, we\xe2\x80\x99d still be calling him Edward. Now, don\xe2\x80\x99t you move. I\xe2\x80\x99ll bring over all the food.\nLeonard: No, no, no, I can do it.\nMrs Cooper: Well, isn\xe2\x80\x99t that sweet?\nScene: Outside. Sheldon is sitting at a table with a sign reading \xe2\x80\x9cCats $20\xe2\x80\x9d)\nSheldon: Thank you, Amy. Here\xe2\x80\x99s your cat. And here\xe2\x80\x99s your $20.\nAmy: Next!\nSheldon: Thank you, Amy. Here\xe2\x80\x99s your cat. And here\xe2\x80\x99s your $20.\nAmy: Next!\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
