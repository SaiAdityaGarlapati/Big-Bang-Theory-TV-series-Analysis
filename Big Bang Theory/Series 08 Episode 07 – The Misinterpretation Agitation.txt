b'Scene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nBernadette: So, what are you working on these days?\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99m studying one-celled organisms to try and find the neurochemicals that lead to the feeling of shame.\nBernadette: What would a one-celled organism have to be embarrassed about?\nPenny: Same as all of us, getting out of a car without underwear.\nBermadette: Speaking of underwear, I have some interesting news.\nPenny: Okay, if it\xe2\x80\x99s sometimes Howie wears yours, Leonard already told us.\nBernadette: He was being funny. I\xe2\x80\x99m pretty sure. Anyway, I was asked to be a part of a magazine article about the 50 sexiest female scientists in California. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that cool?\nAmy: I think it\xe2\x80\x99s awful.\nPenny: Why would you say that?\nAmy: Bernadette is a successful microbiologist. She should be celebrated for her achievements, not her looks. I mean, what kind of message does that send?\nPenny: I think the message is check out the rack on that scientist.\nBernadette: Why can\xe2\x80\x99t someone be thought of as both smart and pretty?\nAmy: I just don\xe2\x80\x99t think a professional woman should have to flaunt her sexuality in order to get ahead.\nPenny: Okay, what\xe2\x80\x99s the big deal? Look, if it helps me make a sale with a physician, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it hurts to flirt a little. I mean, laugh at their joke, touch their arm, maybe crank up the AC in the car beforehand, you know, to wake up the girls.\nAmy: Maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s different in the world of sales, but it\xe2\x80\x99s already hard enough for women to be taken seriously in science.\nBernadette: I was kind of excited about the article, but now you\xe2\x80\x99re making me feel bad.\nPenny: No, I think you should do whatever you want. You know, maybe if fashion magazines had female scientists in them, I would\xe2\x80\x99ve become a theoretical physicist. Stop smirking at each other.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The building foyer.\nMan with Flowers: Thank you.\nSheldon: No, thank you. Delivery men are the unsung foot soldiers of our nation\xe2\x80\x99s commerce. It\xe2\x80\x99s because of people like you, people like me can limit our human contact. I\xe2\x80\x99d shake your hand, but, well, you know.\nMan: I\xe2\x80\x99m not a delivery man, I\xe2\x80\x99m a doctor. Although I do often deliver alarming biopsy results to my patients.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s humorous.\nMan: All right.\nSheldon: Yeah, I bet you leave your patients in stitches. That was also humorous.\nMan: All right.\nSheldon: Are you bringing flowers to a patient to cushion the blow of a terminal diagnosis? That wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a joke.\nMan: All right. These are actually for a nice woman who makes sales calls to my office.\nSheldon: Hmm. You know, they have delivery people that will do that for you.\nMan: I was hoping to impress her by tracking her down on the Internet and then showing up unannounced at her door.\nSheldon: Making the extra effort. Good for you.\nLeonard: Great timing, food just got here.\nSheldon: Ooh, Siam Palace?\nLeonard: Yes.\nSheldon: Uh, mee krob and chicken satay?\nLeonard: Yes.\nSheldon: Uh, extra peanut sauce?\nLeonard: No, but you can have mine.\nSheldon: Eh, well, very well. Oh, and on the topic of sharing things that are yours, there is a gentleman caller bringing flowers to your fianc\xc3\xa9e as we speak.\nLeonard: What? Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you say that first?\nSheldon: Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you get extra peanut sauce? We can both play this game.\nLeonard: Can I help you?\nMan: Oh, hi. Uh, does Penny live here?\nLeonard: May I ask why?\nMan: Well, uh, I met her at my office, she winked at me. And, uh, I came hoping to initiate a romantic relationship.\nLeonard: Okay, um, look, I\xe2\x80\x99m pretty sure she didn\xe2\x80\x99t wink at you.\nMan: Oh, she did. Seductively, like this. And then she touched my arm for two Mississippis. Like, you know, one Mississippi, two\xe2\x80\xa6\nLeonard: I got it, I got it. Listen, um, I think there\xe2\x80\x99s been a misunderstanding. See, Penny is my fianc\xc3\xa9e.\nMan: Really? I\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen her wear an engagement ring.\nRaj: Really?\nMan: So, am I to presume that her flirtation was just a sales technique?\nLeonard: I think so.\nMan: When will I learn? It\xe2\x80\x99s just like the cute girl at the pet store all over again.\nLeonard: Excuse me?\nMan: Oh, uh, she touched my arm for five Mississippis, and I bought a two thousand dollar iguana habitat. Which she was always too busy to come over and see. You give these to Penny. You\xe2\x80\x99re a, you\xe2\x80\x99re a lucky man.\nLeonard: Thank you. Sorry.\nMan: Oh, uh, you probably don\xe2\x80\x99t want her to see this. It\xe2\x80\x99s unnecessarily graphic.\nSheldon: Hold on, Doctor. Leonard, where are your social skills? This man is clearly upset. We should invite him in for a hot beverage.\nLeonard: He tried to score with Penny.\nSheldon: So have these two, and they\xe2\x80\x99re having dinner with us.\nScene: A bar.\nAmy: So, how was work today?\nBernadette: It was fine, but you\xe2\x80\x99ll be happy to know they pulled the sexy scientists article.\nAmy: What happened?\nBernadette: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. They just canceled the photo shoot and said they\xe2\x80\x99re rethinking it.\nAmy: Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m really sorry, but I think it\xe2\x80\x99s for the best. You want people focusing on your achievements, not staring at your breasts in some magazine.\nBernadette: I guess. It\xe2\x80\x99s really not that important. Hey, up here.\nAmy: Sorry, it\xe2\x80\x99s just we\xe2\x80\x99re, we were talking about them. So, look, I, I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to say anything, but since you seem to be okay with the article being canceled, I have a little confession. I\xe2\x80\x99m the reason it was pulled.\nBernadette: What? How?\nAmy: I sent the editors of the magazine a pretty scathing e-mail.\nBernadette: Amy, what did you say?\nAmy: I simply pointed out that they would never consider doing an article ranking male scientists on their sexuality, let alone showing them in various stages of undress.\nBernadette: Because no one wants to see Neil deGrasse Tyson in a wet T-shirt, bent over the hood of a Porsche.\nAmy: Well, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make a difference, because they agreed it was in bad taste, and now you agree, so Amy saves the day.\nBernadette: No, what happened was you got jealous, so you took away a chance for me to get some publicity.\nAmy: But it was bad publicity.\nBernadette: That\xe2\x80\x99s for me to decide, not you.\nAmy: I disagree. As a female scientist, I think what you do affects all of us.\nBernadette: And I think you don\xe2\x80\x99t like people expressing their sexuality because no one wants you to express yours. Oh, Amy, I\xe2\x80\x99m so sorry. That was over the line.\nAmy: You have a nice night.\nBernadette: Please don\xe2\x80\x99t go. Up until my vicious attack, you were the one in the wrong.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Here you go, Doctor. Red Zinger with one teaspoon of honey.\nMan: Thank you. Neat Star Trek mug. I actually have one of the phasers from the original TV show.\nRaj: Oh, cool.\nHoward: How\xe2\x80\x99d you get that?\nMan: Oh, easy, Gene Roddenberry needed a vasectomy.\nSehldon: Wait a minute. You\xe2\x80\x99ve snipped Gene Roddenberry\xe2\x80\x99s vas deferens?\nMan: Yes.\nHoward: Wow, he really went where no man has gone before.\nMan: I don\xe2\x80\x99t like to brag,but, uh, you see, I\xe2\x80\x99m kind of the doctor to the stars\xe2\x80\x99 urinary tracts.\nAll: Wow.\nMan: Uh, you, you want to see James Cameron\xe2\x80\x99s kidney stone?\nAll: Ooh.\nMan: He was so happy after he passed it, he gave me a Terminator.\nLeonard: That is amazing. How long have you been collecting?\nMan: Ever since I was a kid, but, uh, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t really get serious until William Shatner\xe2\x80\x99s bladder infection.\nSheldon: What\xe2\x80\x99d you get? What\xe2\x80\x99d you get?\nMan: Well, he said it was a tribble. It could be a toupee, but either way, it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty cool.\nRaj: I would love to see your collection.\nMan: Anytime. Uh, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got some cool stuff. When I first started, I thought it would be a good way to meet women, but, well, you know.\nHoward: We know.\nRaj: Preach.\nMan: Can I ask you a personal question?\nLeonard: Sure.\nMan: Um, I mean, you\xe2\x80\x99re a guy like me, so how\xe2\x80\x99d you get a girl like Penny?\nLeonard: Oh. Well, you know, just being myself, really.\nSheldon: Oh, please, you know, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you how he did it. Implacable, relentless badgering. In urology terms, he was a drug-resistant staph infection. And she was a urethra that could not shake him.\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that I\xe2\x80\x99d call myself an infection.\nHoward: A gallant man would defend his fianc\xc3\xa9e for being called a urethra.\nLeonard: Can we please change the subject?\nPenny: Hi.\nRaj: Well, that didn\xe2\x80\x99t go your way.\nPenny: Dr. Lorvis, what are you doing here?\nDr Lorvis: Uh, well, actually I came to see you.\nPenny: Really? Why?\nLeonard: Ah, that\xe2\x80\x99s a good question. Apparently someone was being awfully flirty while not wearing their engagement ring, causing another someone to show up here thinking the first someone might be available.\nSheldon: Oh, God. Don\xe2\x80\x99t make it so hard on her. Look, the first someone is the deceitful you. The second someone is the delightful Dr. Lorvis.\nPenny: Oh, this is very embarrassing. Dr. Lorvis, I am so sorry. I did not mean to lead you on.\nDr Lorvis: You touched my arm for two Mississippis.\nPenny: Oh. That\xe2\x80\x99s why you were mumbling Mississippi.\nLeonard: Can we talk in private?\nPenny: Please, yes.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99ll be right back.\nSheldon: So what other celebrity genitalia have you handled?\nLeonard: So, uh, what\xe2\x80\x99s the deal? You take off your ring when you go to work?\nPenny: What? No, no, I just put it on the other hand and turn it around. Keep that hand in my pocket.\nLeonard: Why?\nPenny: Well, what do you mean why? Look, I make more sales if these doctors think I\xe2\x80\x99m single. I did the same kind of thing as a waitress. The real question is, what is he doing in your apartment?\nLeonard: Oh, he was upset. So Sheldon invited him in for a hot beverage.\nPenny: You were okay with that?\nLeonard: No. I got upset. And Sheldon made me a beverage, too.\nPenny: Okay, he just showed up at my door. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you think that\xe2\x80\x99s a little weird?\nLeonard: A little, but he\xe2\x80\x99s basically harmless. He\xe2\x80\x99s actually kind of a nice guy.\nPenny: Okay. Whatever, look, my company does not allow me to socialize with doctors outside of work. You got to get rid of him.\nLeonard: Why am I the one that has to get rid of him?\nPenny: I can\xe2\x80\x99t do it, he\xe2\x80\x99s my best client.\nLeonard: All right, I\xe2\x80\x99ll get rid of him. But you owe me one.\nRaj: Hey, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to Oliver\xe2\x80\x99s house to see his collection. You want to go with us?\nLeonard: Yeah, sure. You owe me.\nScene: Dr Lorvis\xe2\x80\x99 basement.\nLeonard: Oh, my God.\nSheldon: Leonard, I was wrong. Heaven does exist. And it\xe2\x80\x99s in the basement of a urologist\xe2\x80\x99s house in Sherman Oaks.\nDr Lorvis: Welcome to my Fortress of Solitude. This is where I go to get away from all my other solitude.\nHoward: Oh, come on. It\xe2\x80\x99s a replica.\nDr Lorvis: Original.\nHoward: Oh, I think I just cheated on my wife.\nRaj: The gun from Hellboy?\nDr Lorvis: Yup.\nRaj: How did you get it?\nDr Lorvis: Bought it at auction.\nRaj: Oh, I was hoping for a juicy tidbit about Ron Perlman\xe2\x80\x99s testicles.\nWoman\xe2\x80\x99s voice (off): Oliver, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to play bingo.\nDr Lorvis: Okay, Mother. Have fun.\nHoward: Still lives with his ma. Yikes, right?\nRaj: Yeah, I\xe2\x80\x99m not quite sure how to respond.\nLeonard: Wow, Donkey Kong. This, this was my game when I was a kid.\nSheldon: Because it\xe2\x80\x99s a story of a pretty blonde girl tirelessly pursued by a small, oddly-shaped man?\nLeonard: No, because I liked it.\nSheldon: Well, now, don\xe2\x80\x99t get defensive. You\xe2\x80\x99re oddly-shaped, but you got the girl.\nDr Lorvis: So, I\xe2\x80\x99ve noticed Leonard gets teased a lot 0about his relationship with Penny.\nSheldon: Yes. If you\xe2\x80\x99d like to join in, the premise is their love seems unlikely and doomed to failure.\nDr Lorvis: So, you think she\xe2\x80\x99ll be single soon?\nSheldon: Oh, if you want to get in on the pool, you\xe2\x80\x99re too late. All the squares have been purchased.\nDr Lorvis: Interesting. Excuse me, I have to take care of something.\nSheldon: Leonard, as your friend I feel I should tell you something.\nLeonard: What?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m still upset about that peanut sauce.\nScene: The lobby.\nDr Lorvis: Oh, could you hold the door?\nAmy: Nice flowers.\nDr Lorvis: Thank you. They\xe2\x80\x99re for a girl. Uh, I\xe2\x80\x99m being implacable and relentless.\nAmy: Isn\xe2\x80\x99t she lucky?\nDr Lorvis: She keeps sending me mixed signals. But I think we both want the same thing.\nAmy: What\xe2\x80\x99s that?\nDr Lorvis: Unconditional love.\nAmy: I guess that\xe2\x80\x99s all anybody wants.\nDr Lorvis: I guess so.\nAmy: Well, I hope you get it.\nDr Lorvis: One Mississippi, two Mississippi.\nScene: Dr Lorvis\xe2\x80\x99 basement.\nLeonard: Next game, let\xe2\x80\x99s switch helmets.\nSheldon: No, I\xe2\x80\x99d look silly in that helmet.\nScene: The stairwell.\nAmy: I can\xe2\x80\x99t take these.\nDr Lorvis: Why not? I mean, you want what I want. And we had two wonderful Mississippis.\nAmy: But what about the other girl?\nDr Lorvis: Oh, right. I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell her we should just be friends.\nPenny: Dr. Lorvis?\nDr Lorvis: Penny, we should just be friends. Happy?\nScene: Dr Lorvis\xe2\x80\x99 basement.\nRaj: You think he bites?\nHoward: Stick your head in there and find out.\nRaj: You fooled me with that goat at the petting zoo. You will not fool me again.\nLeonard: I wonder where Dr. Lorvis is. He\xe2\x80\x99s been gone a while.\nRaj: Maybe he\xe2\x80\x99s playing bingo with his mommy.\nHoward: It\xe2\x80\x99s sad how some guys can\xe2\x80\x99t cut the apron strings.\nRaj: Okay, now you\xe2\x80\x99re messing with me.\nLeonard: Uh, guys, we\xe2\x80\x99re locked in here.\nSheldon: Oh, this day just keeps getting better.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nPenny: So, you just left them alone playing games in your house?\nDr Lorvis: Well, they seemed happy and I thought that would give me time for you and I to get to know each other better. That was before we met.\nAmy: We all have a past.\nPenny: Doc, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to see what you\xe2\x80\x99re doing is, is a little creepy.\nDr Lorvis: You sound just like Sigourney Weaver when I followed her into a restroom.\nPenny: Okay, you can\xe2\x80\x99t just go chasing after every girl who\xe2\x80\x99s nice to you.\nDr Lorvis: Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s not what Sheldon says. And he seems to know his way around the ladies.\nPenny (on phone): Hey, Leonard. Guess who\xe2\x80\x99s back. Dr. Lorvis. Yeah. You care to join us? What? You locked them in your basement?\nDr Lorvis: Well, they\xe2\x80\x99re, they\xe2\x80\x99re not locked in. The door just sticks.\nPenny: Okay, so how do they unstick it?\nDr Lorvis: They\xe2\x80\x99d need the key.\nPenny: Okay. Nope. That\xe2\x80\x99s it. We are gonna go over there right now, and you are going to let them out.\nDr Lorvis: Three Mississippi, four Mississippi.\nPenny: Move it.\nScene: The foyer.\nBernadette: Oh, good, you\xe2\x80\x99re here. Amy, I am so sorry.\nAmy: That has to wait. This weirdo locked the guys up in his basement.\nBernadette: What?\nDr Lorvis: She seems nice. Who\xe2\x80\x99s she?\nPenny: Just walk.\nScene: Dr Lorvis\xe2\x80\x99 basement.\nSheldon: You can do this.\nRaj: One ladder left.\nLeonard: Oh-hom yeah.\nHoward: Yes.\nLeonard: Next level.\nPenny: Leonard, are you okay?\nLeonard: Better than okay. I am having the game of my life.\nAmy: Dr. Lorvis, isn\xe2\x80\x99t there something you want to say?\nDr Lorvis: Yes. I\xe2\x80\x99m very sorry for locking you in my home.\nHoward: Yeah, that was very uncool. Get the hammer. Get the hammer.\nLeonard: Got it.\nPenny: Okay, Leonard, let\xe2\x80\x99s go.\nLeonard: Just hang on.\nDr Lorvis: Well, while we wait, would you like to see Tobey Maguire\xe2\x80\x99s prostate sonogram?\nAmy: Sure.\nPenny: Yeah.\nDr Lorvis: Oh, spoiler alert. He was worried about nothing.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
