b'Scene: The apartment\nRaj: It\xe2\x80\x99s, like, the best one they make, I just can\xe2\x80\x99t get it to work.\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99ll figure it out.\nRaj: It streams HD video straight to your phone while it\xe2\x80\x99s flying.\nHoward: Nice. Where were you when I was single?\nLeonard: Okay, we should leave in about an hour. You all packed?\nPenny: Uh, yeah, I just need to throw in a few last minute things, you know, makeup, underwear, clothes.\nSheldon: If your bathroom floor counts as a carry-on, you\xe2\x80\x99re packed.\nAmy: Leonard, have you ever given a high school commencement speech before?\nLeonard: Nope. It\xe2\x80\x99s pretty exciting.\nSheldon: Aren\xe2\x80\x99t you afraid of being blinded?\nLeonard: How would I be blinded?\nSheldon: At the end of the ceremony, all the students throw those pointy hats in the air. It\xe2\x80\x99s all pomp and circumstance until someone loses an eye.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99ll take my chances.\nSheldon: Fine. I wonder if they make I told you so cards in braille.\nRaj: Look, the problem with commencement speeches is that they\xe2\x80\x99re boring. Ooh, do you own a T-shirt cannon?\nHoward: Why would he own a T-shirt cannon?\nRaj: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Why do I own one?\nAmy: I think it\xe2\x80\x99s really nice that you\xe2\x80\x99re sharing this experience with Penny.\nLeonard: Mm, I thought it\xe2\x80\x99d be fun to show her my old stomping grounds. I even know the exact spot where they used to stomp me.\nBernadette: Well, now you get to go back as a successful scientist.\nAmy: With a beautiful girl on your arm.\nSheldon: And a pointy hat sticking out of your eyeball.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The hallway.\nLeonard: How\xe2\x80\x99d you get ready so fast?\nPenny: Oh, I pack light. Once, I got through an entire spring break with nothing but a long T-shirt and a belt.\nLeonard: Why did you need a belt?\nPenny: It\xe2\x80\x99s called an evening look. I\xe2\x80\x99ve never been to New Jersey before.\nLeonard: It gets a bad rap from shows like Jersey Shore and Real Housewives.\nPenny: So it\xe2\x80\x99s not really like that?\nLeonard: No, it\xe2\x80\x99s like that. Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m excited to show you around.\nPenny: You think we\xe2\x80\x99ll have time to visit your mom over there?\nLeonard: Yes. We\xe2\x80\x99ll also have time to put my junk in a garlic press, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not doing that either. (Receives text) Uh-oh. I just got an alert. Our flight\xe2\x80\x99s been cancelled.\nPenny: What?\nLeonard: Yeah, looks like there\xe2\x80\x99s a big storm all up the East Coast.\nPenny: Well, can we get on another airline?\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t think so.\nPenny: So, that\xe2\x80\x99s it? We\xe2\x80\x99re not going?\nLeonard: I guess not.\nPenny: Well, that sucks.\nLeonard: Yeah. I worked hard on that speech, too.\nPenny: Oh. You could tell it to me.\nLeonard: Oh, thank you, but I\xe2\x80\x99m okay.\nPenny: Are you sure? I could pretend I\xe2\x80\x99m a high school cheerleader who can\xe2\x80\x99t control herself around esteemed alumni.\nLeonard: Greetings, distinguished cheerleaders.\nPenny: Ooh.\nScene: The apartment.\nHoward: Okay, the WiFi extender is on, the camera\xe2\x80\x99s on, they\xe2\x80\x99re both on the same network. We should be getting an image.\nSheldon: All I see is a black screen. And my own reflection. I look sad.\nHoward: Maybe we should recalibrate it.\nSheldon: All right.\nHoward: Step one, rapidly flip the calibration switch from the fully up to the fully down positions for at least ten times.\nSheldon: It actually says at least?\nHoward: Yeah.\nSheldon: Why would they say at least? Is it ten toggles? Is it a hundred toggles? You know? Is it a thousand toggles? Ten thousand toggles? A hundred thousand toggles?\nHoward: Sheldon.\nSheldon: You see where I\xe2\x80\x99m going with this.\nHoward: Just flip the switch until the lights on the drone change to solid yellow.\nSheldon: All right, that seems simple enough. Initiating calibration sequence. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. Well, I suppose ten is technically at least ten. But they\xe2\x80\x99re still getting at least one angry letter.\nHoward: Now I rotate it horizontally on its centre axis until the lights turn green.\nSheldon: Initiating rotation sequence. Don\xe2\x80\x99t look at me, initiate. What does red and yellow mean?\nHoward: It means the calibration failed. We have to start over.\nSheldon: Oh. Very well. Re-initiating calibration sequence. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten\xe2\x80\xa6 eleven. It\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing I didn\xe2\x80\x99t send that letter.\nScene: Raj\xe2\x80\x99s apartment. Skype tone plays.\nRaj: Mm. Hello, Daddy. What\xe2\x80\x99s up?\nDr Koothrapalli: Not much, just wanted to see how my son\xe2\x80\x99s doing.\nRaj: Very well, thank you.\nDr Koothrapalli: Are you still dating that dermatologist?\nRaj: If you could feel how soft my skin is, you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have to ask.\nDr Koothrapalli: Oh, and there\xe2\x80\x99s something else I wanted to ask you. Why did you spend a month\xe2\x80\x99s rent on a toy helicopter?!\nRaj: Oh, you\xe2\x80\x99re where that bill goes.\nDr Koothrapalli: I\xe2\x80\x99m tired of indulging your foolish lifestyle. It\xe2\x80\x99s time you learned responsibility. And the only way to teach you that is to cut off your allowance.\nRaj: No, Daddy, no. There are lots of other ways to teach me responsibility. I know, you can give me an egg and make me take care of it for a week.\nDr Koothrapalli: No, my mind is made up. Starting now, you\xe2\x80\x99re on your own.\nRaj: But, Daddy, I, I miss my family so much, and with you and Mummy getting a divorce, I feel sad and empty. Buying a little toy every now and then helps me fill that void. So while I can\xe2\x80\x99t hug you every day, flying that helicopter\xe2\x80\xa6\nDr Koothrapalli: I\xe2\x80\x99m cutting you off.\nRaj: Just to be clear, financially or mid-sentence?\nScene: The apartment.\nHoward: No red and yellow, no red and yellow.\nSheldon: Yay.\nHoward: It\xe2\x80\x99s green.\nSheldon: We did it. Oh, if it\xe2\x80\x99s this much fun to rotate, imagine when we fly it.\nHoward: Okay, now all I have to do is rotate it vertically until the lights turn off.\nSheldon: Oh, no.\nHoward: Oh. All right, playtime\xe2\x80\x99s over. Let\xe2\x80\x99s open this baby up.\nSheldon: Won\xe2\x80\x99t that void the warranty?\nHoward: Sheldon, I have a master\xe2\x80\x99s degree in engineering. I wipe my bottom with warranties. Except for AppleCare. That pays for itself in the long run.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nPenny: Hi.\nLeonard: Hey, where\xe2\x80\x99d you go?\nPenny: I got you a little something to cheer you up.\nLeonard: Really? Sex last night, pancakes this morning, am I dying?\nPenny: Just open it.\nLeonard: A cap and gown? Why do I need a cap and gown?\nPenny: Because you are giving your commencement speech.\nLeonard: What are you talking about?\nPenny: I called your old high school and convinced them to let you give your speech over Skype.\nLeonard: Really? That\xe2\x80\x99s amazing. And you gave me the robes to give it in. Thank you.\nPenny: Yeah, now about those, uh, they came from a costume shop, and all they had left was sexy graduate, so they might be a little short.\nLeonard: Short and sexy, that\xe2\x80\x99s my wheelhouse.\nPenny: Yeah.\nScene: The apartment.\nHoward: Boy, oh, boy, that\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of pieces.\nSheldon: You know what they all do, right?\nHoward: Yes, of course.\nSheldon: What about this one?\nHoward: Well, I, how familiar are you with miniaturized integrated logic circuits?\nSheldon: Not very.\nHoward: That right there is a miniaturized integrated logic circuit.\nSheldon: So, can you get it working?\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m an MIT-trained engineer. I\xe2\x80\x99ve built components for the space station.\nSheldon: I thought the zero-gravity toilet didn\xe2\x80\x99t work.\nHoward: It worked fine, it just wasn\xe2\x80\x99t designed for Russian cosmonauts and their potato-based diet.\nRaj: Hey, guys.\nHoward: Hey.\nSheldon: Hello.\nRaj: I have to return the helicopter. My father\xe2\x80\xa6 What did you do?\nSheldon: Well, don\xe2\x80\x99t worry. He went to MIT. He can solve any problem, as long as it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t originate in a Russian man\xe2\x80\x99s colon.\nRaj: I don\xe2\x80\x99t freaking believe this.\nHoward: Relax, it\xe2\x80\x99ll be fine.\nRaj: No, you have to put this back together right now, so I can return it.\nSheldon: You can\xe2\x80\x99t return it. Howard wiped his bottom with the warranty.\nRaj: What?\nSheldon: I think metaphorically. But he was in the bathroom for a while.\nRaj: Howard, my father cut me off. I have to get my money back for this.\nHoward: Calm down.\nRaj: Okay. Okay, you\xe2\x80\x99re right. It\xe2\x80\x99s time for me to step up and take responsibility for my life. Be a man. (On phone) Hello, Mummy.\nMrs Koothrapalli: Hello, Rajesh. What a nice surprise.\nRaj: Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been thinking about you. How are you doing? Are you happy, Mummy?\nMrs Koothrapalli: Such a sweet boy for asking. Can\xe2\x80\x99t believe you come from the poison seed of your father.\nRaj: Well, I like to think I take mostly after you. Anyway, speaking of Daddy, I had a very strange conversation with him. He said he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t afford to send me money any more because of his active social life.\nMrs Koothrapalli: What does that mean, active social life?\nRaj: Well, let\xe2\x80\x99s not talk about him or whatever shenanigans he may or may not be up to. Let\xe2\x80\x99s talk about you.\nMrs Koothrapalli: Rajesh, is your father seeing someone?\nRaj: All I know, Mummy, is that he\xe2\x80\x99s a single wealthy doctor, and now, for some reason, there\xe2\x80\x99s no money for your little boy.\nMrs Koothrapalli: Well, however much money your father was giving you, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you more.\nRaj: Thank you, Mummy, I love you. Helicopters for everybody.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nPenny: What\xe2\x80\x99s taking so long?\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t think this is gonna work.\nPenny: Just let me see. Sweetie, you know you\xe2\x80\x99re supposed to wear clothes underneath a graduation gown.\nLeonard: A, surprised you know that. B, I wanted to look like a sexy graduate for you.\nPenny: Oh. Well, you do.\nLeonard: Thank you.\nPenny: Yeah. You\xe2\x80\x99re gonna be on Skype, they\xe2\x80\x99re not gonna see your legs.\nLeonard: Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna go put on some pants just in case. But I have to say, this is very freeing.\nPenny: Add a belt and I\xe2\x80\x99ll take you some place nice.\nLeonard: Oh. Done and done.\nScene: The apartment.\nHoward: Okay, I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve narrowed it down to a faulty pin on the onboard communication chip.\nSheldon: Very impressive. You know, when you\xe2\x80\x99re done with that, can you look at this? It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make smoke anymore.\nHoward: One toy at a time.\nSheldon: Mm. Sorry. Ah, maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s for the best. I hear locomotive smoke is the second leading cause of death among train aficionados.\nRaj: What\xe2\x80\x99s the first one?\nHoward: Suicide.\nSheldon: Wrong. Obesity.\nBernadette: I have the tool you wanted.\nHoward: Thank you.\nRaj: You guys don\xe2\x80\x99t have to go to the trouble. I\xe2\x80\x99m back in the money now, I can just buy another helicopter.\nHoward: It\xe2\x80\x99s not about the money. It\xe2\x80\x99s about solving a problem. It\xe2\x80\x99s why I became an engineer. It\xe2\x80\x99s what I like to do, it\xe2\x80\x99s what I\xe2\x80\x99m trained to do. It\xe2\x80\x99s who I am.\nSheldon: Oh, look at you, the little engineer that could.\nBernadette: Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you just call tech support?\nHoward: Hey.\nSheldon: Whoa.\nRaj: Not cool.\nBernadette: What?\nHoward: There\xe2\x80\x99s two kinds of people in this world, those who call tech support, and those who make fun of the people who call tech support.\nBernadette: I call tech support all the time.\nHoward: Ha-ha.\nSheldon: You call tech support.\nRaj: What a baby.\nScene: Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s old school.\nHeadmaster: And now, for our commencement address, one of our most distinguished alumni, noted Caltech physicist Dr. Leonard Hofstadter.\nLeonard (on screen): Members of the faculty, students, I\xe2\x80\x99m excited to speak to you today. I can\xe2\x80\x99t help but remember the last time I was in this auditorium. Two guys from the lacrosse team played keep-away with my asthma inhaler. But enough about my ten-year reunion. I\xe2\x80\x99d also like to take a moment to thank my beautiful fianc\xc3\xa9e for to helping make this speech possible, even though weather nearly prevented it.\nPenny: Oh. Hello. I, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know he was gonna point it at me, so, don\xe2\x80\x99t do drugs and stay in school.\nLeonard: They\xe2\x80\x99re graduating.\nPenny: Okay, bye.\nScene: The apartment.\nHoward: All right, the power supply is reconnected. I think we\xe2\x80\x99re back in business. Let\xe2\x80\x99s just run a few tests before we take it outside. Sheldon, we got WiFi?\nSheldon: Check.\nHoward: GPS?\nRaj: Check.\nHoward: Battery charged?\nSheldon: Check.\nBernadette: Four hours of our lives gone? Check.\nHoward: All right. All systems go. In five\xe2\x80\xa6\nTogether: Four, three, two, one.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s what my train used to do.\nBernadette: Ready to call tech support?\nHoward: Give me the number. Probably wind up talking to some foreign guy who\xe2\x80\x99s reading from the same manual I have. (Raj\xe2\x80\x99s phone rings)\nRaj: It\xe2\x80\x99s my father, you jerks. Hello, Daddy.\nDr Koothrapalli: What did you say to your mother?\nRaj: Nothing. I was just calling to check in, make sure she\xe2\x80\x99s doing okay.\nDr Koothrapalli: Well, after talking to you, she seems to think I\xe2\x80\x99m some sort of playboy.\nRaj: Really? I don\xe2\x80\x99t know where she\xe2\x80\x99d get an idea like that. You know Mummy and her crazy imagination I\xe2\x80\x99m so lucky I take after you.\nDr Koothrapalli: You think you take after me?\nRaj: Well, I try to. I certainly wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be a scientist if you hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been my role model. (Re-entering apartment) Who wants to go to Vegas in a real helicopter?\nScene: Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s old school.\nLeonard (on screen): It was L. Frank Baum who said no thief, however skillful, can rob one of knowledge, and that is why knowledge is the best and safest treasure, wow, I\xe2\x80\x99m boring myself. Sorry, I can\xe2\x80\x99t see any of your faces right now, but I bet they look like this. Uh, you know, I, I wrote an entire speech to say how high school prepares you and what a wonderful place it is, but I hated it. Maybe high school\xe2\x80\x99s great if you look like this, but I didn\xe2\x80\x99t even feel like I existed at that school. And now that I think about it, I bet a lot of you feel the same way. So, for the remainder of my speech, this is for the invisible kids. Uh, maybe you never fit in. Or maybe you\xe2\x80\x99re the smallest kid in the school, or the heaviest or the weirdest. Maybe you\xe2\x80\x99re graduating and you still haven\xe2\x80\x99t had your first kiss. By the way, 19, and Geraldine Coco, wherever you are, thank you. Maybe you don\xe2\x80\x99t have any friends. And guess what? That\xe2\x80\x99s okay. While all the popular kids are off doing whatever, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what they were doing \xe2\x80\x99cause I was never there.\nPenny: I\xe2\x80\x99ll, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you later.\nLeonard: My point is, while you\xe2\x80\x99re spending all this time on your own, building computers or practicing your cello, what you\xe2\x80\x99re really doing is becoming interesting. And when people finally do notice you, they\xe2\x80\x99re gonna find someone a lot cooler than they thought. And for those of you who were popular in high school, it\xe2\x80\x99s over, sorry. Thank you and congratulations.\nScene: The apartment.\nTech Support Voice: Your call is important to us. All our technicians are busy helping other customers. Please stay on the line and someone will be with you shortly.\nHoward: What happened to me? When did I become an old man baffled by modern technology? Next thing you know, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be hitching my pants up to my armpits and complaining about the awful music the kids are listening to.\nSheldon: It is awful, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? Listen to that noise.\nHoward: Hang on, hang on. It\xe2\x80\x99s working. I did it.\nRaj: How\xe2\x80\x99d you do that?\nHoward: No idea, but I did it.\nBernadette: Maybe you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be flying it inside.\nHoward: Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not flying it.\nSheldon: Then who is?\nHoward: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Must be getting a WiFi signal from somewhere else.\nSheldon: Initiate landing sequence. Initiate landing sequence. Hey, the camera\xe2\x80\x99s working. Oh, look, it\xe2\x80\x99s me.\nTech Support Guy: Tech Support, can I help you?\nSheldon: Yes, it\xe2\x80\x99s a robot uprising. Call the police.\nScene: The hallway.\nLeonard: So you really think they liked it?\nPenny: Oh, sweetie, it was the best speech I\xe2\x80\xa6\nSheldon: Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry, everyone in here is safe.\nAdvertisements'
