b'Scene: The apartment.\nLeonard: We\xe2\x80\x99re pinned down.\nHoward: We can\xe2\x80\x99t get through.\nRaj: Sheldon, get over here and help.\nSheldon: Okay, one second.\nLeonard: Sheldon, why are you jumping up and down?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to shoot.\nHoward: Then use the shoot button, not the wonderful thing about Tiggers button.\nLeonard: Aw.\nRaj: That\xe2\x80\x99s it, we\xe2\x80\x99re dead.\nHoward: Okay, challenge them again.\nLeonard: Doing it right now. Oh, they can\xe2\x80\x99t. There\xe2\x80\x99s an important Little League game tomorrow.\nHoward: No wonder they beat us, they\xe2\x80\x99re jocks.\nSheldon: What happened to me? I used to excel at these things.\nHoward: Kids are always better at video games.\nSheldon: Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t like it.\nLeonard: Mm, if it makes you feel better, you still dress like a child.\nSheldon: No, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not just video games. I downloaded the new O.S. for my phone, took me a week to stop accidentally texting kissy faces to everyone.\nHoward: Oh, so our love is not real?\nRaj: Well, I know how you feel. I tried one of those electronic Japanese toilets, practically shot myself across the room.\nSheldon: I guess I just need to face it, I\xe2\x80\x99m no longer a wunderkind. Now I just wonder what\xe2\x80\x99s for lunch.\nLeonard: Hot dogs.\nSheldon: Yay.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: A bar.\nPenny: I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know you could drink while you\xe2\x80\x99re breastfeeding.\nBernadette: Yeah, they say the yeast in beer helps with milk production.\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99m pretty sure that\xe2\x80\x99s a myth, let me check.\nBernadette: Ruin it for me and I\xe2\x80\x99ll break this glass over your head.\nAmy: To denial.\nPenny: Ooh. I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna get another. You want food?\nBernadette: Yeah, breastfeeding burns, like, 5,000 calories a day. Do not touch that phone.\nZack: Penny?\nPenny: Oh, Zack. Hey.\nZack: What are the odds of running into you here?\nPenny: Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s a bar, so pretty good. Uh, what\xe2\x80\x99s new?\nZack: Oh, tons of stuff. Put artificial grass in my backyard, got engaged, had a scary mole that turned out to be Sharpie.\nPenny: Well, congratulations.\nZack: That\xe2\x80\x99s what my dermatologist said.\nPenny: No, on, on getting engaged, good for you.\nZack: Oh, thanks. How about you? Hey, how\xe2\x80\x99s Leonard? Is he still smart?\nPenny: Yes, yes, he\xe2\x80\x99s working for the government on an infinite persistence gyroscope. Of course, the first time I say it right, he\xe2\x80\x99s not even here.\nZack: I love that little guy. Hey, we should all have dinner sometime.\nPenny: Uh, yeah, sure, I\xe2\x80\x99ll check with Leonard.\nZack: Cool, I\xe2\x80\x99ll check with Sara. Sara, pull up my calendar. It never works for me.\nScene: The comic book store.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99ve been thinking about our recent humiliation.\nLeonard: You\xe2\x80\x99re gonna have to be more specific.\nSheldon: At the hands of those teenagers.\nLeonard: More.\nSheldon: Boy teenagers.\nLeonard: Oh, the video game. Yeah, that was bad.\nSheldon: I started doing some reading on cognitive vitality, and I came across an area of research called super-aging.\nRaj: You know who\xe2\x80\x99s a super-ager? Jennifer Lopez. Like, what is her secret?\nHoward: Now, this is rare. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know which one of you I want to stop talking first.\nSheldon: The theory is that if you really tax your brain, the neurofibers will become thicker and the glial cells more lustrous.\nRaj: Like J-Lo\xe2\x80\x99s hair.\nHoward: Boy, it is neck and neck right now.\nLeonard: How is super-aging any different than, like, doing crossword puzzles?\nSheldon: Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s not just doing simple cognitive tasks. You need to push your brain out of its comfort zone and reach mental exhaustion.\nLeonard: I drive you to work every day, my brain must look like the Hulk.\nRaj: If you really want to challenge yourself, you could learn to speak Hindi.\nSheldon: Jab mein aat saal ka tha maine seekha tha. (I did that when I was eight)\nRaj: Could you say that in English? I actually, I never learned Hindi.\nScene: The apartment.\nPenny: Hey, you ready to go?\nLeonard: Yeah, I guess.\nPenny: What\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\nLeonard: Honestly? It\xe2\x80\x99s a little strange having dinner with your ex-boyfriend, and it\xe2\x80\x99s not like we have a lot to talk about.\nPenny: What? He loves you, okay? And he\xe2\x80\x99s interested in your work. You could talk about the infinite perspective\xe2\x80\xa6 I swear I know it.\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99ll be fine, let\xe2\x80\x99s just go.\nPenny: Well, and his fianc\xc3\xa9e will be there, so you know, if the conversation lags, we can talk about their wedding.\nLeonard: Aaargh.\nPenny: Come on, I spent an entire plane ride with you talking about the trailer for Deadpool 2.\nLeonard: Ha, I knew you weren\xe2\x80\x99t asleep.\nScene: A restaurant.\nZack: Hey, guys.\nPenny: Hi. Hey, where\xe2\x80\x99s your fianc\xc3\xa9e?\nZack: Oh, she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t make it. She had an emergency.\nPenny: Oh, no, what happened?\nZack: I didn\xe2\x80\x99t ask.\nScene: Sheldon and Amy\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nAmy: Hey.\nSheldon: Hey.\nRaj: Hey.\nAmy: What smells so good?\nSheldon: Raj is teaching me to make croissants.\nAmy: Is this part of your super-aging?\nSheldon: Yes. Yeah, it seemed daunting at first, but then I realized, it\xe2\x80\x99s like the chemistry set I had as a kid. Only, when your brother eats this, no one has to call Poison Control.\nRaj: Okay. Shall we? Oh, my God. It\xe2\x80\x99s light, it\xe2\x80\x99s flaky, it\xe2\x80\x99s buttery. You don\xe2\x80\x99t need to have sex with him, just eat one of these.\nSheldon: Yes, it is delicious. Physicist, baker, lover, what can\xe2\x80\x99t I do?\nAmy: Well, clearly mental tasks are not enough. Maybe you need to challenge your motor skills.\nSheldon: For the last time, I am not having a tickle fight with you.\nRaj: You want a real challenge, try keeping me from eating more of these.\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re just using food to mask the fear that you\xe2\x80\x99re fundamentally unlovable and therefore going to be alone forever.\nRaj: Damn it, he\xe2\x80\x99s good at that, too.\nScene: The restaurant.\nZack: Thanks. Wow, working on a top secret government project, that is so cool. Do you have a bodyguard to keep spies away?\nLeonard: I have Sheldon, that keeps most people away.\nZack: I miss that guy. He\xe2\x80\x99s like the Swedish Chef Muppet. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what he\xe2\x80\x99s saying, but he\xe2\x80\x99s funny.\nLeonard: Oh, I know what he\xe2\x80\x99s saying, and he\xe2\x80\x99s not, he\xe2\x80\x99s not funny.\nZack: So, Penny, what\xe2\x80\x99s going on with you? How\xe2\x80\x99s the job?\nPenny: Uh, it\xe2\x80\x99s okay, I\xe2\x80\x99m still in pharmaceutical sales.\nLeonard: She\xe2\x80\x99s doing amazing. She can actually make a side effect, like 10% chance of liver failure, sound like a 90% chance of liver success.\nPenny: Yeah, lying isn\xe2\x80\x99t my favourite part of the job. Actually, I\xe2\x80\x99m not crazy about a lot of it.\nZack: Hey, if you\xe2\x80\x99re not happy there, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been looking for a new head of sales at my company. And we don\xe2\x80\x99t sell drugs, just menus, so the only lie you\xe2\x80\x99ll be telling is we print on recycled paper. We don\xe2\x80\x99t.\nPenny: Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s a nice offer.\nZack: You know, we\xe2\x80\x99d make a great team. Or as we say in the menu business, I can\xe2\x80\x99t do this without Me N U.\nPenny: Right, \xe2\x80\x99cause it spells menu.\nZack: Yeah, right? It\xe2\x80\x99s funny. I got a lot of menu jokes, but that\xe2\x80\x99s my favourite.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s kitchen.\nHoward: All right, this is everything. What do you want to learn?\nSheldon: It really doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter, as long as it\xe2\x80\x99s challenging.\nHoward: Okay, well, how about, oh, I teach you some close-up magic.\nSheldon: Howard, I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to make myself uncomfortable, not everyone else.\nBernadette: So you wanted to learn something physical and you came to Howard Wolowitz?\nHoward: Hey, the circus arts are very physically and mentally demanding. Have you ever tried to juggle?\nBernadette: Yes, I\xe2\x80\x99m juggling my love for you and my embarrassment of you right now.\nHoward: And it\xe2\x80\x99s hard, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? So the key is, the moment one ball is at the top of its arc, you toss the next one. Hmm?\nSheldon: Okay, I think I got that.\nHoward: Uh, hold on. There\xe2\x80\x99s an old saying in juggling.\nBernadette: Is it I\xe2\x80\x99m going to die alone?\nHoward: No, it\xe2\x80\x99s if you want to have fun, start with one. Yours we think, but we do not say. All right, just toss it up and catch it a few times, get comfortable with it.\nSheldon: Okay. Just to be on the safe side, am I in any danger of getting juggler\xe2\x80\x99s elbow?\nHoward: No.\nSheldon: Are you sure? \xe2\x80\x98Cause I\xe2\x80\x99m feeling a twinge.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s car.\nPenny: See, that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t so bad. He even picked up the check.\nLeonard: Yeah. Although, when he was trying to figure out the tip, I\xe2\x80\x99m pretty sure I saw smoke coming out of his ears. You\xe2\x80\x99re not really considering working for him, are you?\nPenny: Well, maybe, I mean, it seems kind of perfect. I have sales experience, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve been a waitress, so I have restaurant experience, and if he\xe2\x80\x99s figuring out my Christmas bonus, we could buy a boat.\nLeonard: Don\xe2\x80\x99t you think it might be a little weird to work for someone you used to date?\nPenny: You work with Sheldon, you tell me.\nLeonard: Yeah, it\xe2\x80\x99s weird.\nPenny: Okay, are you seriously jealous of me working with Zack?\nLeonard: No, no, I\xe2\x80\x99m not jealous, I just think you have got a good thing going where you are right now, and you make great money and you haven\xe2\x80\x99t slept with any of your co-workers.\nPenny: Great, so you want me to stay at a job I\xe2\x80\x99m not happy at?\nLeonard: Uh.\nPenny: You okay? You kind of look like Zack trying to figure out that tip.\nLeonard: Of course I don\xe2\x80\x99t want you to be unhappy, but I also want you to be smart, and working for an ex-boyfriend isn\xe2\x80\x99t very smart. You don\xe2\x80\x99t have to stop, just slow down, I\xe2\x80\x99ll jump out.\nScene: Sheldon and Amy\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nSheldon: Amy, look, I\xe2\x80\x99m on a unicycle!\nAmy: How did you get from croissants to a unicycle?\nSheldon: I hurt myself juggling.\nAmy: Where did you get it?\nSheldon: Howard said I could borrow it, Bernadette said forever.\nAmy: Have you tried letting go of the rope?\nSheldon: What, are you crazy? I\xe2\x80\x99m on a unicycle.\nAmy: All right, well, have fun.\nSheldon: Wait, I need help getting down.\nAmy: Well, what do you want me to do?\nSheldon: Drag out our mattress and put it over here, then go across the hall, get their mattress and put it over here. But before you do any of that, scratch my nose.\nScene: The apartment.\nHoward: So you told her she was being dumb?\nLeonard: No, I told her she was being not smart. Which was dumb.\nRaj: Why did you even go to dinner with the guy?\nLeonard: We covered this, I\xe2\x80\x99m dumb.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s kitchen.\nPenny: So he\xe2\x80\x99s my ex-boyfriend, who cares? I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe Leonard would be so insecure.\nBernadette: Really? I have no trouble believing that at all.\nPenny: And Zack\xe2\x80\x99s engaged. Leonard has no reason to feel threatened.\nBernadette: We\xe2\x80\x99re talking about the same Leonard, right?\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: So you think it\xe2\x80\x99s fine if she works for Zack?\nHoward: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, maybe.\nRaj: Well, he is much more attractive than Leonard.\nHoward: Yes, but that\xe2\x80\x99s gonna be true of a lot of guys she works for.\nLeonard: Yeah, but she also used to sleep with Zack.\nHoward: Again.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s kitchen.\nBernadette: I would never let Howard work with an ex.\nPenny: What, you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t trust him?\nBernadette: I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t trust her. He\xe2\x80\x99s thin and sexy like a Jewish greyhound.\nPenny: Yeah, that, that is the sexiest dog.\nBernadette: And I\xe2\x80\x99d like to think Howie wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t take a job I was uncomfortable with.\nPenny: \xe2\x80\x98Cause he\xe2\x80\x99s scared of you?\nBernadette: Terrified.\nPenny: Yeah.\nScene: The apartment.\nHoward: You know what? I\xe2\x80\x99m with Leonard, this isn\xe2\x80\x99t cool.\nLeonard: Thank you.\nRaj: I disagree. Penny is a strong, independent woman. The more you try to control her, the more she\xe2\x80\x99ll push back.\nLeonard: So you think it\xe2\x80\x99s okay?\nRaj: Oh, no, she\xe2\x80\x99s gonna leave you for someone, might as well get it over with.\nScene: Sheldon and Amy\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nAmy: What are you doing?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m returning this stuff to Howard.\nAmy: Oh. Well, Bernadette made me promise if you didn\xe2\x80\x99t want it, we\xe2\x80\x99d give it to a homeless clown. What happened to learning the unicycle?\nSheldon: Oh, I stopped that, it was dumb. Uni, bi, tri, menstrual, all cycles are dumb.\nAmy: You said juggling was dumb, too.\nSheldon: Well, it is. If I wanted to hold three things at once, I\xe2\x80\x99d wear cargo pants.\nAmy: Sheldon, is it possible that when things get really difficult, you just give up?\nSheldon: Are you calling me a quitter?\nAmy: Well, if you honestly\xe2\x80\xa6\nSheldon: This conversation is over.\nAmy: His mother warned me. Everybody warned me. Actually, he warned me.\nScene: The apartment.\nPenny: Hey.\nLeonard: Hi.\nPenny: You want to talk?\nLeonard: That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to be where I shine. How about I just give you one of these?\nPenny: Look, we can have a reasonable conversation and I won\xe2\x80\x99t get mad. I don\xe2\x80\x99t like it after sex, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t like it now.\nLeonard: Yeah, sorry.\nPenny: Yeah. All right, just come here. Look, I get me working with Zack is weird and I don\xe2\x80\x99t want you to be uncomfortable.\nLeonard: Well, thanks. And I don\xe2\x80\x99t want you to be stuck at a job you don\xe2\x80\x99t like.\nPenny: Then what do we do?\nLeonard: Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t love it, but if you really want to take this job, I\xe2\x80\x99ll find a way to deal with it.\nPenny: No, I know you\xe2\x80\x99ll try, but it\xe2\x80\x99ll make you miserable, which will make me miserable, and I\xe2\x80\x99m just gonna stay where I\xe2\x80\x99m at for now.\nLeonard: No, no, no, no, you\xe2\x80\x99re, you\xe2\x80\x99re unhappy there and then you\xe2\x80\x99re gonna blame me for making you stay, and it\xe2\x80\x99s fine, I\xe2\x80\x99ll just, I\xe2\x80\x99ll suck it up.\nPenny: You don\xe2\x80\x99t need to do that, it\xe2\x80\x99s okay.\nLeonard: Yeah, see, now I feel terrible, like I\xe2\x80\x99m being selfish and holding you back. What? Say something. Yeah, that is pretty annoying.\nScene: Sheldon and Amy\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom.\nAmy: I made you tea.\nSheldon: Thank you.\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry I called you a quitter.\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s okay, I stopped being upset about that. And no, the irony is not lost on me.\nAmy: What are you reading?\nSheldon: This article says the peak age for making a Nobel Prize-winning discovery is 40.\nAmy: So?\nSheldon: So I\xe2\x80\x99m running out of time.\nAmy: That\xe2\x80\x99s ridiculous, you\xe2\x80\x99re a brilliant man. The best years of your life are still ahead of you.\nSheldon: Oh, you have to say that, you\xe2\x80\x99re sweet on me.\nAmy: Well, if you\xe2\x80\x99re really worried about your career, maybe you should consider spending a little less time with video games and comic books.\nSheldon: Hey, I thought you were sweet on me.\nAmy: Okay, fine, let\xe2\x80\x99s say you never win a Nobel Prize. Let\xe2\x80\x99s say you spend your life doing solid scientific research surrounded by friends and loved ones who appreciate you, not for what you\xe2\x80\x99ve accomplished but for who you are as a man. Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t that be a life well-lived?\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re so cute. I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna go learn how to walk on stilts.\nAmy: So many warnings.\nScene: The apartment.\nPenny: Okay, are you sure about this?\nLeonard: Absolutely. I just want you to be happy. And maybe a little turned on about how selfless I\xe2\x80\x99m being.\nZack (on phone): Penny, what\xe2\x80\x99s up?\nPenny: Hey, uh, so I\xe2\x80\x99ve been thinking about it and I want to take the job.\nZack: Oh, bad news. When my fianc\xc3\xa9e found out that I was offering a job to my ex-girlfriend, she said it was a stupid idea and threw a shoe at me.\nPenny: Oh, so there\xe2\x80\x99s no job?\nZack: Nope, just a little bump on my forehead.\nPenny: Okay, thanks anyway. Bye. Well, his fianc\xc3\xa9e thought the idea of us working together was stupid. You were right, I was wrong. Aren\xe2\x80\x99t you gonna say anything?\nLeonard: Not if I want to be doing this later.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s kitchen.\nBernadette: Hey, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know you were home. Where you been?\nHoward: I went to see your mom.\nBernadette: Seriously, where were you?\nHoward: I just told you, your mom\xe2\x80\x99s.\nBernadette: Why?\nHoward: Well, since you find my magic tricks so embarrassing, I got to wondering what cool hobbies you had as a kid.\nBernadette: Oh. What\xe2\x80\x99d she say?\nHoward: She didn\xe2\x80\x99t say much of anything. But she said a lot. (Through ventriloquist\xe2\x80\x99s doll) Hi, Bernadette, remember me?\nBernadette: First of all, that\xe2\x80\x99s not what she sounds like, she\xe2\x80\x99s from South Carolina.\nHoward: I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe you made fun of me all these years while you were a closeted ventriloquist.\nBernadette: Okay, it\xe2\x80\x99s not like I wanted to be a ventriloquist. I was in beauty pageants and I needed a talent besides spreading rumours that the other contestants were pregnant.\nHoward: Well, since you enjoyed getting rid of all my stuff, you know, maybe we should throw this little lady in the wood chipper.\nBernadette: No. And the little lady has a name.\nHoward: Which is?\nBernadette: Tammy Jo St. Cloud.\nHoward: Tammy Jo St. Cloud. Oh, and I\xe2\x80\x99m a dork for juggling.\nBernadette: Sorry, you\xe2\x80\x99re not a dork. (Through doll) You\xe2\x80\x99re a clown. (Bernadette) Tammy Jo, don\xe2\x80\x99t say that, you\xe2\x80\x99ll make him feel bad. (Doll) Look at him, what reason he got to feel good?\nHoward: All right, very funny.\nBernadette: Don\xe2\x80\x99t listen to her, she\xe2\x80\x99s been in a box for, like, 25 years. (Doll) Yeah, back when his haircut was fashionable.\nHoward: That\xe2\x80\x99s enough, put her away.\nBernadette (as Doll): Oh, big daddy, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think so. You marry Miss Bernie, you marry me. We all family now.\nHoward: All right, you\xe2\x80\x99re freaking me out.\nBernadette (as Doll): Don\xe2\x80\x99t be that way. If you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind a few splinters, we can have us a m\xc3\xa9nage \xc3\xa0 trois. Ooh.\nScene: A street.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m doing it. I\xe2\x80\x99m doing it. I\xe2\x80\x99m tall and I\xe2\x80\x99m doing it. (Waking up in bed) Ah, man.\nAdvertisements'
