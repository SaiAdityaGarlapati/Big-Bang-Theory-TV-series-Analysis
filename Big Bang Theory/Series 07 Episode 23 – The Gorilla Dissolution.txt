b'Scene: The upstairs landing of Mrs Wolowitz\xe2\x80\x99s house.\nBernadette: Almost there. You\xe2\x80\x99re doing great.\nHoward: Thanks for lifting my spirits. Next time, try lifting the box.\nRaj: Please hurry.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): I don\xe2\x80\x99t need a treadmill.\nHoward: The doctor says you need to get exercise.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): I get plenty of exercise.\nHoward: Crushing my will to live isn\xe2\x80\x99t exercise.\nRaj: If she isn\xe2\x80\x99t gonna use it, then why are we doing this?\nHoward: She\xe2\x80\x99ll use it. All I need is to rig it with a fishing pole and a HoneyBaked Ham.\nRaj: All right. Now what?\nBernadette: We set it up in Howie\xe2\x80\x99s old room.\nRaj: Do you know how to set it up?\nHoward: Please, I\xe2\x80\x99m an MIT-trained engineer. I think I can handle\xe2\x80\xa6 Ma, look out.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Aaaaah! I told you this thing would kill me.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The apartment.\nRaj: So she\xe2\x80\x99s gonna be laid up for at least six weeks.\nLeonard: Poor Mrs. Wolowitz.\nAmy: Should we do something for her?\nSheldon: I know. Let\xe2\x80\x99s go see the new Spider-Man movie.\nAmy: Sheldon, we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about your friend\xe2\x80\x99s mother. She got hurt.\nSheldon: I thought that subject had run its course, so I changed it. It\xe2\x80\x99s called reading the room, Amy.\nPenny: Hi.\nLeonard: Hey, how were things on the set?\nPenny: Uh, pretty good, actually.\nRaj: So the movie\xe2\x80\x99s not as bad as you thought?\nPenny: Oh, no, it is, but I decided instead of complaining about it, I\xe2\x80\x99m just gonna go in every day and give it my all.\nAmy: Good for you.\nPenny: Thanks. There\xe2\x80\x99s no reason why I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be the best bisexual go-go dancer slowly transforming into a killer gorilla anyone\xe2\x80\x99s ever seen.\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. The bisexual gorilla go-go dancer in Schindler\xe2\x80\x99s List is tough to beat.\nSheldon: Ah, very good. Because a gorilla go-go dancer of any sexual preference would be out of place in a film about the Holocaust.\nLeonard: It only gets funnier when you explain it, Sheldon.\nSheldon: I know.\nScene: Mrs Wolowitz\xe2\x80\x99s house.\nHoward: Okay, she\xe2\x80\x99s all settled in the guest room.\nBernadette: Maybe we should get one of those machines to help her up the stairs.\nHoward: You mean a forklift?\nBernadette: Howie.\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. I just can\xe2\x80\x99t deal with this right now.\nBernadette: Taking care of your own mother? How can you say that?\nHoward: Bernie, she\xe2\x80\x99s gonna be off her feet for six to eight weeks. Are you prepared to feed her, wash her and take her to the toilet?\nBernadette: I would do it for my mother.\nHoward: Yeah, of course you would, you\xe2\x80\x99re a loving person. I\xe2\x80\x99m what my people would call a putz.\nBernadette: Look, I\xe2\x80\x99m not crazy about the idea, but what other choice do we have?\nHoward: We get a nurse. Preferably someone from a third world country who\xe2\x80\x99s used to suffering and unpleasant smells.\nBernadette: You\xe2\x80\x99d hire a total stranger to take care of the woman who raised you? That\xe2\x80\x99s so cruel.\nHoward: Not if we pay them well and let them listen to the music of their homeland.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): I need to tinkle.\nHoward: Sounds like a job for a loving person. Would you like me to play some Polish music while you carry her to the toilet?\nBernadette: You are a putz.\nHoward: As advertised.\nScene: A cinema.\nSheldon: Thanks for coming with me.\nRaj: Thanks for inviting me after everyone else said no. Aren\xe2\x80\x99t you gonna get 3-D glasses?\nSheldon: I brought my own. No sense in risking bridge-of-nose herpes.\nRaj: Is that a real thing?\nSheldon: Well, until they invent nose condoms, I\xe2\x80\x99m not finding out.\nRaj: Emily, Hey.\nEmily: Oh, hey, Raj.\nRaj: Uh, this is my friend, Sheldon. Sheldon, this is Emily.\nSheldon: Oh, yes, you\xe2\x80\x99re the dermatologist. I went for a walk yesterday without sunscreen. Do you see anything on my forehead that I should be concerned about?\nEmily: Um, you know what? I better go. My movie\xe2\x80\x99s about to start.\nRaj: Are you here alone?\nEmily: No, not really.\nRaj: What do you mean, not really?\nMan: Hey, should we get our seats?\nEmily: Yeah. It was nice seeing you. Um, I\xe2\x80\x99ll call you later.\nRaj: Yeah, okay.\nSheldon: That was awkward, right?\nRaj: Uh-huh.\nSheldon: Is it because she\xe2\x80\x99s dating you but was out with that other fellow?\nRaj: Yes.\nSheldon: Good. I thought she saw something on my forehead.\nScene: The movie set.\nDirector: And action.\nWil Wheaton: Please don\xe2\x80\x99t shut me out.\nPenny: Go away. Just go away.\nWil: I swear, I will find a way to turn you back.\nPenny: What gave you the right to mix my DNA with that of a killer gorilla?\nWil: I was trying to save your life.\nPenny: Life? What life? Look at me, I\xe2\x80\x99m a monster. And now I have blood on my hands, or paws. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\nWil: You can\xe2\x80\x99t give up. I love you.\nPenny: I love you, too. But I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid I love killing more. Like, one day, I might actually try and kill you.\nDirector: And cut. All right. All right, let\xe2\x80\x99s set up for the next scene.\nPenny: Actually, you know what? Can we do one more? I think I could do it better.\nDirector: Let\xe2\x80\x99s just move on. No one cares.\nPenny: Well, I care. I mean, look, if we\xe2\x80\x99re gonna do this, why not try and make it something we\xe2\x80\x99re actually proud of?\nDirector: Look, sweetie, this movie is garbage, but you should be happy about that, \xe2\x80\x99cause if it was a good movie, you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be in it.\nLeonard: Whoa, whoa, hang on. There\xe2\x80\x99s no need to insult her.\nDirector: And who are you?\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m her boyfriend.\nDirector: Isn\xe2\x80\x99t she too hot for you?\nLeonard: A little, yeah.\nDirector: Well, boyfriend, get off my set.\nPenny: You can\xe2\x80\x99t do that. He\xe2\x80\x99s with me.\nDirector: You know what? You can get off my set, too. You\xe2\x80\x99re fired.\nPenny: What? You can\xe2\x80\x99t fire me. I\xe2\x80\x99m the star. I\xe2\x80\x99m the girl that goes bananas. It says so on the poster.\nDirector: Yeah, but we just shot the last scene where we see your face. So from now own, the star of the movie is whoever wears this.\nWil: Hey, if you\xe2\x80\x99re gonna fire her, then you have to fire me, too.\nScene: A bar.\nWil: Wow, that fell apart really fast.\nScene: The apartment.\nRaj: Thanks for skipping the movie. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t sit in that theatre for two hours wondering about Emily and that guy.\nSheldon: Oh, quite all right. After my forehead melanoma scare I\xe2\x80\x99ve learned not to sweat the small stuff. Well, sorry, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have all the ingredients to make chai tea.\nRaj: You don\xe2\x80\x99t have to make me anything.\nSheldon: No, I do. You\xe2\x80\x99re upset about Emily and you\xe2\x80\x99re Indian. I need to make you chai tea. Now, I have all the ingredients except cardamom seeds. Do you happen to have any on you?\nRaj: Sorry, I left them in my turban.\nSheldon: Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99ll make English breakfast tea. They destroyed your culture. That\xe2\x80\x99s close enough. You know, I\xe2\x80\x99m curious, why are you so upset about seeing Emily with another man?\nRaj: Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you be upset if you saw Amy out with someone else?\nSheldon: Can\xe2\x80\x99t happen. We have an ironclad relationship agreement which precludes her from physical contact with anyone other than me.\nRaj: But you don\xe2\x80\x99t have sex with her, either.\nSheldon: Slick, huh?\nRaj: To be truthful, Emily and I haven\xe2\x80\x99t dated that long, and we never agreed to be exclusive to each other.\nSheldon: Have you had intercourse?\nRaj: No.\nSheldon: Well, stick to your guns. There will be a lot of pressure.\nScene: Mrs Wolowitz\xe2\x80\x99s house.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): I\xe2\x80\x99m hungry again.\nHoward: It\xe2\x80\x99s like the world\xe2\x80\x99s fattest cuckoo clock.\nBernadette: You know, you\xe2\x80\x99re always talking about having a baby someday. This is exactly what it\xe2\x80\x99s gonna be like.\nHoward: No, it\xe2\x80\x99s not.\nBernadette: Come on. The constant fussing, eating, pooping, burping, drooling. We\xe2\x80\x99re even waiting for the day when she can finally walk on her own.\nHoward: Maybe you\xe2\x80\x99re right. Anything she finds on the floor goes right in her mouth.\nBernadette: I\xe2\x80\x99m just telling you now, if we do have kids, don\xe2\x80\x99t expect me to do all the work.\nHoward: Hey, I\xe2\x80\x99m a very paternal person. I\xe2\x80\x99d be excellent at taking care of a baby.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): I\xe2\x80\x99m still hungry.\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m coming, you big baby.\nScene: The bar.\nPenny: You know, the only thing worse than doing a movie where they glue monkey hair to your ass is getting fired from a movie where they glue monkey hair to your ass.\nWil: Forget it, man, it\xe2\x80\x99s crap. You just move on to the next thing.\nPenny: Yeah, well, it\xe2\x80\x99s easy for you to say. You used to be famous.\nWil: Hey. I just lost a job for you.\nPenny: All right, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, you\xe2\x80\x99re famous.\nWil: Penny, it\xe2\x80\x99s not about being famous. It\xe2\x80\x99s about the art. It\xe2\x80\x99s about the passion we have for our craft. (Text message tone) I have an audition for Sharknado 2. If I book this, I am totally gonna pay you back for this beer.\nPenny: God, what am I doing with my life?\nLeonard: You having second thoughts about acting?\nPenny: You were on set, you saw what it was like.\nLeonard: Yeah, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not always that bad.\nPenny: Oh, really?\nLeonard: What about when you did, uh, Anne Frank at that cute little theater?\nPenny: It was over a bowling alley.\nLeonard: Yeah, but there was ample parking.\nPenny: Are you done?\nLeonard: And you were so good in the TV commercial.\nPenny: It was for haemorrhoid cream.\nLeonard: And I got itchy and swollen just watching you.\nPenny: Leonard, you are really not cheering me up.\nLeonard: Come on. How can you be sad when you\xe2\x80\x99re going home with all five-foot-six of this?\nPenny: Hmm. You think you\xe2\x80\x99re five-foot-six, that\xe2\x80\x99s funny.\nScene: The apartment.\nRaj: I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand it. I\xe2\x80\x99m a nice guy, I have a great job, I\xe2\x80\x99m well-educated, come from a good family. Why don\xe2\x80\x99t women want to be with me?\nSheldon: An interesting question. Well, good night.\nRaj: What? Don\xe2\x80\x99t send me home. I can\xe2\x80\x99t be alone right now.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s your problem. You can\xe2\x80\x99t be alone.\nRaj: What do you mean?\nSheldon: How many women have you had dates with?\nRaj: Eleven.\nSheldon: How many of those women did you think would become your perfect companion?\nRaj: Eleven. Wait. Do I count the 200-pound Sailor Moon girl that Howard and I had a threesome with at Comic Con?\nSheldon: Sure.\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99ll stick with eleven. She liked Howard better.\nSheldon: Well, now do you see the problem?\nRaj: Maybe. I, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.It\xe2\x80\x99s late, I should, I should go. Look, I do get what you\xe2\x80\x99re saying. Instead of desperately clinging to any woman who will go out with me, I need to work on my fear of being alone.\nSheldon: I was trying to suggest chemical castration, but it\xe2\x80\x99s my bedtime, so whatever gets you out the door. Good night.\nScene: Mrs Wolowitz\xe2\x80\x99s house.\nBernadette: Howie, I\xe2\x80\x99m back!\nHoward: Shh, I just got her to sleep.\nBernadette: Sorry.\nHoward: What took you so long? The grocery store is a few blocks away.\nBernadette: They only had regular yoghurt. I had to go to a different store to get the extra-fat kind your mom likes.\nHoward: Then why do I smell coffee on your breath?\nBernadette: So what? After two days of taking care of her, excuse me for stopping to get a mocha.\nHoward: A mocha? Well, it must be nice to be queen.\nBernadette: Queen? I\xe2\x80\x99ve been killing myself here.\nHoward: Well, whose fault is that? I wanted to get a nurse, but you were all, I\xe2\x80\x99m nice, I want to take care of people.\nBernadette: I\xe2\x80\x99m glad I got that mocha. And you know what else I\xe2\x80\x99m glad about? I bought you a brownie and I ate it in the car.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Howard.\nHoward: Thanks a lot. Now I have to go rub her belly again.\nScene: Raj\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nRaj: Hey.\nEmily: Thanks for letting me come over.\nRaj: Of course. Please, come in.\nEmily: I just wanted to say how sorry I am about tonight, and I want to make sure that we\xe2\x80\x99re okay.\nRaj: Uh, look, you and I haven\xe2\x80\x99t made any commitments to each other.\nEmily: I know. I just felt like I needed to explain. The guy I was with did my last tattoo, and he\xe2\x80\x99s been asking me out for months. I finally said yes just to get it over with.\nRaj: It\xe2\x80\x99s okay.\nEmily: Really?\nRaj: Well, I mean, yeah, it freaked me out a little, but that\xe2\x80\x99s my issue, not yours.\nEmily: Wow. If I saw you out with another woman, I\xe2\x80\x99d be pretty upset.\nRaj: Thank you. Not just for being upset, but for believing that could happen.\nEmily: Just so you know, I\xe2\x80\x99m not seeing anyone else.\nRaj: Well, me, neither.\nEmily: Okay.\nRaj: Okay. Please. So, uh, you, you have tattoos?\nEmily: Yeah.\nRaj: I don\xe2\x80\x99t. I have a hole in my belly button that may or may not have been a piercing.\nEmily: That\xe2\x80\x99s cool.\nRaj: It\xe2\x80\x99s a piercing. So, uh, how many tattoos?\nEmily: One on my shoulder, one not on my shoulder and one really not on my shoulder.\nRaj: It\xe2\x80\x99s, uh, been a long time since I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen a girl\xe2\x80\x99s really not her shoulder.\nEmily: Well, how about you show me your piercing and I show you my tattoos?\nRaj: But, uh, before I take my shirt off, I just need like ten minutes to do some crunches.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nPenny: Oh, my God. What a day.\nLeonard: Can I get you anything?\nPenny: No. I need to start making some smart decisions.\nLeonard: With your career?\nPenny: With my life.\nLeonard: Like what?\nPenny: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. We could get married.\nLeonard: Come on, be serious.\nPenny: I am.\nLeonard: Why? Because I\xe2\x80\x99m a, a smart decision?\nPenny: Well, yeah.\nLeonard: So I\xe2\x80\x99m like a bran muffin.\nPenny: What? No, that\xe2\x80\x99s not what I\xe2\x80\x99m saying.\nLeonard: No, it\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what you\xe2\x80\x99re saying. I\xe2\x80\x99m the boring thing you\xe2\x80\x99re choosing because I\xe2\x80\x99m good for you.\nPenny: What does it matter? The point is, I\xe2\x80\x99m choosing you.\nLeonard: Well, it matters a lot. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be a bran muffin. I, I want to be a Cinnabon, you know? A strawberry Pop-Tart. Something you\xe2\x80\x99re excited about even though it could give you diabetes.\nPenny: Sweetie, you can be any pastry you want.\nLeonard: No, no. No, it\xe2\x80\x99s too late. I\xe2\x80\x99m your bran muffin. Probably fat-free and good for your colon.\nPenny: You know what? Forget it. I never should\xe2\x80\x99ve brought it up.\nLeonard: You know I want to marry you, but you\xe2\x80\x99re only doing this because you got fired and you\xe2\x80\x99re feeling sorry for yourself.\nPenny: Okay, it may look that way, but getting fired from that movie was the best thing that could have happened to me, okay? I finally realize I don\xe2\x80\x99t need to be famous or have some big career to be happy.\nLeonard: Then what do you need?\nPenny: You, you stupid Pop-Tart.\nLeonard: Oh. Then I guess I\xe2\x80\x99m in.\nPenny: Really? You guess you\xe2\x80\x99re in?\nLeonard: Not like, I guess I\xe2\x80\x99m in. Like I guess, I\xe2\x80\x99m in!\nPenny: Okay. Leonard: Cool.\nLeonard: So is that it? Are, are we engaged?\nPenny: Yeah, I think so.\nLeonard: All right.\nPenny: What\xe2\x80\x99s wrong?\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure. Just feels a little anticlimactic.\nPenny: Yeah, it kind of does, huh?\nLeonard: Oh, I know. This might help.\nPenny: Where did you get a ring?\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99ve had it for a couple years, not important. Penny, will you marry me?\nPenny: Oh, my God, yes.\nLeonard: This would have been so much more romantic if you didn\xe2\x80\x99t have monkey hair on your finger.\nScene: Mrs Wolowitz\xe2\x80\x99s house.\nHoward: How you feeling?\nBernadette: Last night was a little rough, but I think we\xe2\x80\x99re gonna get through this.\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m proud of us.\nBernadette: Me, too.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Where\xe2\x80\x99s my pancakes?!\nForeign Nurse: Coming, Mrs. Wolowitz!\nBernadette: You were right.\nHoward: Welcome to Team Putz.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
