b'Scene: The apartment\nSheldon: Why hast thou forsaken me, O deity whose existence I doubt?\nPoliceman: Here. Breathe into this bag.\nLeonard: What\xe2\x80\x99s going on?\nSheldon: They stole everything, Leonard, everything.\nPoliceman: Are you the roommate?\nLeonard: Yeah, Leonard Hofstadter. What happened?\nPoliceman: Your friend here called 911 to report a robbery.\nLeonard: Oh, my God, what did they get?\nSheldon: What didn\xe2\x80\x99t they get? They got my enchanted weapons, my vicious gladiator armour, my wand of untainted power, and all my gold.\nLeonard: You called the police because someone hacked your World of Warcraft account?\nSheldon: What choice did I have? The mighty Sheldor, level 85 blood elf, hero of the Eastern kingdoms, has been picked clean, like a carcass in the desert sun. Plus, the FBI hung up on me.\nPoliceman: Into the bag.\nSheldon: They took my battle ostrich.\nLeonard: Oh, no, not Glenn?\nSheldon: Yes, Glenn! The only bird I ever loved.\nPoliceman: Good luck, fellas.\nLeonard: Thank you, officer.\nSheldon: Wait a minute! You\xe2\x80\x99re not going to do anything?\nPoliceman: Mr. Cooper, there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing\xe2\x80\xa6\nSheldon: Doctor Cooper.\nPoliceman: Seriously?\nLeonard: Not the kind with access to drugs.\nPoliceman: Fine. Dr. Cooper. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry for your loss, but the Pasadena Police Department doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have jurisdiction in Pandora.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s from Avatar, World of Warcraft takes place in Azeroth. Goodness gracious, how are you allowed to carry a gun? Can you at least refer me to a rogue ex-cop?\nPoliceman: What?\nSheldon: You know, one who was drummed off the force because he refused to play by the rules, and now he hires himself out to impose his own brand of rough justice?\nPoliceman: No.\nLeonard: Thank you, officer.\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s all gone. All gone.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m really sorry, Sheldon.\nSheldon: What kind of world do we live in, where a man would take another man\xe2\x80\x99s battle ostrich?\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\nSheldon: This act of aggression must be met with swift and cruel ferocity. It is time to cry havoc, and let slip the dogs of war.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m on it. (On phone) Hi, Mrs. Wolowitz. Is, is Howard there? Okay, thanks. That particular dog of war will have to call you back after his bath.\nSheldon: See if Raj is done with Pilates.\nCredits sequence.\n  Scene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Three thousand hours. Three thousand hours clicking on that mouse, collecting weapons and gold. It\xe2\x80\x99s almost as if it was a huge waste of time.\nHoward: Whoever did this knew what they were doing. He got in and out of your account in under 15 minutes, transferred all your stuff, and didn\xe2\x80\x99t leave a digital fingerprint.\nSheldon: Oh! There isn\xe2\x80\x99t enough camomile tea in the world to quell the rage in my heart.\nRaj: Hold on. I\xe2\x80\x99m talking to an orc under the bridge in Thunder Bluff who says if we pay him, he\xe2\x80\x99ll help us track down your things.\nSheldon: Can we trust him?\nRaj: I should say so, he appears to be a member of the Nigerian royal family.\nHoward: Whoa! Somebody\xe2\x80\x99s auctioning off a jewelled ostrich bridle!\nSheldon: No. Glenn\xe2\x80\x99s was leather. He was a simple ostrich. Is! Is, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t given up hope.\nPenny: Hey.\nLeonard: Hey, Penny. We\xe2\x80\x99re kind of in the middle of a crisis, here.\nPenny: Oh, I know. Bernadette told me. Sorry, Sheldon. I know that game meant a lot to you.\nSheldon: That game? Excuse me, Penny, but Doodle Jump is a game. Angry Birds is a game. World of Warcraft is a massively multi-player online role-playing\xe2\x80\xa6 all right, technically it\xe2\x80\x99s a game.\nRaj: Bad news, the Nigerian prince may be a fraud.\nPenny: Okay, well, anyways, I brought you a day-old cheesecake to cheer you up!\nSheldon: Stale pastry is hollow succour to a man who is bereft of ostrich.\nPenny: Just say thank you.\nSheldon: I thought I just did.\nPenny: All right. See you later.\nPriya: Oh! Hello.\nPenny: Oh, hi! I was just dropping off a cheesecake to Sheldon. He was robbed of a bunch of imaginary crap that\xe2\x80\x99s useful in a make-believe place.\nPriya: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what that means.\nPenny: Yeah, well, sadly, I do.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nPenny: Did you know last weekend Priya took Leonard rollerblading at the beach? Can you believe that?\nBernadette: I feel like I\xe2\x80\x99m supposed to say that bitch, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t have enough information.\nPenny: I am the one who spent two years trying to get him to even go to the beach in the first place. And he was so phobic about stepping on medical waste, I had to carry him to the water.\nBernadette: I took Howard to the beach once. He almost burst into flames like a vampire.\nPenny: So what\xe2\x80\x99s the thanks I get for turning Leonard into quality boyfriend material? I have to tiptoe around his new girlfriend.\nAmy: I think you\xe2\x80\x99re on.\nBernadette: Oh. That bitch!\nPenny: Want some coffee liqueur on your ice cream?\nAmy: Ah, here\xe2\x80\x99s the alcohol and drug peer pressure Mother warned me about. I was starting to think it was never going to happen. Yes, please.\nPenny: You guys should\xe2\x80\x99ve seen Leonard when I first met him. There was no eye contact. He was either looking up at the ceiling, or down at his shoes.\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99m drunk.\nPenny: You know, for the first couple of months, whenever I would take off my bra, he would giggle and say, oh boy, my breast friends.\nBernadette: Well, if it makes you feel any better, I\xe2\x80\x99m never speaking to Priya again.\nPenny: No, don\xe2\x80\x99t do that. No reason to be mean to her.\nAmy: This may be the alcohol talking, but I believe there is. Are you familiar with the recent study of Tanzanian chimpanzees by Nishida and Hosaka out of Kyoto University?\nPenny: No, but I can name all the Kardashians.\nAmy: Primates, such as ourselves, have a natural instinct to ostracize ill-mannered members of the troop. Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s urge to shun, scowl or fling her waste at Priya is hard-wired into her DNA.\nBernadette: I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an urge to fling my waste.\nAmy: Believe me, it\xe2\x80\x99s there, we all have it. Hit me with some more booze, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll show you.\nScene: The apartment\nHoward: All right, here we are, this is the tavern where all the black-market weapon trades go down.\nRaj: I don\xe2\x80\x99t think my character should be in a place like this. Everyone\xe2\x80\x99s undressing her with their eyes.\nHoward: Maybe if you stop dropping your sword and bending over to pick it up.\nLeonard: Okay, what exactly are we looking for?\nHoward: Redheaded troll, goes by the name of Glumly. According to the message boards, if you want to move stolen goods and it\xe2\x80\x99s after school hours, he\xe2\x80\x99s your guy.\nPriya: Leonard, is this going to take much longer? I thought we were going to spend some time together.\nLeonard: Uh, we are. In the meantime, you\xe2\x80\x99re welcome to whip up a quick character and join us.\nPriya: Seriously?\nLeonard: Well, you have to put in a credit card number, but it\xe2\x80\x99s fun.\nPriya: Maybe I should just go home.\nHoward: Our troll just walked in! I got him!\nLeonard: We got him. We\xe2\x80\x99re almost done.\nHoward: So, how do you guys want to play this?\nSheldon: Be ruthless. You tell him if he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t start talking, we\xe2\x80\x99ll register a complaint with his Internet service provider.\nRaj: Sheldon, what if he gets his Internet from his cable company? He could lose his HBO and all their delightful original programming.\nSheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t care! I\xe2\x80\x99m losin\xe2\x80\x99 it, man!\nLeonard: Why don\xe2\x80\x99t we play this smart? Try a little good goblin, bad goblin.\nPriya: Oh, dear Lord.\nHoward: Nah, I think we have to be more subtle.\nRaj: Okay, I see where this is going. Fine, I\xe2\x80\x99ll have sex with him.\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99s not where it was going.\nRaj: Good, because I would hate that.\nPriya: Leonard, you\xe2\x80\x99re busy, let\xe2\x80\x99s talk tomorrow.\nLeonard: Oh, wait. Hang on. Are you upset?\nPriya: No, no, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s sexy to date a boy trapped in a man\xe2\x80\x99s body.\nLeonard: Good, good. I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what happens.\nSheldon: And people think I don\xe2\x80\x99t get sarcasm.\nScene: The hallway.\nAmy: Well, well, well. Look who it is.\nPenny: Okay, be nice.\nPriya: Hello.\nPenny: Hi. We\xe2\x80\x99re just heading out for a drink.\nAmy: Because I do that now.\nBernadette: Count your blessings you\xe2\x80\x99re not a Tanzanian chimp.\nPriya: What?\nPenny: Don\xe2\x80\x99t listen to her, she\xe2\x80\x99s had a lot of ice cream. Do you want to join us?\nPriya: Oh, thank you, but I have work to do.\nAmy: Four women walk down the stairs, how many reach the lobby?\nScene: The cafeteria.\nLeonard: Did your sister say anything when you got home last night?\nRaj: Oh, no, don\xe2\x80\x99t put me in the middle of this. I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to be your go-between.\nLeonard: Come on, help me out. Am I in trouble?\nRaj: There\xe2\x80\x99s no reason to worry.\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99s a relief.\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99m sure many women in happy relationships spend their nights skyping with their ex-boyfriend Sanjay.\nHoward: Good news, gentlemen, I found our hacker.\nSheldon: What?\nLeonard: Really?\nHoward: Yeah. No one can hide from me, not Waldo, not Carmen San Diego, not even topless Natalie Portman.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99ve never said these words before, but good job, Howard!\nHoward: Thanks. Our culprit is one Mr. Todd Zarnecki, 2711 Ocean View Road, Carlsbad, California.\nSheldon: The name and the address drip with evil.\nRaj: What else do we know about him?\nHoward: Well, quite a bit, actually.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99ll bet he\xe2\x80\x99s some loser who lives with his parents.\nHoward: Yes, he does live with his parents. Here\xe2\x80\x99s a Google Earth shot of their house.\nSheldon: Excellent! It\xe2\x80\x99s in a cul-de-sac. We can box him in.\nLeonard: Hold on, you\xe2\x80\x99re thinking of going there?\nSheldon: Carlsbad is only a couple of hours away.\nLeonard: Fine. You walk up to the house, knock on the door and demand your stuff back. What if he says no?\nSheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if you\xe2\x80\x99ve been following the news, Leonard, but there have been some terrific advancements in the field of torture.\nLeonard: No one\xe2\x80\x99s getting tortured.\nSheldon: Fine, we\xe2\x80\x99ll abide by the Geneva Convention. But ask yourself this, in the course of our lives, how much lunch money has been taken from us? How many kites? How many Scooby-Doo Trapper Keepers?\nRaj: I totally had one of those.\nSheldon: Of course you did. It was a fun and practical way of organizing your school work. But the bullies took it from us. Well, no more. Tonight, we take back our dignity, our birthright and our pride. What do you say? Who\xe2\x80\x99s with me?\nRaj: I have a hip-hop aerobics class at five, could we go after?\nSheldon: Sure.\nHoward: Also, tonight\xe2\x80\x99s the Sabbath and my mother and I have a tradition of lighting the candles and\nwatching Wheel of Fortune, so If we could leave at eight, we\xe2\x80\x99d still be able to regain our birthright at ten, ten thirty latest.\nSheldon: Fine. Leonard?\nLeonard: Oh, geez, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if I can ditch Priya two nights in a row.\nRaj: Oh, come on, man. Bros before\xe2\x80\xa6 my sister.\nLeonard: Aw, screw it. I\xe2\x80\x99m in.\nRaj: Me, too.\nHoward: And me.\nSheldon: One moment. (Places a tissue on their hands before adding his own) I\xe2\x80\x99m hell-bent on catching a cyber criminal, not the common cold.\nScene: Howard\xe2\x80\x99s house\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, I thought this delay was so you could watch Wheel of Fortune with your mother.\nHoward: I am. She\xe2\x80\x99s just bleaching her moustache. Check it out. Hey, Ma! Before and After! Four words, 17 letters, two N\xe2\x80\x99s, one V.\nHoward\xe2\x80\x99s Mother (off): Fanny pack of wolves.\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99s incredible.\nHoward: Yeah, she\xe2\x80\x99s kind of a Wheel savant.\nLeonard (phone rings): Uh-oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s Priya.\nRaj: Sitar music for her ringtone is not cool, dude.\nLeonard: Hit the\xe2\x80\xa6 Hey, sweetie. Yeah, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna be working late. I, I, I miss you, too. Okay, sure, I\xe2\x80\x99ll call you when I get home. Okay, bye-bye.\nRaj: Very nice. You lie to my sister.\nHoward: That\xe2\x80\x99s the nicest thing he does to your sister.\nRaj (phone rings): Oh, guess who.\nLeonard: Cover for me.\nRaj: Hello, Priya. What\xe2\x80\x99s up? How would I know if Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s at work or not? Don\xe2\x80\x99t be suspicious. Look, if you want your relationship with Leonard to continue, you\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to believe whatever wild-eyed, cockamamie excuse the white devil has the nerve to offer you. Okay? Yeah, bye-bye. You owe me.\nHoward: New puzzle, Ma. Same name. One N, two D\xe2\x80\x99s, three O\xe2\x80\x99s.\nHoward\xe2\x80\x99s Mother (off): Whoopi and Rube Goldberg!\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s uncanny.\nHoward: I know. It\xe2\x80\x99s her superpower. Well, that and jiggling her arm fat.\nScene: Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s car.\nLeonard: I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe we\xe2\x80\x99re going all the way to San Diego to confront this guy.\nHoward: Yeah, we\xe2\x80\x99re kind of bad-asses, aren\xe2\x80\x99t we?\nLeonard: Totally.\nRaj: Hey, how about we stay the night and hit Legoland in the morning?\nSheldon: Sea World is better. It has Shamu, who is literally tons of fun. But for the moment, let\xe2\x80\x99s stay focused on Todd Zarnecki.\nRaj: Yeah, we\xe2\x80\x99re coming for you, Todd Zarnecki. And for the record, Legoland is more interactive.\nSheldon: I almost feel sorry for the poor fool, sitting in his split-level suburban ranch, unaware that a vengeful horde is barrelling down the San Diego Freeway at 71 miles an hour. Ease up there, lead foot. You trying to get us killed?\nRaj: I took the liberty of burning us a mix of heroic questing music.\nSheldon: This says Beyonce Bootylicious Dance Mix.\nRaj: It\xe2\x80\x99s a re-writable CD. Just put it in.\nHoward: Beyonce? Really?\nRaj: She\xe2\x80\x99s curvy and she owns it. I like that.\nLeonard (as Ride of the Valkyries begins): Oh, yeah, I\xe2\x80\x99m feeling it.\nSheldon: We are winged fury! Which is still no excuse for going over the posted speed limit.\nScene: Stuck in a traffic tailback.\nHoward: Next time we go to kick someone\xe2\x80\x99s ass, we take the train.\nSheldon: I always prefer the train.\nScene: Outside Todd Zarnecki\xe2\x80\x99s house.\nLeonard: Sheldon, let\xe2\x80\x99s go.\nSheldon: Coming.\nHoward: Why did you bring that?\nSheldon: No weapon strikes more fear into a man\xe2\x80\x99s heart than a Klingon bat\xe2\x80\x99leth.\nLeonard: Okay, let\xe2\x80\x99s get clear on something. We\xe2\x80\x99re just going to tell this guy to transfer all of your stuff back into your account and then be on our way. No one\xe2\x80\x99s bat\xe2\x80\x99lething anybody.\nSheldon: So my blade shall not taste blood tonight?\nLeonard: No.\nSheldon: Well, now I just feel silly holding it.\nLeonard: Come on.\nSheldon: Can I at least kick down the door?\nLeonard: You\xe2\x80\x99re welcome to try, but the other day, it took you 15 minutes to get into a FedEx box. (Rings bell)\nVoice Inside: Who is it?\nSheldon: Your doom!\nRaj: Don\xe2\x80\x99t say your doom. Who opens the door for their doom?\nSheldon: Good point. Basket of puppies.\nHuge man (opening door): What?\nLeonard: Uh, Sheldon?\nSheldon: Are you Todd Zarnecki?\nTodd: Yeah. Who are you?\nSheldon: I am Sheldor of Azeroth. I want my things back.\nTodd: I don\xe2\x80\x99t think so. Let me see that.\nSheldon: Careful. That\xe2\x80\x99s a collectible.\nTodd: I know. I\xe2\x80\x99ve always wanted one. (Closes door)\nSheldon: Well, he\xe2\x80\x99s even more cunning than we thought.\nScene: Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s car.\nSheldon: You know, the joke\xe2\x80\x99s on him. Without the certificate of authenticity, that bat\xe2\x80\x99leth is worthless.\nHoward: Yeah, he walked right into our trap.\nRaj: Legoland seems like a hollow dream now.\nLeonard: Oh-oh.\nRaj: What\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\nLeonard: Something\xe2\x80\x99s wrong, I\xe2\x80\x99m not getting any gas. Anybody know anything about internal combustion engines?\nSheldon: Of course.\nRaj: Very basic.\nHoward: 19th-century technology.\nLeonard: Does anybody know how to fix an internal combustion engine?\nSheldon: No.\nHoward: No, not a clue.\nLeonard: Well, we\xe2\x80\x99d better call somebody to come pick us up.\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99d be swell if they had a train.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s car.\nSheldon: Thank you, Penny.\nPenny: No problem. So, Leonard, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s interesting you didn\xe2\x80\x99t call your girlfriend to come get you.\nLeonard: Uh, I kind of told her I was working.\nPenny: So you lied to her. Also interesting.\nLeonard: Yeah, she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t really understand the whole Warcraft adventure-role-playing thing.\nPenny: Well, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter if she gets it, as long as she\xe2\x80\x99s pretty.\nHoward: This one\xe2\x80\x99s funny, Leonard. How come you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t make it work with her?\nPenny: So did you at least get Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s fake stuff back?\nSheldon: No. We failed in our noble quest.\nPenny: How come?\nSheldon: Todd Zarnecki was mean.\nPenny: All right. Hang on.\nLeonard: What are you doing?\nPenny: I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna show you how we finish a quest in Nebraska. Oh. Beyonce. (Ride of the Valkyries) This ain\xe2\x80\x99t no Beyonce.\nScene: Todd Zarnecki\xe2\x80\x99s house. Todd answers the door.\nTodd: Now what?\nPenny: Give my friend his stuff back.\nTodd: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about.\nPenny: Well, then, good news. Today\xe2\x80\x99s the day a girl\xe2\x80\x99s finally going to touch you in your little special place. (Kicks him in the groin) Now give him his stuff back.\nTodd: Okay.\nSheldon: We did it! I said, we.\nScene: The lobby.\nPriya: Oh, hold the door.\nPenny: Oh, hi.\nPriya: Hi.\nPenny: Going to see Leonard?\nPriya: Yes. How have you been?\nPenny: Fine. You?\nPriya: Very well, thank you.\n(They ascend all three flights of stairs in silence.)\nPenny: Alright, well great seeing you.\nPriya: Yeah, you too.\nPenny: Amy\xe2\x80\x99s right. I do want to fling my poop at her.\nAdvertisements'
