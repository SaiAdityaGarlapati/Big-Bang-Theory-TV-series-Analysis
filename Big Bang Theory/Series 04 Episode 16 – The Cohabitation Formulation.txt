b'Episode begins with a \xe2\x80\x9cPreviously on\xe2\x80\x9d sequence before first scene.\nScene: Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom.\nHoward: What\xe2\x80\x99s so funny?\nBernadette: Nothing. Just thinking about the noises people make during sex.\nHoward: I do sometimes get a bit carried away, don\xe2\x80\x99t I?\nBernadette: It\xe2\x80\x99s cute. You sound a little like a drunken monkey. Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh!\nHoward: You know it\xe2\x80\x99s meant as a compliment.\nBernadette: That\xe2\x80\x99s how I take it.\nHoward: This is perfect. I hope this moment never ends.\nBernadette: Me too.\nHoward: Well, gotta go.\nBernadette: Oh! Already? Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you stay over?\nHoward: Well, I\xe2\x80\x99d love to, but you know my mother needs me in the morning.\nBernadette: Please, I think the woman can manage to put a wig on by herself.\nHoward: It\xe2\x80\x99s not just the wig. It\xe2\x80\x99s pinning her hair up, drawing on her eyebrows. It\xe2\x80\x99s a two-person job.\nBernadette: It\xe2\x80\x99s just, when you leave right after we make love, it makes me feel cheap.\nHoward: Oh, honey, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. What can I do?\nBernadette: Stay.\nHoward: Okay. Like, what, another five, ten minutes?\nBernadette: Go home.\nHoward: Your call.\nBernadette: Howard, have you ever considered us living together?\nHoward: Boy, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. You, me, Ma living under the same roof?\nBernadette: No, I mean just you and me. You can move in here, or we can find a place.\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a better solution.\nBernadette: What?\nHoward: We wait for my mom\xe2\x80\x99s heart to explode from all the salt she eats. Then we just stick her in the ground, flip her mattress and move into the big bedroom.\nBernadette: Great.\nHoward: Look at us planning a future together.\nScene: Outside Howard\xe2\x80\x99s house.\nMrs Wolowitz (voice): Who\xe2\x80\x99s there? Are you a sex criminal?\nHoward: Sex criminals don\xe2\x80\x99t have keys, Ma.\nMrs Wolowitz: Where were you so late?\nHoward: I was out with Bernadette.\nMrs Wolowitz: I know what that means, I watch Dr. Phil. I hope to God you used a condom!\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m not having this conversation with you, Ma!\nMrs Wolowitz: God forbid you get one of those new fancy sex diseases!\nHoward: Nobody has a disease!\nMrs Wolowitz: I hope not. I share a toilet with you. Is that what you want? To give your mother herpes?\nHoward: That\xe2\x80\x99s it. I don\xe2\x80\x99t have to take this. Good luck with your eyebrows in the morning!\nMrs Wolowitz: Who\xe2\x80\x99s there? Are you a sex criminal?\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m still leaving! I just forgot my Claritin.\nCredits sequence.\n  Scene: The apartment.\nLeonard: Hey, what\xe2\x80\x99s up?\nHoward: I need a place to crash.\nLeonard: Uh, sure. Why?\nHoward: Big fight with my mother.\nLeonard: Still arguing over which CSI is the best?\nHoward: No, we agreed they all have their merits. This was about Bernadette.\nSheldon: What\xe2\x80\x99s going on?\nLeonard: Howard\xe2\x80\x99s gonna sleep here tonight. He had a fight with his mother.\nSheldon: Did you offer him a hot beverage?\nLeonard: No.\nSheldon: Leonard, social protocol states when a friend is upset, you offer them a hot beverage, such as tea.\nHoward: Tea does sound nice.\nSheldon: You heard the man, Leonard. And while you\xe2\x80\x99re at it, I\xe2\x80\x99m upset that we have an unannounced houseguest, so make me cocoa. Point of inquiry, given that Leonard is your secondary friend and Koothrappali is your primary friend, why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you seek refuge under his roof?\nHoward: There\xe2\x80\x99s no room. His sister is staying with him.\nLeonard: Wait, wait. What?\nSheldon: Cocoa, Leonard. Focus. I\xe2\x80\x99m down in the dumps here.\nLeonard: Priya\xe2\x80\x99s in town?\nHoward: Yeah, some work thing. Anyway, my mother seems to think that Bernadette\xe2\x80\xa6\nLeonard: Hold on. When did Priya get here?\nHoward: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. A couple of days ago. The thing is, Bernadette doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like that I have to take care of my mother, and my mother doesn\xe2\x80\x99t trust Bernadette.\nLeonard: Yeah, that\xe2\x80\x99s a real pickle. Bye.\nSheldon: Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry. As your tertiary friend, I am prepared to step in and comfort you.\nHoward: That\xe2\x80\x99s not really necessary.\nSheldon: No, no. I\xe2\x80\x99ll finish making the tea, while you narcissistically ramble on about whatever\xe2\x80\x99s troubling you.\nHoward: Thanks.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s what tertiary friends are for.\nScene: Raj\xe2\x80\x99s Apartment. Leonard knocks on the door.\nRaj (inside): Who is it?\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s Leonard.\nRaj: You can\xe2\x80\x99t come in.\nLeonard: I just want to talk to her.\nRaj: I forbid it.\nPriya: Open the door, Rajesh.\nRaj: You heard me. I forbidded it.\nPriya: Forbidded it?\nRaj: Forbaded it?\nPriya: Get out of the way. What are you doing here?\nLeonard: What are you doing here?\nPriya: I have business in Los Angeles.\nLeonard: Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you call?\nRaj: Clearly, she was sending you a message to take a hike, Mike.\nPriya: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. I thought about calling, but I just wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure if seeing you was such a good idea.\nLeonard: I know. Last time I came on too strong. Can we talk in private?\nRaj: No!\nPriya: Sure.\nRaj: It\xe2\x80\x99s completely inappropriate for a single woman to entertain a man in private. If you insist on talking, you must do it on the couch! All right, you may talk in the bedroom, but I want this door to remain open! All right, just this once you may close the door. But keep in mind I\xe2\x80\x99ll be right out here monitoring the situation! (Dials phone) Oh, damn it. Leonard, when you get this message, call me. (Dials again) Priya, this is your brother. When you get this, tell Leonard to check his voicemail.\nScene: The Cheesecake Factory.\nSheldon: Would you be sleeping over again this evening? Because you\xe2\x80\x99re welcome to.\nHoward: That\xe2\x80\x99s very nice of you, but I made other plans.\nSheldon: Well, just keep in mind that should you ever need a slightly apathetic tertiary friend, I stand at the ready.\nPriya: Hi, Howard. Hi, Sheldon.\nHoward: Hey.\nSheldon: Hello.\nRaj: Why are you holding hands? I forbid you to hold hands.\nPriya: Rajesh, you know Leonard and I spent the night together.\nRaj: Yeah, but you were just sleeping, because I forboded you to have sex.\nLeonard: The word is forbade.\nRaj: Are you sure? That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t sound right.\nPriya: Listen, Rajesh, Leonard and I have decided to see each other again, and you don\xe2\x80\x99t get to tell me who I can and can\xe2\x80\x99t have a relationship with.\nSheldon: Actually, he can. The Hindu Code of Manu is very clear in these matters. If a woman\xe2\x80\x99s father is not around, the duty of controlling her base desires falls to the closest male member of her family, in this case, Raj. The code also states that if she disobeys, she will be reborn in the womb of a jackal and tormented by diseases. If true, that seems like an awfully large gamble given that the prize is Leonard.\nRaj: There it is, Priya. We\xe2\x80\x99re Indian. We believe this stuff.\nPriya: I think it also says that if you eat beef, you need to live with cows for three months and drink their urine.\nRaj: Some of it makes sense, some of it\xe2\x80\x99s crazy. My point is, you can\xe2\x80\x99t go out with Leonard.\nPenny (arriving): Who can\xe2\x80\x99t go out with Leonard?\nRaj: My sister.\nLeonard: Penny, this is Raj\xe2\x80\x99s sister, Priya.\nPriya: It\xe2\x80\x99s very nice to meet you.\nPenny: Oh, yeah, you, too.\nSheldon: Priya, if you\xe2\x80\x99re experiencing any tension or awkwardness, it may stem from the fact that Leonard and Penny used to, if I may quote Howard, do the dance with no pants.\nPenny: Sheldon!\nLeonard: Really?\nHoward: Hey, Bernadette, can I talk to you for a second?\nBernadette: Sure.\nRaj: Penny, you became disenchanted with Leonard as a lover. Would you please tell my sister why?\nHoward: Listen, my mom\xe2\x80\x99s going to Palm Springs to visit her sister. That\xe2\x80\x99s two whole nights in a row I can sleep over with you all the way to morning. Unless the desert air dries out her sinuses, in which case I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to schlep out there with the big humidifier.\nBernadette: That\xe2\x80\x99s it? That\xe2\x80\x99s your big solution to all of our problems? If your mom\xe2\x80\x99s nose holds up, we get two nights together?\nHoward: Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that great?\nBernadette: No, it\xe2\x80\x99s not great. You need to make a choice. Me or your mother.\nHoward: Oh, uh\xe2\x80\xa6\nBernadette: Wrong answer.\nHoward: No, wait. You didn\xe2\x80\x99t let me finish.\nBernadette: I\xe2\x80\x99m listening.\nHoward: Uh\xe2\x80\xa6\nBernadette: Agh!\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment. (groans)\nAmy: I came as quickly as I could.\nPenny: Okay. Why?\nAmy: To comfort you, of course. Sheldon told me about Leonard dating Rajesh\xe2\x80\x99s sister. So I high-tailed it over here to pick up the pieces of your broken heart.\nPenny: Amy, I\xe2\x80\x99m fine.\nAmy: You don\xe2\x80\x99t have to be strong for me. Now let\xe2\x80\x99s talk about Priya, that man-stealing bitch.\nPenny: What?\nAmy: In situations like this, best girlfriends are often catty about the other woman. Rawr.\nPenny: Really, I am not upset about Leonard and Priya.\nAmy: Oh. Then perhaps you don\xe2\x80\x99t understand what\xe2\x80\x99s going on. Your former boyfriend has replaced you with what appears to be a very suitable mate. Arguably much more suitable than you.\nPenny: Oh. Well, good for him. Hey, what do you mean, more suitable?\nAmy: Well, granted, Penny, your secondary sexual characteristics are reasonably bodacious. But Priya is highly educated, she\xe2\x80\x99s an accomplished professional, and she comes from the culture that literally wrote the book on neat ways to have sex. Whereas you, on the other hand, are a community college dropout who comes from the culture that wrote the book on tipping cows.\nPenny: Yeah. Okay, I got it. I got it. So, what is all that stuff?\nAmy: This is a portable electroencephalogram. I\xe2\x80\x99m doing research on emotions and brain activity. So when you start crying, I can see which region of the brain is activated. Then I\xe2\x80\x99m going to stimulate the analogous area in the brain of a rhesus monkey and see if he cries. Cool, huh?\nScene: Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s apartment. Howard knocks on door.\nHoward: I choose you.\nBernadette: Really?\nHoward: Yep. I moved out of my mother\xe2\x80\x99s house. Cord is cut. I\xe2\x80\x99m all yours.\nBernadette: What did she say when you told her?\nHoward: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. She hasn\xe2\x80\x99t responded to my email yet.\nBernadette: This is so great. I love you, Howard.\nHoward: I love you, too. So what\xe2\x80\x99s for dinner?\nBernadette: Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t really have much of anything in the house.\nHoward: That\xe2\x80\x99s fine. Why don\xe2\x80\x99t we go fool around in our bedroom? And then you can go shopping.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: I thought maybe after we eat, we could see an early movie.\nPriya: I\xe2\x80\x99d love that.\nLeonard: I love the way you say, I\xe2\x80\x99d love that.\nRaj: She says it the same way I do. I\xe2\x80\x99d love that. Everybody in India says it that way. It\xe2\x80\x99s not a big deal.\nPriya: Rajesh, don\xe2\x80\x99t be a child.\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99m not being a child. Leonard, I swear to God, if your sister ever comes to town, I shall have my way with her.\nLeonard: My sister\xe2\x80\x99s 38 and married.\nRaj: All the more shame that will fall upon the house of Hofstadter.\nPenny: Ooh, I thought I smelled pizza.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s remarkable. If pepperoni were an explosive substance, you could replace German shepherds at our nation\xe2\x80\x99s airports.\nPriya: Hi. Penny, right?\nPenny: Oh, yes. Hi, hi. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know you had company. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to impose.\nSheldon: No, no. It\xe2\x80\x99s not an imposition. At this point, in our ecosystem, you are akin to the plover, a small scavenging bird that eats extra food from between the teeth of crocodiles. Please, fly into our open maw, and have at it.\nPenny: If I had more than a box of baking soda in my refrigerator, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have to take that.\nAmy: Hi, bestie.\nPenny: Hi. So, um, Priya, you\xe2\x80\x99re a lawyer, right?\nPriya: I know. Pretty boring, huh?\nLeonard: Oh, come on. It\xe2\x80\x99s not boring at all. She\xe2\x80\x99s currently helping set up a secondary derivative market which would allow overseas car firms to hedge their investments against potential advancements in battery technology. Hmm?\nPriya: Thank you, Leonard. That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make it sound boring at all.\nAmy: So, how you holding up?\nPenny: I\xe2\x80\x99m fine.\nAmy: Oh, who are you kidding? She\xe2\x80\x99s breathtaking.\nPriya: So, Penny, Leonard tells me you\xe2\x80\x99re an actress. That must be pretty exciting.\nPenny: Oh, yeah, yeah. It\xe2\x80\x99s real great. Today I drove to Van Nuys for an audition I thought was going to be for a cat food commercial. Turned out to be porn.\nSheldon: Did you get the part?\nPenny: I didn\xe2\x80\x99t do the audition.\nSheldon: Given the state of your career, can you really afford to be picky?\nPriya: I took acting classes when I was at Cambridge. I loved it. We did Taming of the Shrew.\nLeonard: Oh, wow. I love Taming of the Shrew. I did a paper on it in high school. Who knows not where a wasp does wear his sting? In his tail.\nPriya: In his tongue.\nLeonard: Whose tongue?\nPriya: Yours, if you talk of tails, and so farewell.\nLeonard: What, with my tongue in your tail?\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99m regretting my earlier cattiness. She is an absolute delight.\nScene: Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom.\nBernadette: Wow.\nHoward: Wow, indeed.\nBernadette: I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe we\xe2\x80\x99re finally living together.\nHoward: Yeah. You know what would make this moment perfect?\nBernadette: What?\nHoward: A little snack. You got any string cheese?\nBernadette: No. I, I might have some cheddar.\nHoward: Not as good. You can\xe2\x80\x99t make strings with it. Remind me to put it on your shopping list.\nBernadette: Okay.\nHoward: You have hypo-allergenic detergent?\nBernadette: No.\nHoward: Better put it on the list. If you wash my underwear with regular soap, I get little red bumps on my tuchus.\nBernadette: Wait a second. I\xe2\x80\x99m doing your laundry?\nHoward: Well, honey, it\xe2\x80\x99s not gonna do itself. Oh, before I forget, tomorrow morning, you\xe2\x80\x99re driving me to the dentist.\nBernadette: I have to take you?\nHoward: You don\xe2\x80\x99t have to take me. You get to take me.\nBernadette: Wait a minute. Are you telling me your mother usually takes you to the dentist?\nHoward: It\xe2\x80\x99s not weird. There\xe2\x80\x99s lots of kids there with their moms.\nBernadette: I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe this.\nHoward: What? It\xe2\x80\x99s fun. If I have no cavities, afterwards, we go out for a treat.\nBernadette: All right, Howard, let\xe2\x80\x99s get something straight right now. I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to be your mother.\nHoward: Whoa, whoa, whoa! Where did that come from?\nScene: Howard\xe2\x80\x99s house.\n  Mrs Wolowitz (off): Who\xe2\x80\x99s that? Is it a sex criminal?\nHoward: Nobody wants to do that to you, Ma.\nMrs Wolowitz: Where were you?\nHoward: Didn\xe2\x80\x99t you read my email?\nMrs Wolowitz: You know I can\xe2\x80\x99t turn on that ferkakta computer. I left you some brisket on the kitchen counter.\nHoward: Thank you.\nMrs Wolowitz: Remember to floss after. We have the dentist in the morning!\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\n  Penny: Oh, hey. What\xe2\x80\x99s up?\nAmy: I just wanted to check in on you.\nPenny: Why?\nAmy: It seems like the appropriate thing to do when one\xe2\x80\x99s best friend finds herself replaced by a smart, beautiful woman with the smouldering sexuality of a crouched Bengal tiger.\nPenny: I already told you, I\xe2\x80\x99m okay with it. I mean, if anything, I\xe2\x80\x99m quite pleased (starting to blub) that Leonard has found someone (starting to blub) that makes him so happy.\nAmy: It\xe2\x80\x99s okay, it\xe2\x80\x99s okay.\nPenny: Thank you.\nAmy: Now, let\xe2\x80\x99s get these electrodes attached and see what\xe2\x80\x99s going on in that pretty little noggin of yours.\nPenny: Okay.\nScene: The apartment.\nPenny: I smell Chinese food.\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s actually Thai. You\xe2\x80\x99re slipping.\nPenny: Are Leonard and Priya here?\nSheldon: They went to Catalina for the weekend.\nPenny: Oh. Where\xe2\x80\x99s Raj?\nSheldon: At home, forbidding it.\nPenny: How about Howard?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m given to understand his mother grounded him for running away.\nPenny: Oh, okay. Well, I guess it\xe2\x80\x99s just the two of us, huh?\nSheldon: Actually, it\xe2\x80\x99s the three of us.\nAmy (on webcam): What up, bestie? Good news. Thanks to you, I was able to make a rhesus monkey cry like a disgraced televangelist.\nPenny: Great.\nAmy: So, you feeling better?\nPenny: Not really.\nAmy: Sheldon, you have a guest who\xe2\x80\x99s upset.\nSheldon: Right. I\xe2\x80\x99ll make tea.\nPenny: Oh, sweetie, it\xe2\x80\x99s okay. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want tea.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. It\xe2\x80\x99s not optional.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
