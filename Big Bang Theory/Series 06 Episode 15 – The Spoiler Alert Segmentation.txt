b'Scene: The apartment\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why I avoided the Harry Potter books for so long. These are great. I just started number six.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s a good one. Dumbledore dies in that one. Yeah, I know, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see it coming, either.\nLeonard: Why would you say that?\nSheldon: You brought up the subject. I contributed an interesting fact on that subject. It\xe2\x80\x99s called the art of conversation. Okay, your turn.\nLeonard: That was a huge spoiler.\nSheldon: Good.\nLeonard: What is wrong with you? If I did that, you\xe2\x80\x99d bitch about it for weeks.\nSheldon: Oh, really, Leonard? Are you going to have another one of your hissy fits?\nLeonard: Hissy fits? I have hissy fits?\nSheldon: Yes, and I have a theory why. Because of your lactose intolerance, you switched over to soy milk. Soy contains estrogen-mimicking compounds. I think your morning Cocoa Puffs are turning you into a hysterical woman.\nLeonard: You are unbelievable. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why I put up with you. You\xe2\x80\x99re controlling, you\xe2\x80\x99re irritating.\nSheldon: There you go again, nag, nag, nag. You\xe2\x80\x99re only proving my point, little lady.\nLeonard: You know what? Screw you, Sheldon. You are the most annoying person I have ever met.\nSheldon: What? I\xe2\x80\x99m annoying? You criticize my behaviour all the time. Sheldon, don\xe2\x80\x99t talk about your bowel movements over breakfast. Sheldon, when the president of the university is giving a eulogy at a funeral, don\xe2\x80\x99t yawn and point at your watch. Sheldon, don\xe2\x80\x99t throw away my shirts \xe2\x80\x99cause you think they\xe2\x80\x99re ugly. You\xe2\x80\x99re impossible.\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99s it. I don\xe2\x80\x99t, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have to put up with this.\nSheldon: Actually, I have your signature on a roommate agreement that says you do.\nLeonard: Aw. Here\xe2\x80\x99s what I think of your roommate agreement.\nSheldon: You pick that up right now.\nLeonard: No.\nSheldon: Roommate agreement, section 27, paragraph 5, the roommate agreement, like the American flag, cannot touch the ground.\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t care. I don\xe2\x80\x99t have to do anything you say because I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I want to live here anymore.\nSheldon: Where are you going?\nLeonard: To live with Penny and not you, you crazy bastard.\nSheldon: Crazy bastard?\nLeonard: Yes.\nSheldon: Leonard, wait.\nLeonard: What?\nSheldon: Dobby the elf dies in book seven.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nRaj: Here you go.\nHoward: Great. Come on in.\nRaj: What, you don\xe2\x80\x99t say thank you?\nHoward: It\xe2\x80\x99s my suitcase. I lent it to you two years ago.\nRaj: Well, then, I should tell you I broke the wheel and the handle. So, is everyone from Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s company going to Vegas?\nHoward: No, just me, her and a couple of the big wigs. It\xe2\x80\x99s part of a bonus she got.\nRaj: Cool. Did she discover a cure for something?\nHoward: Not exactly. They spent a ton of money developing this dandruff medication that had the side effect of horrible anal leakage.\nRaj: Is there a good anal leakage?\nHoward: Anyway, it was Bernie\xe2\x80\x99s idea to rebrand the stuff as a cure for constipation.\nRaj: Way to make lemonade. You know, from around the corner where fudge is made.\nHoward: Hey, I got a favour to ask.\nRaj: Sure.\nHoward: My mom\xe2\x80\x99s been kind of an emotional wreck since that dentist she was dating dumped her.\nRaj: Dumped her? What, did he use a forklift? Sorry. There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing funny about morbid obesity.\nHoward: She\xe2\x80\x99s huge. It was funny. Anyway, I was just hoping that maybe you could check in on her tomorrow night and make sure she\xe2\x80\x99s doing okay.\nRaj: Dude, I\xe2\x80\x99m a single man. Saturday night is my party night.\nHoward: Really? What do you got going on?\nRaj: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, maybe drive down to Hollywood, hit a few hot spots, see if I can get lucky.\nHoward: Yeah, tell me if this sounds familiar. You pay fifteen dollars to park, you stand on the pavement for an hour until you break down and give the bouncer twenty bucks to let you in. You push your way to the bar, where you drink an eighteen dollar cosmopolitan, then you stare at a pretty girl and imagine your perfect life together. Your children, grandchildren. Meanwhile, she leaves with a guy who claims he wrote Beverly Hills Chihuahua. Then you give up on anyone ever loving you, go to Marie Callender\xe2\x80\x99s, buy a pie and eat it in your car in the parking lot.\nRaj:What time should I be at your mother\xe2\x80\x99s?\nHoward: I told her around seven.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nLeonard: I swear, that man is the most egotistical, insufferable human being I have ever met.\nPenny: Yeah, but you two make such a cute couple. Like Burt and Ernie. You guys even teach me stuff about words and numbers.\nLeonard: Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ve had it. I am done. I can\xe2\x80\x99t, I can\xe2\x80\x99t live with him for one more minute.\nPenny: Wow. Where are you going to go?\nLeonard: I was thinking here with you.\nPenny: Oh.\nLeonard: That a problem?\nPenny: No, not at all. No, it\xe2\x80\x99s, it\xe2\x80\x99s great. It\xe2\x80\x99s terrific. I, you know, I just can\xe2\x80\x99t help feel bad about Sheldon. I mean, how\xe2\x80\x99s he going to get by without you? Ernie.\nLeonard: He\xe2\x80\x99s got Amy now.\nPenny: Yeah, he does, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not the same.\nLeonard: Why?\nPenny: Um, well, um, all right. You, you know how in Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Ron didn\xe2\x80\x99t abandon Harry just because Harry started dating Ron\xe2\x80\x99s sister?\nLeonard: Harry and Ginny get together?\nPenny: Sorry. Spoiler alert. My point is, as much as I want to live with you, I can\xe2\x80\x99t do it knowing how much Sheldon needs you.\nLeonard: Please, the only thing he needs me for is to be his whipping boy, his, his stooge, his doormat.\nPenny: Well, you know what they say, if it ain\xe2\x80\x99t broke.\nLeonard: Wow. It sounds to me like you don\xe2\x80\x99t want us to live together.\nPenny: No. No, no, I do. I do. It\xe2\x80\x99s just, I mean, it\xe2\x80\x99s a really big step.\nLeonard: Is it? We\xe2\x80\x99re together all the time. Financially, it makes great sense. Can you think of one reason why we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do this?\nPenny: Well, um, I\xe2\x80\x99m just a little thirsty.\nLeonard: Yeah.\nPenny: I got nothing.\nLeonard: Great. I\xe2\x80\x99ll go get my stuff.\nPenny: Yeah. Okay, all right, don\xe2\x80\x99t freak out. You can make this work.\nLeonard: Oh, could you clear off a shelf for me in the bathroom? I take a lot of medicine.\nPenny: Oh, please let some of it be Xanax.\nScene: Mrs Wolowitz\xe2\x80\x99s house.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Are you ready for dessert?\nRaj: No, thank you, Mrs. Wolowitz. As it is, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to have to carry my stomach out of here like I\xe2\x80\x99m a fireman rescuing an infant.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Oh, please. You\xe2\x80\x99re a tall glass of brown water. Have dessert.\nRaj: Well, I, I really couldn\xe2\x80\x99t. But, uh, I\xe2\x80\x99ve had a lovely time eating your brisket and hearing about the things you\xe2\x80\x99ve had removed from your body over the years. Didn\xe2\x80\x99t know you could have a cyst inside another cyst.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): The doctor said they were like Russian nesting dolls. Well, if you have to go, how about I put a little doggie bag together for you?\nRaj: That would be lovely. Thank you. (Sound of crying) Mrs. Wolowitz, uh, are you okay?\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Don\xe2\x80\x99t mind me. I just cry when I\xe2\x80\x99m lonely and have nothing to live for.\nRaj: I, uh, I suppose I could stay for some dessert.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Great. You like chocolate chip cheesecake?\nRaj: Sure.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): I\xe2\x80\x99ll make one.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: One vintage Mr. Mxyzptlk action figure. That\xe2\x80\x99s Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s.\nAmy: Children\xe2\x80\x99s toy.\nSheldon: One Star Trek: The Next Generation phaser. That\xe2\x80\x99s Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s.\nAmy: Children\xe2\x80\x99s toy.\nSheldon: One Game of Thrones collector\xe2\x80\x99s edition Longclaw sword. Oh, Leonard and I bought that together. That\xe2\x80\x99s a bit of an ethical conundrum. Eh, I\xe2\x80\x99ll keep it.\nAmy: So, uh, what\xe2\x80\x99s your plan moving forward?\nSheldon: Uh, suppose I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to find and cultivate a new roommate. What a task that will be. Do you know how uncivilized Leonard was when I took him in?\nAmy: No.\nSheldon: Oh, it took me forever to get him on a bathroom schedule. He would just go whenever the mood struck him.\nAmy: Like a dog-boy.\nSheldon: Exactly.\nAmy: What if you could find a roommate who was a scientist and already familiar and comfortable with your ways?\nSheldon: That would be ideal. If a person like that existed, I would sign on, no further questions asked.\nAmy: Great. Here I am!\nSheldon: Wait. Here who is where?\nAmy: Me. Aren\xe2\x80\x99t I your perfect roommate?\nSheldon: Um\xe2\x80\xa6\nAmy: Think about it, Sheldon. I\xe2\x80\x99m not a stranger, we\xe2\x80\x99re intellectually compatible, I\xe2\x80\x99m willing to chauffeur you around town, and your personality quirks, which others find abhorrent or rage-inducing, I find cute as a button. What do you think?\nSheldon: Um\xe2\x80\xa6\nAmy: Tell me one reason why this isn\xe2\x80\x99t a fantastic idea.\nSheldon: Um\xe2\x80\xa6\nAmy: See? You can\xe2\x80\x99t. I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna go see if Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s room is big enough for my water bed.\nSheldon: Um\xe2\x80\xa6\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Good buddy Leonard. (Knock, knock, knock) Good buddy Leonard. (Knock, knock, knock) Good buddy Leonard.\nLeonard: What do you want?\nSheldon: Hey, good buddy. So, uh, I was just talking to Amy, and she made me realize that this little dust-up between you and me is much ado about nothing.\nLeonard: Is that so?\nSheldon: Yes. All is forgiven, so come back home. I\xe2\x80\x99ll make you some soy hot chocolate, and then I\xe2\x80\x99ll you tell you about our exciting new devil-may-care bathroom policy.\nLeonard: Cut to the chase, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Okay. Amy\xe2\x80\x99s decided she wants to move in with me, so I need you to come back home, you lovable scamp. That\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of product.\nPenny: Hey. What\xe2\x80\x99s going on?\nLeonard: Oh, get this, suddenly, Sheldon wants me back because Amy wants to move in with him.\nPenny: Really? Interesting.\nLeonard: Well, too late, pal. I\xe2\x80\x99m not going anywhere. Penny and I are very happy living together. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that right?\nPenny: It\xe2\x80\x99s like the happiness won\xe2\x80\x99t ever leave the apartment.\nSheldon: Leonard, please. You know Amy moving in marks a level of intimacy our relationship isn\xe2\x80\x99t ready for.\nPenny: Yes. That is a real thing. And it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean you don\xe2\x80\x99t care about each other, it just means things are moving at a pace you\xe2\x80\x99re not comfortable with, and that\xe2\x80\x99s fine.\nLeonard: Well, if he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to live with her, then he should tell her how he feels.\nPenny: Well, maybe he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know how to say it without hurting her feelings.\nSheldon: Feelings? What am I, a hippie at a love-in? No. The problem is, she laid out a series of logical arguments that I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t refute.\nPenny: That is the worst, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\nSheldon: Yes.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, Sheldon. I can\xe2\x80\x99t help you. Oh, spoiler alert, this door\xe2\x80\x99s about to slam in your face.\nAmy: Oh, there you are. When do I get a key to our apartment?\nSheldon: Um\xe2\x80\xa6\nScene: Howard\xe2\x80\x99s old bedroom. A phone is ringing.\nRaj: Hello?\nHoward: Hey. How\xe2\x80\x99d it go last night with my mom?\nRaj: Okay, I guess.\nHoward: What time did you leave?\nRaj: Actually, I\xe2\x80\x99m still here.\nHoward: What? You spent the night?\nRaj: Yeah. Uh, after dinner, we watched a rerun of Rockford Files, and then she opened a bottle of, uh, cream sherry, and the next thing I know, she was tucking me into your bed.\nHoward: You wore my pyjamas?\nRaj: Mm-hmm. How do you sleep in these things? Silk pajamas on satin sheets? I slid out of the bed, like, three times.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Rajesh! You up? You ready for breakfast?\nRaj: Oh, boy. Breakfast.\nHoward: Okay, Raj, listen to me. You need to get out of there.\nRaj: But I have a cream sherry hangover and I smell blintzes.\nHoward: If you don\xe2\x80\x99t leave now, she\xe2\x80\x99ll use food and guilt to keep you there for the rest of your life.\nRaj: Oh, Howard, stop.\nHoward: Trust me, you\xe2\x80\x99re not Jewish. That\xe2\x80\x99s how they get you.\nRaj: You\xe2\x80\x99re being silly. I can leave whenever I want.\nHoward: Oh, really? Where are your clothes and your shoes?\nRaj: They\xe2\x80\x99re on the chair, right over\xe2\x80\xa6 Oy vey.\nScene: The stairwell.\nSheldon: Hello, home wrecker.\nPenny: What did I do?\nSheldon: You gave Leonard somewhere to go. Thanks to you, Amy\xe2\x80\x99s out buying his and hers bath towels. Like I\xe2\x80\x99d ever dry myself with something that has a possessive pronoun on it.\nPenny: Okay. Listen, the truth is I don\xe2\x80\x99t want him living with me.\nSheldon: Great. Kick him out. Break his heart. Everybody wins.\nPenny: No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to break his heart. I love him. This is just happening too fast.\nSheldon: You think this is fast? It\xe2\x80\x99s just a matter of time before I see Amy\xe2\x80\x99s leg stubble in my shower.\nPenny: Yeah, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen those legs. You might want to get some Drano.\nSheldon: Hold on. If you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to live with Leonard, why don\xe2\x80\x99t you just tell him?\nPenny: Well, you know how he is. He\xe2\x80\x99s sensitive and emotional.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s because he drinks too much soy milk.\nPenny: Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what else we can do but tell them the truth.\nSheldon: I suppose there\xe2\x80\x99s no choice but to face the crying, angry accusations and the high-pitched wails of despair.\nPenny: Yeah. And who knows how Amy will react.\nScene: A hotel room.\nHoward: Here\xe2\x80\x99s some more ice.\nBernadette: Oh, thanks.\nHoward: What were we thinking? We should have just done it the regular way.\nBernadette: Those Chinese acrobats in Cirque du Soleil made it look so easy.\nHoward: Honestly, if I could bend that far, what would I need with you?\nBernadette: If you could bend that far, you\xe2\x80\x99d be doing us both a favour. (Phone)\nHoward: Hey, Raj. What\xe2\x80\x99s up?\nRaj: You were right. I can\xe2\x80\x99t get out of here.\nHoward: You\xe2\x80\x99re still at my mother\xe2\x80\x99s?\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99m trapped. My clothes have been in the laundry all day, and she hid my keys. I think they might be in her bra, because she jingles when she walks. What do I do?\nHoward: Hey, you wanted a woman in your life. Now you got one.\nRaj: Come on, Howard, help me.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Rajesh, tatellah, I ran you a bath.\nRaj: Oh, my God. She\xe2\x80\x99s not gonna bathe me, is she?\nHoward: Gee, I wish I could tell you no. All right, well, thanks again for helping me out.\nRaj: But, Howard\xe2\x80\xa6\nBernadette: Should we go back and rescue him?\nHoward: It\xe2\x80\x99s too late. We\xe2\x80\x99ll see him at his Bar Mitzvah.\nScene: The apartment.\nAmy: Here you go. I picked up the Chinese food just the way Leonard used to.\nSheldon: Is it kung pao chicken?\nAmy: Yes.\nSheldon: Brown rice, not white rice?\nAmy: Yes.\nSheldon: Spicy mustard from the Korean deli?\nAmy: Yes. I did good, right?\nSheldon: Yes. Amy, are you worried that us living together will take the mystery out of our relationship?\nAmy: No.\nSheldon: Yeah, why would you?\nAmy: Oh, and, uh, check this out. I took the liberty of scripting a new outgoing voice mail message for both of us.\nSheldon: Hello. This is Sheldon.\nAmy: And this is Amy.\nSheldon: We\xe2\x80\x99re not home right now.\nAmy: \xe2\x80\x98Cause we out dropping science, son.\nTogether: Leave a message.\nAmy: Beep.\nSheldon: You can\xe2\x80\x99t live here.\nAmy: What? Why? Is it the message? I only used urban slang to sound tough so people wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t break in.\nSheldon: No. It\xe2\x80\x99s not the message.\nAmy: Well, what is it, then? I did everything just the way you like it.\nSheldon: You did.\nAmy: Then what the hell, Sheldon? We have been going out for over two years, and I have been nothing but patient with you. I watch your dopey space movies. I signed your ridiculous contract. I even stopped wearing lip gloss \xe2\x80\x99cause you said it made my mouth look too slippery. I am the best girlfriend you\xe2\x80\x99re ever gonna have. You give me one good reason why I can\xe2\x80\x99t live here.\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s Penny\xe2\x80\x99s fault.\nAmy: What?\nSheldon: She doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to live with Leonard, so he has to come live here again. She\xe2\x80\x99s the snake in our garden. She\xe2\x80\x99s the reason we can\xe2\x80\x99t be happy.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nPenny: Hey, Ames.\nAmy: Yeah. Hey, Ames, nothing. I was all set to move in with Sheldon, and now I hear I can\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x99cause you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to live with Leonard.\nLeonard (off): What?\nPenny: Sheldon, what did you say?\nSheldon: I said the truth. You don\xe2\x80\x99t want to live with Leonard, and you know it.\nLeonard: Since when don\xe2\x80\x99t you want to live with me?\nPenny: Oh, don\xe2\x80\x99t get all huffy. You\xe2\x80\x99re the one who decided to move in without even asking me if I was ready.\nSheldon: Yeah, I think we should talk about that.\nPenny: And since you love the truth so much, why don\xe2\x80\x99t you tell Amy you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to live with her instead of blaming it on me?\nSheldon: I thought we were talking about the other thing.\nAmy: You\xe2\x80\x99re a coward.\nSheldon: Well, the evidence does support that.\nPenny: Come on, Amy, let\xe2\x80\x99s go drink wine and talk about what jerks our boyfriends are.\nAmy: You know what would show them? I should move in here with you.\nPenny: Um\xe2\x80\xa6\nSheldon: Do you want to catch up on some Walking Dead?\nLeonard: \xe2\x80\x98Kay.\nSheldon: Have you seen the one where Lori dies?\nLeonard: No.\nSheldon: Or maybe she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t. Let\xe2\x80\x99s find out.\nScene: Mrs Wolowitz\xe2\x80\x99s house. Raj is climbing out of the window.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Where you going?\nRaj (screams): No!\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
