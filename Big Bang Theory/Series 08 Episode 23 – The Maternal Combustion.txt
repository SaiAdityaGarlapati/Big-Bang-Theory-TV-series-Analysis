b'Scene: The apartment.\nPenny: Leonard, what time does your mom\xe2\x80\x99s plane get in?\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, some time tomorrow morning.\nPenny: Don\xe2\x80\x99t you want to know for sure?\nLeonard: No need to. As soon as she flies into California airspace, I\xe2\x80\x99ll feel a disturbance in the Force.\nAmy: It\xe2\x80\x99s so nice both of your moms are coming in to see you guys get an award.\nSheldon: Well, my mother\xe2\x80\x99s been there for every honour I\xe2\x80\x99ve won since I beat out my twin sister for the did it on the potty trophy. How does this look?\nPenny: Aw, it\xe2\x80\x99s so nice. She\xe2\x80\x99s gonna love it.\nAmy: Sure, his mom gets roses. When I want them, they\xe2\x80\x99re a bouquet of severed plant genitals.\nSheldon: You act like I didn\xe2\x80\x99t get you that mushroom log on Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s Day.\nAmy: He\xe2\x80\x99s right. Roses die, but a moist rotting log will pump out mushrooms for two or three magical years.\nPenny: You know, your mom\xe2\x80\x99s never been too thrilled with our relationship. Maybe I should get her something so she warms up to me.\nLeonard: If you could run out and get a PhD, that might make her like you.\nPenny: Really? It didn\xe2\x80\x99t work for you.\nAmy: Do you think the moms will get along?\nLeonard: Uh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. They\xe2\x80\x99re pretty different.\nSheldon: Maybe they\xe2\x80\x99ll be best friends. One of them is brilliant, one is sweet and simple. Sound familiar?\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The apartment.\nMrs Cooper: Shelly, I\xe2\x80\x99m so proud of you and Leonard for getting this award.\nSheldon: Oh, thank you, Mother.\nMrs Cooper: I tried to read your paper, but it was very hard for me to understand.\nSheldon: Oh, it\xe2\x80\x99s quite straightforward, actually. It describes a new model of the universe that conceptualizes it as the surface of an n-dimensional superfluid.\nMrs Cooper: Interesting. You can believe that, but God filling an ark with animals two-by-two is nonsense.\nSheldon: What did they feed the lions, Mother?\nMrs Cooper: The floating bodies of drowned sinners, of course.\nSheldon: Listen, Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s mom is a renowned psychiatrist and woman of science. Can you please keep the Bible babble to yourself while she\xe2\x80\x99s here?\nMrs Cooper: Are you ashamed of me?\nSheldon: Of course not. I love you. I\xe2\x80\x99m just embarrassed by the things you believe, do and say.\nMrs Cooper: Well, I love you, too. My little bowl of lion chow.\nScene: The stairwell.\nDr Hofstadter: So, have you and Penny set a wedding date?\nLeonard: No, we\xe2\x80\x99re kind of taking it slow.\nDr Hofstadter: I see.\nLeonard: What does that mean?\nDr Hofstadter: You\xe2\x80\x99ve been on and off with this woman for seven years and engaged for one year. One has to wonder if there\xe2\x80\x99s a problem. Are you having satisfactory intercourse?\nLeonard: Yes, Mother.\nDr Hofstadter: Only satisfactory. I see.\nLeonard: I change my answer. It, it\xe2\x80\x99s amazing. It\xe2\x80\x99s hot. We can barely keep our hands off each other.\nDr Hofstadter: Seems odd to try and impress your mother with your sexual prowess. But then, you always did have that unresolved Oedipal complex.\nLeonard: See, this right here, what you\xe2\x80\x99re doing, can you please not do that around Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s mom?\nDr Hofstadter: Why? Are you attracted to her, too?\nLeonard: Of course not. She\xe2\x80\x99s, she\xe2\x80\x99s just a very sweet and God-fearing lady, and you have to be respectful of her beliefs.\nDr Hofstadter: Leonard, I\xe2\x80\x99m an adult. I know how to conduct myself around people from different walks of life.\nLeonard: Thank you.\nDr Hofstadter: Where is she from again?\nLeonard: East Texas.\nDr Hofstadter: Ugh.\nLeonard: Hey, look who\xe2\x80\x99s here.\nSheldon: Oh, Doctor Hofstadter, it\xe2\x80\x99s so good to see you again.\nDr Hofstadter: Likewise. I read your paper, it was very impressive.\nSheldon: Oh, thank you.\nLeonard: We just spent two hours in traffic. Did you think to mention to me that you liked our paper?\nDr Hofstadter: Of course I did, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a mother\xe2\x80\x99s job to make sure her child\xe2\x80\x99s self-esteem is not dependent on anyone\xe2\x80\x99s approval.\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99s so sweet, you think I have self-esteem.\nSheldon: Doctor Hofstadter, I want you to meet my mother, Mary.\nDr Hofstadter: : So nice to meet you.\nMrs Cooper: Nice to meet you, too. How was your flight?\nDr Hofstadter: Very pleasant. And yours?\nMrs Cooper: Lovely. Almost as if someone, not saying who, was watching over the plane.\nDr Hofstadter: You\xe2\x80\x99re kidding, right?\nLeonard: Subtle, mom, real subtle.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s house.\nBernadette: Stuart.\nStuart: Morning.\nBernadette: We talked about this. I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind you still living here, but we got to have some rules. And rule number one is pants.\nHoward: Hey.\nScene: The apartment.\nMrs Cooper: You must be very proud of your son.\nDr Hofstadter: Oh, yes. He recently argued a case before the Supreme Court.\nMrs Cooper: He did?\nDr Hofstadter: Oh, you mean this son. Uh, sure, he\xe2\x80\x99s terrific.\nSheldon: Beverly, would you like to see the math I worked out to support our hypothesis?\nLeonard: You mean, my hypothesis. I hypothesized it all by myself.\nDr Hofstadter: Calm down, dear. Mary, I\xe2\x80\x99m curious. When did you first realize that your son had such a remarkable mind?\nSheldon: Ooh, good question. Everyone loves stories about Sheldon Cooper, boy genius.\nMrs Cooper: Well, I would have to say when he was 13 and tried to build a nuclear reactor in the tool shed.\nSheldon: Ooh, this is a good one.\nMrs Cooper: Now, the first thing you have to know about Shelly is ever since he was a little boy, he was always concerned with the well-being of others. And he didn\xe2\x80\x99t think that it was fair for people to pay for electricity, so he was gonna power the entire town for free.\nSheldon: Tell her about the uranium. Tell her about the uranium.\nMrs Cooper: Oh, well. Oh, this is adorable. When he arranged to get some yellowcake from Chad, I thought he was talking about Twinkies from one of his friends.\nSheldon: But I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t. \xe2\x80\x98Cause I didn\xe2\x80\x99t have any friends.\nMrs Cooper: No. It turns out that this little scallywag was trying to use my Visa card to buy uranium from an African warlord in the country of Chad.\nDr Hofstadter: Sounds like Sheldon was a handful.\nMrs Cooper: Oh, he was a handful.\nSheldon: I was a handful.\nLeonard: You still are. Uh, Mom, hey, tell Mary the story about how I made a Van der Graaf generator out of our vacuum cleaner.\nDr Hofstadter: All right. He broke the vacuum cleaner.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s house.\nHoward: I mean, for a while, everything was vampires. Now it\xe2\x80\x99s all zombies. I wonder what the next monster fad will be.\nRaj: We haven\xe2\x80\x99t had a good invisible man in a while.\nStuart: Clearly, you\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen me try to talk to a woman.\nBernadette: Guys. In the time you\xe2\x80\x99ve been sitting here playing video games, I got the car washed, picked up cleaning supplies and went to the bank.\nStuart: I put on pants.\nHoward: Kiss-ass.\nBernadette: Okay, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know when I became the mother to three lazy teenagers, but it stops today. You guys are cleaning the kitchen, top to bottom.\nRaj: Hey, I don\xe2\x80\x99t even live here.\nBernadette: Yes or no, do you have clothes in my laundry right now?\nRaj: I do. And some of it\xe2\x80\x99s wool, so dry flat if possible.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Oh, and here\xe2\x80\x99s a picture of me receiving my bachelor of science degree.\nDr Hofstadter: You don\xe2\x80\x99t look very happy.\nSheldon: Well, I had just begun puberty. It was figuratively and literally one of the hairiest moments of my life.\nMrs Cooper: Shelly does not like change.\nSheldon: Oh, true. But all the clenching in the world will not keep testicles in your abdomen.\nPenny: Hey, sorry, got caught up at work. Hi, Beverly.\nDr Hofstadter: Hello. Oh, okay.\nPenny: Sorry, I forgot.\nSheldon: You remember my mother.\nPenny: Oh, yes. Hi, Mary.\nMrs Cooper: Good to see you again, dear.\nPenny: Ah, yeah, now that\xe2\x80\x99s what I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about.\nLeonard: So, Mom, you haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen Penny since we got engaged.\nPenny: Oh, yeah, let me show you the ring.\nDr Hofstadter: Oh, lovely. Must have been very expensive.\nSheldon: Oh, no, not at all. No, we, uh, found a place online that, uh, repurposes diamond drill bits.\nLeonard: We did not. That\xe2\x80\x99s not true. Can I speak to you alone for a second?\nSheldon: Oh, sure.\nLeonard: It came from Tiffany\xe2\x80\x99s.\nSheldon: You mean the box, right?\nLeonard: Keep walking.\nPenny: Really doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter to me how much he spent on the ring. I think.\nSheldon: Did I misspeak about the ring?\nLeonard: Yes, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll get back to that. But, uh, even with your mother here, you are deliberately hogging all the attention from my mom. You\xe2\x80\x99re like one of those elephant seal pups that steals the milk from two mothers.\nSheldon: Do you mean what marine biologists refer to as super weaning?\nLeonard: Yes, you are a super weaner.\nSheldon: Well, now I have to correct you. As a bit of an elephant seal buff, the more accurate comparison would be when two mother seals actively seek to nourish the same pup. So I believe the term you\xe2\x80\x99re looking for is a double mother suckler.\nLeonard: Yeah, you\xe2\x80\x99re right. That is the term I\xe2\x80\x99m looking for. You are a dirty double mother suckler.\nSheldon: Okay, well, now that we have the terminology straightened out. How dare you.\nPenny: We\xe2\x80\x99re not in a rush. We\xe2\x80\x99ll set a date when the time is right.\nMrs Cooper: It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter, sweetie. The moment a man lays with a woman, they are married in the eyes of the Lord.\nDr Hofstadter: Uch.\nMrs Cooper: Uch? The bible is uch to you?\nDr Hofstadter: No, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. That was inappropriate. As a psychiatrist, I know how important people\xe2\x80\x99s superstitions can be to them.\nMrs Cooper: You want to talk about superstitions? Sheldon sent me the books you wrote, all that nonsense about superegos and ids. What bull dropped that on the barn floor?\nDr Hofstadter: His name is Sigmund Freud.\nPenny: Hey, look at that. You both believe in Jewish bearded guys.\nMrs Cooper: Stay out of this.\nPenny: Mm-hmm.\nMrs Cooper: At least the bearded man that I believe in preaches love and compassion. All yours talks about is why you hold in your poop and want to crawl back inside your mama.\nDr Hofstadter: It\xe2\x80\x99s fascinating. How can someone as enlightened as Sheldon come from someone like you?\nMrs Cooper: I know the answer. You\xe2\x80\x99re not gonna like it.\nDr Hofstadter: Try me.\nMrs Cooper: When I was pregnant with Shelly, I was driving to church, and I was praying to the Lord to give me a son smarter than his dumb-ass daddy. And I looked over and I saw a Jesus bobblehead in the Subaru next to me nodding yes. What is that supposed to mean?\nDr Hofstadter: : It means, I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe we\xe2\x80\x99re having this conversation.\nMrs Cooper: Well, do it some more. Maybe you can knock some sense into yourself.\nPenny: Why don\xe2\x80\x99t we all stop hitting ourselves and talk about something safe, you know, like shoes or how cute little Chinese babies are.\nSheldon: It is not my fault that your mother likes me better than she likes you.\nLeonard: Oh, don\xe2\x80\x99t flatter yourself. She likes everybody better than she likes me.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s house.\nRaj: How old is this Jell-O?\nStuart: Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s carrots, so gonna say very.\nHoward: Sorry we have to do this.\nStuart: Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s not wrong. She does work hard around here.\nRaj: Yeah, maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing if she stops babying you so much.\nHoward: She doesn\xe2\x80\x99t baby me.\nStuart: I saw her pull you home in a wagon.\nHoward: For your information, I twisted my ankle chasing the ice cream truck.\nRaj: Face it, dude, Bernadette treats you the same way your mother used to, and that was not a healthy relationship.\nHoward: You\xe2\x80\x99re right. It\xe2\x80\x99s time for me to act like an adult in this marriage. Starting with my husbandly duty of taking out the trash. Bernie, I made a mess.\nScene: A coffee shop.\nDr Hofstadter: I\xe2\x80\x99m terribly sorry that I upset your mother.\nSheldon: Oh, it\xe2\x80\x99s all right. She\xe2\x80\x99ll forgive you. She has to or she goes to hell.\nDr Hofstadter: I can\xe2\x80\x99t help but notice how her unconditional love for you is diametrically opposed to my own parenting strategies.\nSheldon: Well, you doled out affection as a reward for achievement, a proven way to raise a child. Or train a rat.\nDr Hofstadter: But look how well you turned out.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99d feign modesty at this point, but who would believe me? Still, you need to consider how successful Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s brother and sister are.\nDr Hofstadter: I suppose.\nSheldon: While my brother and sister are mouth-breathing idiots.\nDr Hofstadter: Do you suppose you would\xe2\x80\x99ve flourished more in a reward-based environment?\nSheldon: Perhaps. But my mom made me spaghetti with chopped-up hot dogs whenever I wanted, so who cares?\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: Not once did my mother ever give me any love or affection for just being myself, I always had to earn it.\nMrs Cooper: Oh, Leonard, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure she loves you very much. In her own cold godless way.\nPenny: Yeah, and you certainly don\xe2\x80\x99t have to earn my love.\nLeonard: Thank you.\nPenny: Of course, you already knew that when you bought me this princess-cut drill bit.\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99s not what it is.\nPenny: I know, I know. Zzzzzzzz.\nMrs Cooper: When your mom gets back, I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna need to apologize for the way I spoke to her.\nPenny: Well, come on now, she did kind of start it.\nMrs Cooper: Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter, a good Christian would\xe2\x80\x99ve turned the other cheek. On the other hand, a good Texan would\xe2\x80\x99ve shot her, so, I just kind of split the difference. Hey, who\xe2\x80\x99s in the mood for spaghetti and hot dogs?\nLeonard: Oh, me.\nPenny: Yeah, me, too.\nMrs Cooper: Coming up.\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t really feel I deserve it.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s house.\nHoward: That was a big sticky mess, but I think I got it.\nRaj: Looks good.\nStuart: Yeah.\nBernadette: Look at that. You cleaned it up all by yourself.\nHoward: Yes, I cleaned it up all by myself. Honestly, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why you complain so\xe2\x80\xa6 okay, maybe I missed one spot. Just leave.\nScene: The apartment.\nMrs Cooper: I\xe2\x80\x99m so glad that you and I were able to bury the hatchet.\nDr Hofstadter: Me, too. And I respect your right to your beliefs.\nMrs Cooper: And I will pray for you.\nLeonard: Okay, Mom, let\xe2\x80\x99s get you back to your hotel before anyone says anything else.\nDr Hofstadter: One moment. There\xe2\x80\x99s something I need to say to you.\nLeonard: Oh, really? That\xe2\x80\x99s too bad.\nDr Hofstadter: Leonard, I always made you earn my affection, but today I realize that there\xe2\x80\x99s more than one way to raise a child.\nSheldon: I taught her that.\nDr Hofstadter: Therefore, I would like to initiate a new protocol wherein I shower you with unconditional love.\nLeonard: Wow. When does that start?\nDr Hofstadter: So needy. Come to Mommy.\nPenny: It\xe2\x80\x99s okay, go ahead.\nDr Hofstadter: Oh, my son.\nLeonard: Oh, my mother.\nPenny: Oh, my God.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s house.\nStuart (singing): It\xe2\x80\x99s a hard-knock life.\nTogether (singing): It\xe2\x80\x99s the hard-knock life for us, it\xe2\x80\x99s the hard-knock life for us. \xe2\x80\x98Stead of treated, we get tricked, \xe2\x80\x98stead of kisses, we get kicked, it\xe2\x80\x99s the hard-knock life. Got no folks to speak of so it\xe2\x80\x99s the hard-knock row we hoe, cotton blankets \xe2\x80\x98stead of wool, empty bellies \xe2\x80\x98stead of full, it\xe2\x80\x99s a hard-knock life.\nAdvertisements'
