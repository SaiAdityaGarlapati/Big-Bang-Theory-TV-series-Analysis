b'Scene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Is anyone else troubled by the Spider-Man theme song?\nLeonard: Why would it trouble you? It\xe2\x80\x99s, like, your third favourite cartoon theme song.\nSheldon: It is, right behind do-do-do-do-do Inspector Gadget., and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, heroes in a half-shell.\nHoward and Raj (together): Turtle power!\nSheldon: However, the Spider-Man lyrics posit that Spider-Man, Spider-Man does whatever a spider can.\nHoward: Yeah, so?\nSheldon: I can think of many things Spider-Man can\xe2\x80\x99t do that a spider can. One, crawl in your ear and die. Two, legally leave Guatemala without a passport. Three, have sex with a spider.\nRaj: an we change the subject? Spiders give me the jeebie-jeebies.\nHoward: It\xe2\x80\x99s heebie-jeebies.\nRaj: I know, but that sounds anti-Semitic. Anyway, I was thinking we could have a little film festival tonight. The theme, movies that killed their franchises.\nLeonard: Oh. Like Jaws 4, Indiana Jones 4, Daredevil 1.\nRaj: Miss Congeniality 2: Armed and Fabulous. I mean, you know a movie\xe2\x80\x99s bad when my homegirl Sandy B can\xe2\x80\x99t save it.\nLeonard: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s working tonight, I\xe2\x80\x99m in.\nHoward: Not me. I\xe2\x80\x99m having dinner with Bernadette and her parents.\nLeonard: Fun. We know how much you love that.\nHoward: It\xe2\x80\x99s torture. Especially with her dad. We have nothing in common.\nSheldon: You know what I like to do when I\xe2\x80\x99m forced to speak with those beneath my intellectual station? I bring up an interesting topic, like the difference between Spider-Man and spiders.\nHoward: Thanks, Sheldon. I\xe2\x80\x99ll try that with my father-in-law.\nSheldon: No, you can\xe2\x80\x99t use that one. That\xe2\x80\x99s mine. Uh, try this one for an ice-breaker. Uh, despite popular lore, there is no place in the continental United States, Alaska or Hawaii from which one can dig straight through the centre of the earth and come up in China.\nHoward: Great, thank you.\nSheldon: Actually, you can\xe2\x80\x99t have that one either. It\xe2\x80\x99s too good. Sorry.\nRaj: What about you, Sheldon? Do you have any plans tonight?\nSheldon: Sadly, yes. Amy\xe2\x80\x99s taking me to a memorial service. It\xe2\x80\x99s for one of her colleagues who is of Asian descent, so my planned conversational gambit is to casually remark that no matter how deep they dig his grave, he\xe2\x80\x99ll never make his way back to China.\nLeonard: That should lighten the mood.\nSheldon: What can I say? I put the fun in funeral.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: Amy\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. Oh, right, funeral. (Knock, knock, knock) (solemnly) Amy.\nAmy: Hello, Sheldon.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m not allowed to wear my Silver Surfer neck tie, but you can wear a bathrobe?\nAmy: I think I\xe2\x80\x99m too sick to go to the funeral.\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re sick? You poor kid. Well, see ya.\nAmy: Sheldon, aren\xe2\x80\x99t you gonna take care of me?\nSheldon: Me? No. No, I\xe2\x80\x99m not that kind of doctor.\nAmy: But our relationship agreement clearly states that when one of us is sick, the other must take care of them.\nSheldon: Oh, no, I see the confusion. No, the intent behind that clause was to force you to take care of me when I\xe2\x80\x99m ill. When you\xe2\x80\x99re feeling better, you\xe2\x80\x99ll think that\xe2\x80\x99s funny.\nAmy: Never mind. Good night, Sheldon.\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. I made a commitment in writing to comfort you in times like this. Additionally, you are my girlfriend, and I care about your well-being.\nAmy: Thank you, Sheldon.\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re welcome. Now let\xe2\x80\x99s get this over with.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nHoward: So, how have you been?\nMr. Rostenkowski: Fine.\nHoward: Good. Fine is good. How you liking retirement?\nMr. Rostenkowski: It\xe2\x80\x99s fine.\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m sensing a theme. You ever really think about the Spider-Man theme song? How\xe2\x80\x99s that dinner coming?\nBernadette: I just put it in. It\xe2\x80\x99s gonna be a while.\nHoward: I like rare chicken. Let\xe2\x80\x99s do this.\nBernadette: You could die.\nHoward: Death by chicken. That\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty fowl way to go.\nMrs. Rostenkowski: Here\xe2\x80\x99s another beer, honey.\nMr. Rostenkowski: Thank you.\nHoward: So, Mrs. Rostenkowski, you took that trip to the Grand Canyon. How was it?\nMrs. Rostenkowski: It was good.\nHoward: Had no idea you were the chatty one.\nScene: Amy\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nSheldon: 102.2. Exactly what it was half an hour ago. It\xe2\x80\x99s like you\xe2\x80\x99re not even trying to get better.\nAmy: Sheldon, you don\xe2\x80\x99t get over the flu in half an hour.\nSheldon: Well, not with that attitude.\nAmy: I have to say, I\xe2\x80\x99m finding your bedside manner a little lacking.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. I just want you to get better as soon as possible. And with that goal in mind, let me ask you a question. Do you believe in the placebo effect?\nAmy: Of course I do. There have been many studies proving its validity.\nSheldon: Great. Now, this may look like a Tic Tac, but it is really a powerful medication specifically designed to cure your illness as well as freshen your breath.\nAmy: Sheldon, this isn\xe2\x80\x99t helping. Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you just let me get some rest.\nSheldon: How can you sleep? I\xe2\x80\x99m not done making you feel better. I still have to put a cold rag on your head, sing to you and apply VapoRub to your chest.\nAmy: You, you want to rub something on my chest?\nSheldon: Yes. All over it.\nAmy: Maybe we should start with that.\nSheldon: Now you\xe2\x80\x99re being a responsible patient. Now, you may notice some tingling.\nAmy: Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m counting on it.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nHoward: Okay, dig in.\nMr. Rostenkowski: Hold up. Bless us, O Lord for these Thy gifts which we are about to receive from Thy bounty through Christ our Lord. Amen.\nHoward: Took the words right out of my mouth.\nBernadette: So, Dad, have you done any fishing lately?\nMr. Rostenkowski: I\xe2\x80\x99m going next weekend.\nHoward: Oh, you like to fish?\nMr. Rostenkowski: Yes.\nHoward: Sure. I can hear it in your voice.\nMrs. Rostenkowski: Oh, if he didn\xe2\x80\x99t like it, he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go.\nHoward: You know, I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t thought of that. (To Bernadette, whispering) Help me.\nBernadette: Hey, Dad, maybe you could take Howard fishing sometime. Give you guys a chance to get to know each other better.\nHoward: No, no. We know each other well enough. He\xe2\x80\x99s been talking my ear off all night.\nBernadette: Howie, I think you\xe2\x80\x99d have fun.\nMr. Rostenkowski: Fine, you can tag along.\nBernadette: Terrific. My two favorite fellas gone fishin\xe2\x80\x99.\nHoward: Well, hang on a second, Bernie. Next weekend, we have that thing.\nBernadette: What thing?\nHoward: You know, the thing.\nBernadette: Oh, that thing. No, I cancelled that thing.\nMr. Rostenkowski: All right, it\xe2\x80\x99s settled. You and I are going fishing.\nHoward: Great. (To Bernadette) Thanks for the help.\nScene: The stairwell.\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99ve never even been fishing. This is gonna be a disaster.\nRaj: If you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to look foolish doing something, you should practice. Do you know how many Beef Wellingtons I made by myself before I invited you guys over? I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you a hint. You can see them here, here and here.\nLeonard: Raj is probably right. You should get someone to give you some pointers.\nHoward: Do either of you guys know how to fish?\nLeonard: No.\nRaj: No. But if you catch anything, I know how to steam it in banana leaves.\nHoward: Come on, we must know somebody who can do manly stuff like this.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nPenny: S\xe2\x80\x99up?\nScene: The apartment.\nPenny: Step one, worms.\nHoward: Ew!\nPenny: Okay, right there, ew is one of the things you\xe2\x80\x99re not gonna want to say in front of your father-in-law. It\xe2\x80\x99s right up there with icky and get it away. Now pick one up.\nHoward: Really?\nPenny: You\xe2\x80\x99re gonna have to do it when you\xe2\x80\x99re fishing.\nHoward: Okay.\nPenny: What are you waiting for?\nHoward: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, for them to die of natural causes.\nPenny: Just pick up a worm and put him on this hook.\nHoward: Fine. There.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m no expert, but I think the hook has to go through the worm.\nHoward: Fine. Sorry, Mr. Worm. Sherm. Sherm the Worm.\nPenny: Hey, don\xe2\x80\x99t name him. Just jab a hook in his face.\nRaj: You got this, buddy.\nLeonard: Yeah, come on, Howard. Hook that worm.\nRaj: You can do it.\nPenny: That\xe2\x80\x99s great. Cheerleading, way to man things up.\nScene: Amy\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nSheldon (reading): And the control group displayed significantly fewer genetic abnormalities. But, because of flaws in the experimental design relating to environment and diet, they lived inconclusively ever after. The end.\nAmy: That was great. Rub my chest again. (Knock at door)\nSheldon: No. I need to get you down for a nap. And for some reason, that VapoRub gets you all fired up. (Opens door)\nBernadette: How\xe2\x80\x99s the poor thing?\nSheldon: Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m hanging in there. Thanks for asking.\nBernadette: Okay, Amy, I brought you some drugs we were working on in the lab. This is proving really good for congestion, but there\xe2\x80\x99s a slight chance it can make your tears burn like acid, so if you take it, happy thoughts.\nSheldon: Uh, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to draw you a soothing bath. Where\xe2\x80\x99s your bath thermometer?\nAmy: I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a bath thermometer.\nSheldon: Fine. Then I\xe2\x80\x99m going to draw you a nerve-wracking bath of indeterminate temperature.\nBernadette: This is a really good expectorant. Although some test subjects reported lactating uncontrollably when they heard music.\nAmy: Okay, okay, here\xe2\x80\x99s the deal. I don\xe2\x80\x99t need your medicine. I\xe2\x80\x99m not sick.\nBernadette: I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand.\nAmy: I got better two days ago. It\xe2\x80\x99s just been so nice having Sheldon take care of me.\nBernadette: So you\xe2\x80\x99ve just been lying to him?\nAmy: See the stuff in my nose? Rubber cement.\nBernadette: I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to be judgy, but this is the kind of thing lunatics do.\nAmy: All right. I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell him.\nSheldon (off): Amy, would you be strong enough to bathe yourself, or do you need my help?\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell him tomorrow. Mama needs a bath.\nScene: The apartment.\nPenny: Now, let\xe2\x80\x99s assume, by some miracle, you actually catch a fish. You\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to know how to gut it. So, what you\xe2\x80\x99re going to do is you\xe2\x80\x99re going to take your knife, slice him right up the belly. (Howard gags) You want me to stop?\nHoward: No, I\xe2\x80\x99m fine. Keep going.\nPenny: All right. Now, you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to cut too deep into its guts, or the blood will just squirt all over your face. (Howard, Leonard and Raj gag) Oh, my God. What is with you guys?\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s not our fault. Our dads never did anything like this with us.\nPenny: What, never?\nLeonard: My dad was an anthropologist. The only father-son time he spent was with a 2,000-year-old skeleton of an Etruscan boy. I hated that kid.\nRaj: Mine just took me to his gynecology office. I got so bored, I\xe2\x80\x99d put vaginal lubricant on the bottom of my shoes and pretend I was ice-skating.\nHoward: Yeah, well, my quality father-son time was spending my adolescence looking out the window waiting for my dad to come back someday.\nRaj: Yeah, okay, Howard wins.\nLeonard: You know, maybe we didn\xe2\x80\x99t have opportunities like this when we were growing up, but right now, there\xe2\x80\x99s a dad that wants to take you on a fishing trip.\nHoward: You\xe2\x80\x99re right. Oh! I should do this.\nPenny: Great. Here you go. What you\xe2\x80\x99re going to do is you\xe2\x80\x99re going to stick your thumb down its throat, grab the guts and pull.\nHoward: Here we go. Oh!\nPenny: Oh, look, it\xe2\x80\x99s a female. You can see all the eggs. (All the guys gag)\nScene: Amy\xe2\x80\x99s apartment. Amy is dancing to \xe2\x80\x9cWalking on Sunshine\xe2\x80\x9d. Hears door and turns off stereo.\nAmy: Oh, Sheldon, am I glad you\xe2\x80\x99re back. Taking a turn for the worst. I think I\xe2\x80\x99m going to need another bath.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m surprised to hear that. See, the other day, I was concerned that you weren\xe2\x80\x99t recovering, so while you were sleeping, I took a cheek swab and had it cultured in the lab.\nAmy: Oh?\nSheldon: I got the results back. Have you developed any of the following symptoms? A growing nose, or perhaps a warm sensation in the trouser region? Also known as full-blown liar, liar, pants on fire.\nAmy: All right, all right. But I really was sick at the beginning. It\xe2\x80\x99s just been so nice having you take care of me.\nSheldon: It hurts that you would lie to me, Amy. I thought our relationship was based on trust and a mutual admiration that skews in my favour.\nAmy: I feel terrible I did this.\nSheldon: It pains me to say it, but I think some form of penalty is in order, so as to discourage this type of behaviour in the future.\nAmy: I suppose that\xe2\x80\x99s fair. What do you suggest?\nSheldon: In a perfect world, I\xe2\x80\x99d lock you in a stockade in the public square. That probably requires a permit.\nAmy: I could not be allowed to go to the opening of the next Star Trek movie.\nSheldon: Oh, that seems overly harsh. I mean, you gave in to a human weakness, you didn\xe2\x80\x99t kill a man. You know, it\xe2\x80\x99s a tad old-school, but my father was not one to spare the rod when my brother would sneak into his truck and drink his driving whiskey.\nAmy: Are you saying you want to spank me?\nSheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to. But it looks like you left me no choice.\nAmy: That\xe2\x80\x99s true. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been a very bad girl.\nScene: Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s parents\xe2\x80\x99 garage.\nHoward: Hi-ho, hi-ho, it\xe2\x80\x99s off to fish we go.\nMr. Rostenkowski: That\xe2\x80\x99s what you\xe2\x80\x99re wearing?\nHoward: No good? The guy at the sporting goods store said these are what fishermen wear.\nMr. Rostenkowski: Maybe in cartoons.\nHoward: Wish I had known that before I posted all those pictures on Facebook.\nMr. Rostenkowski: All right, let\xe2\x80\x99s hit the road. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t mind shooting some ducks in the morning.\nHoward: Wait, now we\xe2\x80\x99re shooting things?\nMr. Rostenkowski: I like using a big shell. You can\xe2\x80\x99t eat them afterwards, but it\xe2\x80\x99s fun watching them blow up.\nHoward: Sir, I\xe2\x80\x99m flattered that you invited me, and I really want you to like me, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think this trip is the way to do it. And I can\xe2\x80\x99t return these things if there\xe2\x80\x99s chunks of duck all over them.\nMr. Rostenkowski: So, why\xe2\x80\x99d you agree to come?\nHoward: \xe2\x80\x98Cause Bernadette made me.\nMr. Rostenkowski: I tried to back out, too. My wife said I had to go.\nHoward: Really? Your wife makes you do stuff? You\xe2\x80\x99re a big, scary cop.\nMr. Rostenkowski: You\xe2\x80\x99re an astronaut, and your wife makes you do things, and she\xe2\x80\x99s only four feet tall.\nHoward: So, what do we do now? They expect us to go away for the weekend.\nMr. Rostenkowski: Ah. There\xe2\x80\x99s an Indian casino near Palm Springs. You know how to shoot craps?\nHoward: No, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not a stranger to dice games. I was the Temple Beth-El Hebrew School Yahtzee champion.\nMr. Rostenkowski: Mazel tov. I\xe2\x80\x99ll teach you how to play.\nHoward: Really? Thank you, sir.\nMr. Rostenkowski: Call me Mike.\nHoward: Okay. Oh, boy, we\xe2\x80\x99re just married to a couple of ballbusters, huh, Mike?\nMr. Rostenkowski: That\xe2\x80\x99s my wife and daughter you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about.\nHoward: Great couple of gals.\nMr. Rostenkowski: I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go that far.\nScene: Amy\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nSheldon: Are you prepared to receive your punishment?\nAmy: One second. I want to put on some music.\nSheldon: Why?\nAmy: I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to disturb the people next door while you discipline me.\nSheldon: Very well, then. Get over my knee. Let\xe2\x80\x99s begin.\nAmy: Oh, my.\nSheldon: Excuse me. You\xe2\x80\x99re not supposed to be enjoying this.\nAmy: Then maybe you should spank me harder.\nSheldon: Maybe I will.\nAmy: Ooh!\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
