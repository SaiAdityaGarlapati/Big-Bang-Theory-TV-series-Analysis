b'Scene: The comic book store.\nHoward: It\xe2\x80\x99s amazing people keep coming to comic book stores instead of just downloading comics digitally.\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s probably for the best. For a lot of these guys, the weekly trip here is the only chance their mom has to go down to the basement and change their sheets.\nHoward: Oh, that reminds me, I get fresh sheets tonight. Yay.\nSheldon: Well? What do you think of New Comic Book Night? Magic, huh?\nAmy: Sheldon, I\xe2\x80\x99m disappointed. As a brilliant man, you\xe2\x80\x99re entitled to a vice. I could understand frequenting an opium den or hunting your fellow man for sport. But this? Lame-o.\nSheldon: Well, A, comic books employ storytelling through sequential art, a medium that dates back 17,000 years to the cave paintings of Lascaux, and B, you play the harp. Like that\xe2\x80\x99s cool.\nStuart: Can I help you find anything?\nAmy: A comic that depicts a woman whose bosom can\xe2\x80\x99t be used as a floatation device.\nStuart: Sorry. Most of the guys who come in here like big boobs. Couple of them have big boobs.\nRaj: Hey, look, the new Warlords of Ka\xe2\x80\x99a expansion pack is out.\nHoward: A new one? Unbelievable. They just keep making up more cheesy monsters, slapping them on cards and selling them at 25 bucks a pop. It\xe2\x80\x99s like a secret tax on guys who can\xe2\x80\x99t get laid.\nRaj: They\xe2\x80\x99re not even trying. Remember the Satanimals pack with the Hellephant? Why, absurd. What was he, a bad elephant who died and went to hell? What could an elephant possibly do that would cause him eternal damnation?\nHoward: Wild West and Witches? What kind of loser cares about a showdown between Billy the Kid and the White Wizard of the North?\nRaj: A total loser. Obviously a guy with a six-shooter beats an old man with a magic wand.\nLeonard: Well, ho-hold on. What if the wizard casts a Helmet of Confusion spell on Billy the Kid\xe2\x80\x99s cowboy hat?\nHoward: What? Please! This is Billy the Kid we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about. I mean, the wizard would get shot between the eyes before he could ever get out the words, what the hell is Billy the Kid doing in the mystic realm of Ka\xe2\x80\x99a?\nStuart: Leonard, what\xe2\x80\x99s the deal with Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s friend Amy? Are they a couple?\nLeonard: Couple of weirdos. Why?\nHoward: You interested in Amy?\nStuart: Well, I mean, she didn\xe2\x80\x99t look through me with soul-sucking, ball-shriveling hatred and contempt. I like that in a woman. Could you run it by Sheldon if I could ask her out?\nLeonard: Sure. I guess.\nRaj: Stuart, settle an argument for us. Who would win, Billy the Kid or the White Wizard?\nStuart: If I tell you that, I\xe2\x80\x99m robbing you of the hours of fun you could have for the magical, rootin\xe2\x80\x99 tootin\xe2\x80\x99 low price of $24.95.\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99ll take one.\nHoward: Mmm, make it two.\nLeonard: I hate all of you and myself. Three.\nStuart: I\xe2\x80\x99ll ring it up. Like shooting nerds in a barrel.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: Hey, can I talk to you about something? It\xe2\x80\x99s a little awkward.\nSheldon: I know what this is about. Given the professional standstill you\xe2\x80\x99re at, you\xe2\x80\x99re wondering if this is the appropriate time to abandon your research and focus on teaching. Yes. And if I may suggest, consider changing disciplines. Yeah, to the humanities, perhaps history. One of the advantages of teaching history is that you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to create things, you know, you just have to remember stuff that happened and then parrot it back. You could have fun with that.\nLeonard: Yeah, that\xe2\x80\x99s not it. Stuart\xe2\x80\x99s kind of interested in Amy.\nSheldon: Oh, of course he is. She\xe2\x80\x99s very interesting. Did you know, when she was 14, she severed the webbing between her own toes?\nLeonard: No. He wanted me to find out if you\xe2\x80\x99d have a problem with him asking her out.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure how to respond, Leonard. I don\xe2\x80\x99t own Amy. Can\xe2\x80\x99t own a person. At least not since? 1863. President Lincoln freed the? Slaves! Come on Leonard, if you\xe2\x80\x99re going to teach history, these are the kind of facts you\xe2\x80\x99ll have to know.\nLeonard: You know what? Never mind. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to tell him it\xe2\x80\x99s okay to ask her out.\nSheldon: The question is moot. There is no way that Stuart, an impoverished peddler of picture books, would be at all appealing to Amy Farrah Fowler, a noted neurobiologist capable of performing surgery on her own feet with nothing but nitrous oxide from cans of whipped cream as anesthesia.\nLeonard: All right, but just for the record, I checked in with you to see how you\xe2\x80\x99d feel about it.\nSheldon: Fine. The record shall so reflect. Now, getting back to the problem at hand, what to do with a washed-up experimental physicist.\nLeonard: I am not washed-up.\nSheldon: Oh, Leonard. Lots of people love you and want to help you, but they can\xe2\x80\x99t until you admit the problem.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nPenny: Well, ladies, we killed the bottle.\nAmy: I had half a glass.\nBernadette: I didn\xe2\x80\x99t have any.\nPenny: Okay, don\xe2\x80\x99t judge me. So, what do you want to do, go to the movies, go dancing, lay down for a little bit?\nAmy: Or we play Travel Twister.\nBernadette: Amy, really? Twister?\nAmy: Excuse me. I\xe2\x80\x99ve passed many an enjoyable evening playing this game. And I\xe2\x80\x99m sure it\xe2\x80\x99s a lot more exciting when you play with other people. What do you say, bestie? We can do shirts and skins. I\xe2\x80\x99m shirts. Called it.\nBernadette: I\xe2\x80\x99m too small for Twister. And roller coasters. And sitting with my feet on the floor. Hope you enjoyed the prenatal cigarettes, Mom.\nPenny: Hey, you know, my mom smoked pot when she was pregnant with me, and I turned out just fine. Hey, look, I have peach schnapps. Thank God.\nAmy (reading a text on her phone): Guys, something happened.\nPenny: What\xe2\x80\x99s wrong?\nAmy: I think a boy likes me.\nBernadette (reading): Hi. It\xe2\x80\x99s Stuart. We met at the comic book store. I was wondering if you\xe2\x80\x99d like to get coffee sometime. It\xe2\x80\x99s okay if you say no. It might be the kick in the pants I need to start taking Zoloft.\nPenny: Amy, little vixen. Just working it under all those layers of wool and polyester.\nBernadette: What are you going to do? Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t he know you have a boyfriend?\nPenny: Oh, she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have a boyfriend, she has a Sheldon. So do you like Stuart?\nAmy: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. He\xe2\x80\x99s nice. He\xe2\x80\x99s funny. He has the sallow, drawn countenance associated with an overactive thyroid gland. That\xe2\x80\x99s kind of hot.\nPenny: Okay, look, sweetie, we all love Sheldon, but you\xe2\x80\x99ve been with him over a year now. If it\xe2\x80\x99s not going anywhere, what does it hurt to look around?\nBernadette: Well, yeah, I guess they\xe2\x80\x99re not engaged like me and Howie.\nPenny: Yeah, for what it\xe2\x80\x99s worth, engaged people can look around, too. Lot of options out there.\nScene: The comic book store.\nSheldon: Where\xe2\x80\x99s Stuart?\nSpeccy Guy Behind Counter (sniggering): Out.\nSheldon: Who are you?\nSpeccy Guy: I\xe2\x80\x99m Dale. He left me in charge.\nLeonard: Really?\nDale: Yeah. I don\xe2\x80\x99t get it, either.\nLeonard: I want to return this Wild West and Witches Ka\xe2\x80\x99a expansion pack.\nDale: Sorry. I don\xe2\x80\x99t do returns. They\xe2\x80\x99re hard.\nLeonard: Sure, sure. Uh, when will Stuart be back?\nDale: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. He went out for coffee. With a girl.\nSheldon: Oh, I guess I was wrong.\nLeonard: You okay?\nSheldon: Am I okay? Leonard, I\xe2\x80\x99m on a lifelong trajectory that includes a Nobel Prize and cities named after me, all four wisdom teeth fit comfortably in my mouth without need of extraction, and my bowel movements run like a German train schedule. Am I okay?\nDale: I\xe2\x80\x99m okay, too!\nScene: The apartment. They are playing Warlords of Ka\xe2\x80\x99a.\nRaj: Wild Bill Witchcock.\nLeonard: A tribe of Abra-Comanches.\nSheldon: Flaming Spittoon. And for the record, I\xe2\x80\x99m very disappointed in you cowpokes. We\xe2\x80\x99re playing our inaugural round of Wild West and Witches, and I\xe2\x80\x99m the only one who bothered to dress for the occasion. (Spits into a spittoon) Patooie.\nHoward: We\xe2\x80\x99re not wearing cowboy hats, Sheldon. It looks ridiculous.\nSheldon: And I suppose my boots and spurs are ridiculous, too?\nLeonard: Yeah.\nHoward: Very.\nRaj: Incredibly so.\nSheldon: Did it look ridiculous when we got the Satanimals pack and I dressed up as a Beelzebobcat?\nLeonard: Yeah.\nHoward: Very.\nRaj: Incredibly so.\nSheldon: All right, fine. Let\xe2\x80\x99s just play.\nLeonard: We should go easy on him. Amy\xe2\x80\x99s out with Stuart tonight.\nHoward: Wait a minute. Are you telling me that Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s patented blend of condescension and no sex isn\xe2\x80\x99t enough to hold on to a woman?\nSheldon: Cluck, cluck, cluck. What are we, ladies at a quilting bee? Or are we men playing a fantasy card game set in a magical frontier town?\nHoward: Sorry. Creepy Tepee.\nRaj: Annie Ogly.\nLeonard: Hocus Pocus Pocahontas.\nSheldon: And may I point out it is the three of you who are obsessed with Stuart and Amy, not me. I think you need to ask yourselves who\xe2\x80\x99s really being ridiculous here. (Walks away with spurs jangling)\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s you.\nHoward: You are.\nRaj: Totally you.\nScene: The cafeteria.\nRaj: Hey, guys, check it out. The deluxe limited edition Wild West and Witches expansion pack in the signed and numbered collector\xe2\x80\x99s tin.\nLeonard: Oh come on, no! We just bought the regular pack.\nHoward: Ooh, a sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s badge.\nRaj: Yeah, it\xe2\x80\x99s also a wand.\nLeonard: With a hologram? Nice. Hey, do you see this?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m in the matrix, Leonard, I see everything.\nLeonard: You\xe2\x80\x99ve got to be kidding me. You friended Stuart on Facebook?\nHoward: I thought you didn\xe2\x80\x99t like Facebook anymore.\nSheldon: Don\xe2\x80\x99t be silly. I\xe2\x80\x99m a fan of anything that tries to replace actual human contact.\nRaj: Please. You\xe2\x80\x99re looking at Facebook to find out how their date went.\nSheldon: Really? You think I care if a man, what, shared a pumpkin latte with a dynamite lady?\nRaj: You\xe2\x80\x99re so full of it.\nSheldon: You are free to believe whatever you like. And unfriend Rajesh Koothrappali.\nRaj: You unfriended me? Seriously?\nHoward: Oh, yeah. Now he\xe2\x80\x99s gonna miss all those great updates like, I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe I waited this long to make my own potpourri.\nLeonard: Sheldon, why don\xe2\x80\x99t you just acknowledge that you have feelings for Amy and you don\xe2\x80\x99t want her going out with other men?\nSheldon: And unfriend Leonard Hofstadter.\nHoward: Here\xe2\x80\x99s a radical thought. Go old-school, challenge Stuart to a fight. I mean, nothing makes the ladies hotter than two skinny white guys swatting at each other with their eyes closed.\nSheldon: And unfriend Howard Wolowitz.\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99s all of us. Can I use the laptop?\nSheldon: Why?\nLeonard: I have to buy that stupid collector\xe2\x80\x99s tin.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment door. Sheldon knocks three times.\nPenny (off): Who do we love?\nSheldon: Penny. (Knock, knock, knock)\nPenny (off): Who do we love?\nSheldon: Penny. (Knock, knock, knock)\nPenny (off): Who do we love?\nSheldon: Penny.\nPenny: Hello, Sheldon. Come on in.\nSheldon: Thank you.\nPenny: What\xe2\x80\x99s up?\nSheldon: I came to ask if you would like to go on a date with me.\nPenny: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, what?\nSheldon: A date. You and me. Dining, dancing, perhaps you\xe2\x80\x99d like to take in a prizefight.\nPenny: God, are you trying to make Amy jealous?\nSheldon: No. Why is everyone so obsessed with Amy and Stuart? And whether or not they may be having more pumpkin lattes or intercourse tonight.\nPenny: Okay, listen to me. Playing games is not gonna help get Amy back.\nSheldon: I am not trying to get her back. But, out of curiosity, what is a way?\nPenny: All right, honey, let me tell you a story. There was a guy I liked, and I never told him how I felt. Eventually, he started going out with someone else, and I always regretted it. Do you see where I\xe2\x80\x99m going with this?\nSheldon: I believe I do.\nPenny: Mm.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m the guy.\nPenny: You\xe2\x80\x99re not the guy.\nSheldon: Are you sure? That would explain so much. Your constant presence in my apartment, that baffling dalliance with Leonard just to be near me, the way you call me sweetie all the time.\nPenny: I call everyone sweetie.\nSheldon: You tramp.\nPenny: Look, Sheldon, all I\xe2\x80\x99m saying is strap on a pair and go talk to Amy.\nSheldon: Strap on a pair? Of what, skates?\nPenny: Oh, sweetie, you are so not the guy.\nScene: A cinema.\nStuart: If you\xe2\x80\x99re bored, you can go. I understand.\nAmy: No, I\xe2\x80\x99m having a nice time.\nStuart: Don\xe2\x80\x99t patronize me.\nSheldon: Excuse me. Excuse me. Pardon me. Pardon me. Excuse me. Hi, Stuart.\nStuart: Hi, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Pardon me. Excuse me.\nAmy: Sheldon, what are you doing here?\nSheldon: The thought of you sitting in a darkened theatre with a character like Stuart is repellent. No offence, Stuart.\nStuart: None taken. Although repellent is kind of a, kind of a strong word.\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry this causes you discomfort, but based on the currently established parameters of our relationship, I can put myself in any repellent situation I want.\nStuart: Um, again\xe2\x80\xa6\nSheldon: Stuart, please. You\xe2\x80\x99re being rude.\nAmy: Anything else?\nSheldon: I believe I would like to alter the paradigm of our relationship.\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99m listening.\nSheldon: With the understanding that nothing changes whatsoever, physical or otherwise, I would not object to us no longer characterizing you as not my girlfriend.\nAmy: Interesting. Now try it without the quadruple negative.\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re being impossible.\nAmy: Hi, Stuart.\nSheldon: Fine. Amy, will you be my girlfriend?\nAmy: Yes.\nSheldon: Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s enough of that. Sorry to interrupt. You two enjoy your date. Here\xe2\x80\x99s a dollar for your troubles. Get yourself some Sour Patch Kids.\nScene: Outside Amy\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nStuart: So, other than you taking your relationship to the next level with another guy, this was nice.\nAmy: Yes, well, thanks for seeing me to my door.\nStuart: Oh, you\xe2\x80\x99re welcome.\nSheldon (inside): (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. Let\xe2\x80\x99s wrap things up out there.\nAmy: Um, good night, Stuart.\nStuart: Good night.\nSheldon (inside): Take the hint, Stuart. The lady said good night.\nAmy: How did you get into my apartment?\nSheldon: Wow. Is that the kind of nagging I can expect now that you\xe2\x80\x99re my girlfriend? Good thing I drew this up.\nAmy: What\xe2\x80\x99s that?\nSheldon: I present to you the relationship agreement. A binding covenant that, in its 31 pages, enumerates, iterates and codifies the rights and responsibilities of Sheldon Lee Cooper, here and after known as the boyfriend, and Amy Farrah Fowler, here and after known as the girlfriend.\nAmy: It\xe2\x80\x99s so romantic.\nSheldon: Mutual indemnification always is. Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you start perusing while I set up my notary stamp.\nAmy: Section 5: Hand-holding. Hand-holding is only allowed under the following circumstances. A: Either party is in danger of falling off a cliff, precipice or ledge. B: Either party is deserving of a hearty handshake after winning a Nobel Prize. C: Moral support during flu shots. Seems a bit restrictive.\nSheldon: Feel free to retain a lawyer.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment. The girls are playing twister.\nAmy: Penny, I said right hand red.\nPenny (picking up wine): Yeah, I heard you. I got red.\nAmy: Bernadette, left foot yellow.\nBernadette: We should play limbo next. No one beats me at limbo.\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Bernadette.\nAmy: That\xe2\x80\x99s my boyfriend. It\xe2\x80\x99s open!\nSheldon: I got a splinter.\nAmy: What do you want me to do about it?\nSheldon: Relationship agreement Section 4, Boo-boos and Ouchies. You have to take care of it.\nAmy: I should\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten a lawyer.\nBernadette: Looks like it\xe2\x80\x99s just us playing. (Penny snores) Penny? (Penny snores louder) Penny, we\xe2\x80\x99re out of wine!\nPenny (waking, bleary): You should probably drive.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
