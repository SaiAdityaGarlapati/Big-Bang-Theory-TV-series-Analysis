b'Scene: Sheldon and Amy\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nSheldon: Hello, I\xe2\x80\x99m Dr. Sheldon Cooper.\nAmy: And I\xe2\x80\x99m Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler.\nSheldon: And welcome to the first on location episode of Dr. Sheldon Cooper and Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler present\xe2\x80\xa6\nBoth: Dr. Sheldon Cooper\xe2\x80\x99s Fun with Flags.\nSheldon: Hit it.\nHoward (singing): For joy and fun there\xe2\x80\x99s no better manner than to fly a pennant flag or banner.\nRaj (singing): What fills my heart and makes my eyes moist? Sending a flag up a pole on a hoist.\nTogether: Fun with flags, fun with flags.\nHoward: Oh say can you see, it\xe2\x80\x99s fun with flags.\nTogether: Fun with flags.\nAmy: As you may notice, just one of the changes around here is our new house band.\nSheldon: Who haven\xe2\x80\x99t learned their place yet.\nAmy: We\xe2\x80\x99re also coming to you live from a different apartment.\nSheldon: Dr. Fowler and I began an experiment in living together after her apartment became water damaged. This is our friend Penny\xe2\x80\x99s place. You may remember her from our episode, Flags and the People Who Don\xe2\x80\x99t Understand Them.\nAmy: So, in the spirit of cohabitation, the theme of today\xe2\x80\x99s episode is flags of two regions coming together as one. Such as the flag of St. Kitts and Nevis.\nSheldon: So, let\xe2\x80\x99s roll up our sleevis and get to know Nevis. (Drumroll) Well, I, I like that, but next time check with me.\n(Cut to Penny, Leonard and Bernadette watching in the apartment opposite)\nAmy: Did you know that the flag was designed by a student named Edrice Lewis\xe2\x80\xa6\nPenny: I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe I\xe2\x80\x99m saying this, but can we watch the news or something?\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s cute, they\xe2\x80\x99re having fun living together.\nPenny: Yeah, I wonder what they\xe2\x80\x99re gonna do when her apartment\xe2\x80\x99s ready.\nBernadette: Actually, it\xe2\x80\x99s been ready for weeks.\nLeonard: What do you mean?\nBernadette: Well, they finished the work early, but she\xe2\x80\x99s been telling Sheldon they\xe2\x80\x99re behind schedule.\nLeonard: So, she\xe2\x80\x99s just been lying to him?\nPenny: Well, you\xe2\x80\x99ve lied to Sheldon.\nLeonard: Yeah, but to make him leave, not to make him stay.\nSheldon: Buda and Pest united to form Budapest. And that\xe2\x80\x99s why Budapest is the Budabest. Now.\nHoward: Oh, right. (Drumroll)\nCredits sequence.\nScene: Sheldon and Amy\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nSheldon: Thank you for your services, gentlemen. Now, I\xe2\x80\x99m hoping to broaden our audience with your youthful rock and roll music.\nHoward: Aw, you think you have an audience, that\xe2\x80\x99s funny.\nRaj: We don\xe2\x80\x99t get paid? Nothing? Not even a sandwich?\nAmy: It\xe2\x80\x99s almost dinner time. You in the mood for anything?\nSheldon: Yeah, we could get Thai food near your apartment and then drop in and check on the progress.\nAmy: Oh, you don\xe2\x80\x99t want do that, it\xe2\x80\x99s a construction zone.\nSheldon: So?\nAmy: Well, what about your fear of stray nails and butt cracks?\nSheldon: I am terrified of stepping on a nail and falling into a butt crack.\nAmy: Anyway, how about dinner?\nSheldon: You know, if you\xe2\x80\x99d like, I could call your landlord and complain.\nAmy: Thanks, but you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to.\nSheldon: Oh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind, I\xe2\x80\x99m very good at complaining. If it were an Olympic sport, I\xe2\x80\x99d complain about what a stupid sport it is and then I\xe2\x80\x99d take home the gold.\nAmy: Good stuff. So, uh, what about dinner?\nSheldon: Is it me, or are you purposely changing the subject?\nAmy: No. And on the subject of subjects, is your use of the word subject the same or different as when we speak about the subject of a king?\nSheldon: I have a feeling you\xe2\x80\x99re still doing it. But I find that topic irresistible, so, now, in ancient Mesopotamia, the king referred to the people as his property.\nScene: The cafeteria.\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m serious, JPL\xe2\x80\x99s actually developing a robot arm that could grab an asteroid before it hits us.\nLeonard: So their plan for saving the Earth from Armageddon is hoping a bunch of scientists can catch a ball?\nRaj: If we\xe2\x80\x99re all gonna die, why am I eating so much kale?\nLeonard: You\xe2\x80\x99re awful quiet, everything okay?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m concerned about Amy. She\xe2\x80\x99s acting a bit odd lately.\nHoward: Oh. Well, just out of curiosity, what registers as odd to you?\nSheldon: Her behaviour. No, I have the feeling that she\xe2\x80\x99s hiding something.\nLeonard: I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t worry about it. She\xe2\x80\x99s probably just distracted by work.\nSheldon: Well, whatever it is, it\xe2\x80\x99s troubling me. And I can\xe2\x80\x99t eat, I can\xe2\x80\x99t sleep. And don\xe2\x80\x99t even ask about the consistency of my bowel movements.\nHoward: You heard him, guys, don\xe2\x80\x99t ask.\nSheldon: Why would she keep something from me, you know? I shared my body with that woman. And my Netflix password. They recommended Stella Got Her Groove Back because of her.\nLeonard: Buddy, buddy, listen, nothing bad is going on, she just, she just didn\xe2\x80\x99t want you to know that the work on her apartment was finished a couple weeks ago.\nSheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand.\nLeonard: She\xe2\x80\x99s enjoying living with you and she didn\xe2\x80\x99t want it to end early.\nSheldon: So, she\xe2\x80\x99s deceiving me in order to spend more time with me?\nLeonard: Yes.\nSheldon: Oh. Well, I feel both flattered and hurt. Like when people say I look like that skeleton from Nightmare Before Christmas.\nRaj: Oh my God, that\xe2\x80\x99s who you look like.\nLeonard: Sheldon, this is not a big deal. It\xe2\x80\x99s a little white lie, everyone does it.\nRaj: Not me, I\xe2\x80\x99m a hundred percent honest in all of my relationships.\nHoward: And how single are you right now?\nRaj: Eating cake on the toilet single.\nSheldon: Well, I won\xe2\x80\x99t tolerate deception in my relationship. I have no choice but to confront her.\nHoward: Don\xe2\x80\x99t do that, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got gold here. Hang onto it until you\xe2\x80\x99re in trouble and then throw it in her face.\nLeonard: Why would you tell him that? That\xe2\x80\x99s terrible advice.\nHoward: So you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to have anything on Penny?\nLeonard: Well, of course not.\nHoward: So, if I actually know something right now, and I do, you don\xe2\x80\x99t want me to tell you?\nLeonard: Uh, no.\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99ll take that as a yes. She\xe2\x80\x99s secretly been moving your collectibles into storage a little at a time and you haven\xe2\x80\x99t noticed.\nLeonard: Are you kidding me?\nHoward: See, I\xe2\x80\x99ve known that for weeks, but, you know, I waited till the moment when it would cause him the most pain.\nScene: Leonard and Penny\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom.\nLeonard: Superman\xe2\x80\x99s gone, my stormtrooper\xe2\x80\x99s gone.\nSheldon: Your Klingon word-of-the-day calendar\xe2\x80\x99s gone.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99d say damn it in Klingon, but that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t until next month.\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s khoo-vakh.\nLeonard: Khoo-vakh! She took my Where\xe2\x80\x99s Waldo.\nSheldon: No, no, he\xe2\x80\x99s over there.\nLeonard: Oh, yeah, there he is.\nScene: The stairwell.\nPenny: So, what\xe2\x80\x99s the deal with your apartment? Why\xe2\x80\x99s it taking so long?\nAmy: Um, it was a drywall problem.\nPenny: Oh, no, what happened?\nAmy: Well, the drywall got wet, and you do not want wet drywall because when drywall gets wet, it\xe2\x80\x99s really more\xe2\x80\xa6\nPenny: Wet wall?\nAmy: Or damp wall, just as bad.\nPenny: Mm. So why don\xe2\x80\x99t they just get more drywall?\nAmy: Well, they went to get some, but the woman at the wall store said it was going on sale and they should wait because the savings\xe2\x80\xa6\nPenny: Okay, are you done? Bernadette told me your apartment\xe2\x80\x99s ready.\nAmy: I was done at wet wall, but you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t let it go.\nPenny: But is Sheldon really believing all this crap?\nAmy: Well, he started to question it, but then I fake sneezed on him and he ran to take a shower. Please don\xe2\x80\x99t say anything, I feel terrible about this.\nPenny: Oh, don\xe2\x80\x99t worry, I won\xe2\x80\x99t.\nAmy: Thanks.\nPenny: The woman at the wall store?\nAmy: Let it go.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Are you going to confront Penny?\nLeonard: Eventually, I guess. Although, I am kind of curious how long she thinks she can keep hiding my stuff without me knowing.\nSheldon: Hmm. You know, perhaps instead of confronting them, we should see how far they\xe2\x80\x99re willing to spin their tangled webs. Like that Spider-Man action figure that used to be on your desk.\nLeonard: Oh, my God, I\xe2\x80\x99m going blind.\nPenny: Hi.\nAmy: Food\xe2\x80\x99s here.\nSheldon: Excellent. I\xe2\x80\x99m very hungry. Speaking of which, what\xe2\x80\x99s going on with your apartment?\nAmy: Oh, uh, they\xe2\x80\x99re still working on it.\nSheldon: Interesting. Very interesting.\nPenny: Yeah, we swung by her apartment on the way to the restaurant, and they\xe2\x80\x99re gonna be fixing it for a while.\nSheldon: Wait, uh, you saw her apartment?\nPenny: I did, still a mess.\nSheldon: Leonard?\ns\nLeonard: Yeah?\nSheldon: jlyajbe\xe2\x80\x99. DaH nep\xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 Penny? (I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand, is Penny lying?)\nLeonard: jISovbe\xe2\x80\x99 (I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.)\nAmy: Why are you speaking Klingon?\nSheldon: Why are you speaking English?\nAmy: This is ridiculous. Penny, do you remember when I taught you Ubbi Dubbi?\nPenny: Ubabsubolubutubly ubi duboo.\nAmy: Ubexcubellent. Duboes Shubeldubon knubow ubi\xe2\x80\x99m lubyubing?\nPenny: Ubif Lubenubard tubold hubim, ubit\xe2\x80\x99s pubossubibuble.\nSheldon: Oh, wait, stop that.\nAmy: You stop that.\nSheldon: Dayaj\xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 (Do you understand them?)\nLeonard: ghobe\xe2\x80\x99 (No.)\nSheldon: Qu\xe2\x80\x99vatlh (Damn it.)\nPenny: Okay. That\xe2\x80\x99s enough. You know what? What is going on?\nLeonard: Fine, I told Sheldon that her apartment\xe2\x80\x99s been finished, but then you just said it\xe2\x80\x99s not, so now I\xe2\x80\x99m all confused.\nAmy: Penny was just covering for me. My place has been ready for two weeks.\nSheldon: How could you lie to me?\nPenny: Uh, she\xe2\x80\x99s enjoyed living with you. It\xe2\x80\x99s called being in love.\nLeonard: Mm-hmm, and what\xe2\x80\x99s it called when you secretly get rid of all your husband\xe2\x80\x99s stuff?\nPenny: What? Tha\xe2\x80\xa6 That is not true.\nLeonard: Bernadette told Howard, Howard told me, plus, I can see all my stuff is gone.\nPenny: Oh, so, you believe your friend, and your friend\xe2\x80\x99s wife and your own eyes over me? Wow.\nLeonard: You really didn\xe2\x80\x99t think I\xe2\x80\x99d notice my stuff was missing?\nPenny: Uh, did you notice your key chain?\nLeonard: Where\xe2\x80\x99s Batman?\nBernadette: Hey.\nPenny: Why did you tell Howard I was hiding Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s things?\nBernadette: One sec. Why did you tell Leonard I told you Penny was hiding his things?\nHoward: It just came up because we, we were talking about secrets and\xe2\x80\xa6 wait, juH qachHom Dotlh Sov \xe2\x80\x98Iv (Who knows the status of Amy\xe2\x80\x99s apartment?)\nAmy: Everybody stop it with that.\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99m not really a part of this, so I\xe2\x80\x99m just gonna dig in.\nAmy: And I\xe2\x80\x99d like to know why you blabbed about my apartment.\nHoward: You\xe2\x80\x99re up, blabby.\nBernadette: Amy, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have said anything.\nAmy: I guess it\xe2\x80\x99s okay. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry that I lied about my apartment.\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s all right.\nLeonard: And?\nPenny: And what? Your wizard robes are next to go.\nRaj: Now that everything\xe2\x80\x99s out on the table, you, you think you two will keep living together?\nSheldon: Despite recent events, I do consider our experiment in cohabitation to have been positive.\nAmy: Are you saying you\xe2\x80\x99d like to live with me?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m open to the possibility.\nPenny: Ubamy bube cubool.\nAmy: Whatever.\nHoward: You know, if he moves across the hall for good, Leonard could keep the stuff you don\xe2\x80\x99t like in Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s old room. Solves everything.\nPenny: That\xe2\x80\x99s a great idea.\nLeonard: Ooh, maybe I could turn it into a gaming den.\nRaj: That would be amazing.\nSheldon: Wuh wuh hold on, excuse me, that\xe2\x80\x99s my room.\nLeonard: But you won\xe2\x80\x99t be living here.\nSheldon: But that\xe2\x80\x99s my room.\nLeonard: But you won\xe2\x80\x99t be living here.\nSheldon: But that\xe2\x80\x99s my room.\nLeonard: You guys might want to start eating. But you won\xe2\x80\x99t be living here.\nPenny: Sweetie, once you stop paying rent, none of this is really yours.\nSheldon: But that\xe2\x80\x99s my room.\nEveryone: But you won\xe2\x80\x99t be living here.\nScene: Sheldon and Amy\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom.\nAmy: Thank you for understanding.\nSheldon: Hey, I get it. Everybody wants to spend more time with me. I\xe2\x80\x99m like a man made of sugar in a world of ants.\nAmy: Good night.\nSheldon: Night. If we did continue living together, would it be here?\nAmy: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. It, it could be.\nSheldon: Of course there\xe2\x80\x99s, there\xe2\x80\x99s always your apartment.\nAmy: Sure, sure, we, we could live in my apartment.\nSheldon: I hate your apartment.\nAmy: Sorry, you brought it up?\nSheldon: Well, I suppose we could find a whole new place. You know, and, technically, we don\xe2\x80\x99t even have to stay in Pasadena. We could, we could move to Altadena or a place that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t even end in dena.\nAmy: It\xe2\x80\x99s kind of exciting. I mean we could do whatever we want.\nSheldon: But what if we move and we don\xe2\x80\x99t like it? What if there\xe2\x80\x99s a smoker in the building? Or pets? Or there could be mould? There could be traffic noise. I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna have to learn a whole new bus route. Are you trying to soothe me by singing the Star Trek theme as a lullaby?\nAmy: Yes.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m not a child, don\xe2\x80\x99t do that.\nAmy: Sorry.\nSheldon: Do you know 2001: A Space Odyssey? All right, now that\xe2\x80\x99s soothing.\nScene: Leonard and Penny\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom\nLeonard: Look, I get it, this is still my room, we haven\xe2\x80\x99t really made it yours.\nPenny: Thank you.\nLeonard: Which is why I got you this Pink Power Ranger. Put it anywhere you like.\nPenny: Okay, but you may feel some discomfort.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m kidding, I want you to feel at home here. Decorate it any way that makes you happy.\nPenny: Do you really mean that?\nLeonard: I really do.\nPenny: Great, and just so you know, I\xe2\x80\x99m not getting rid of all your stuff.\nLeonard: Yeah? What are you keeping?\nPenny: That candle and you.\nLeonard: What about my robot poster?\nPenny: Uhbubububuh, I can make do with just the candle.\nScene: Sheldon and Amy\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom.\nAmy: What\xe2\x80\x99s going on?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m struggling with the thought of leaving my old bedroom.\nAmy: Can it be more of an internal struggle?\nSheldon: I need to see it. While I\xe2\x80\x99m gone, don\xe2\x80\x99t breathe on my pillow.\nAmy: How about if I just don\xe2\x80\x99t breathe at all?\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s my girl. What on earth? What is going on?\nLeonard: Oh, hey, Sheldon.\nPenny: We turned your room into a sex dungeon.\nSheldon (waking up in bed): No.\nAmy: What is happening?\nScene: The comic book store.\nHoward: Okay, last question. The chaps he was wearing, assless?\nSheldon: Can we just focus on the decision I\xe2\x80\x99m facing?\nRaj: We can, but for the record, all chaps are assless.\nSheldon: Gentlemen, please, this is a significant decision. Now, do Amy and I continue living together? Or do I move back in with Leonard?\nLeonard: Over my assless chaps you will.\nHoward: This isn\xe2\x80\x99t complicated. Do you love Amy?\nSheldon: Yes.\nRaj: Do you like living with her?\nSheldon: Yes.\nLeonard: Do you know what you need to do now?\nSheldon: Apparently, figure this out on my own \xe2\x80\x99cause you guys are no help at all.\nScene: The stairwell.\nAmy: Hi.\nSheldon: Hello.\nAmy: What are you doing?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m just contemplating Buridan\xe2\x80\x99s donkey.\nAmy: I understand. I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave you be.\nSheldon: What, you\xe2\x80\x99re familiar with the reference?\nAmy: Of course. Jean Buridan proposed a philosophical thesis stating that a hungry donkey placed between two equidistant bales of hay would be paralysed by indecision and would starve to death.\nSheldon: Exactly.\nAmy: Well, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want you to starve to death, so here\xe2\x80\x99s an eggplant.\nSheldon: Thank you.\nAmy: You know, some people believe that Buridan was plagiarizing Aristotle.\nSheldon: Really?\nAmy: Although, in Aristotle\xe2\x80\x99s example, he proposed an equally hungry and thirsty man caught between food and drink.\nSheldon: Huh. Yeah, I wonder if that\xe2\x80\x99s related to the 12th century Persian philosopher, Al-Ghazali and his story of a man caught between two dates.\nAmy: Are you suggesting Al-Ghazali was Aristotelian? \xe2\x80\x98Cause if anything, he was anti-Aristotelian.\nSheldon: Al-Ghazali was anti-Aristotelian? Boy, you think you know a guy.\nScene: Leonard and Penny\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom.\nPenny: Okay. Open your eyes and see your new room.\nLeonard: Wow.\nPenny: I know I went a little overboard. We can always dial it back.\nLeonard: No, no, no, no, no, it\xe2\x80\x99s, it\xe2\x80\x99s important to me that you have the bedroom you want.\nPenny: Oh, that means so much. I love you.\nLeonard: I love you, too.\nScene: Sheldon and Amy\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nLeonard: Just hiding some stuff in your closet, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell Penny.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
