b'Scene: The Cheesecake Factory\nPenny: Hey. So you guys ready to order?\nSheldon: Since we come in every Tuesday night at six o\xe2\x80\x99clock and order the same exact thing, and it\xe2\x80\x99s now six oh eight, I believe your question not only answers itself but also stands alongside such other nonsensical queries as who let the dogs out? and, uh, How are they hanging?\nPenny: Okay. So, the usual, with extra spit on Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s hamburger.\nAmy: Penny, a moment? Do you have plans this weekend?\nPenny: Oh, gee, Amy, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, I\xe2\x80\x99m actually pretty busy this weekend.\nSheldon: Probably serving food that was ordered today.\nAmy: That\xe2\x80\x99s too bad. I was hoping you could be my plus-one at the Institute of Interdisciplinary Studies\xe2\x80\x99 symposium on the impact of current scientific research on societal interactions.\nPenny: The what?\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s an annual science conference. We\xe2\x80\x99ve all been invited to speak.\nPenny: Oh. Oh, okay, well, you know, like I said, I have plans, so.\nAmy: Shame. Since you\xe2\x80\x99re my best friend, I thought it would be a good bonding opportunity.\nPenny: I\xe2\x80\x99m your best friend?\nAmy: Don\xe2\x80\x99t you read my blog?\nPenny: Oh, don\xe2\x80\x99t feel bad. I never read Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s, and I used to sleep with him.\nAmy: Do you know anybody else who would appreciate an all-expense-paid spa weekend at a four-star resort in Big Sur?\nPenny: No, I really, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, free what? Sorry, what, what?\nLeonard: I think her weekend just opened up.\nPenny: Wait, wait, just to be clear, when you guys say spa, does that mean the same thing as when regular people say it?\nLeonard: Pretty much. Except we keep our shirts on in the sauna.\nPenny: You know, it is going to be difficult, but I\xe2\x80\x99m going to cancel my plans so I can do this for my bestie.\nAmy: Please don\xe2\x80\x99t touch my breasts.\nPenny: I, I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to.\nAmy: All right. I just want to establish boundaries.\nPenny: Boy, this is great. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t had a vacation in ages.\nSheldon: In order to take a vacation, one first has to work.\nPenny: You know, for a smart guy, you really seem to have a hard time grasping the concept, don\xe2\x80\x99t piss off the people who handle the things you eat.\nAmy: That does seem to be a valid principle.\nSheldon: I trust Penny will adhere to the Official California Restaurant Workers\xe2\x80\x99 Solemn Oath of Ethics and Cleanliness.\xe2\x80\x9d\nAmy: I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe there\xe2\x80\x99s any such thing.\nSheldon: You lied to me?\nCredits sequence.\n  Scene: The apartment.\n  Sheldon: Good morning. If I could have everyone\xe2\x80\x99s attention, please? I know we\xe2\x80\x99re all eager to get on the road to Big Sur, so if we focus, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure we can get through this orientation in under a half an hour. Then it\xe2\x80\x99s just Q&A, quiz, safety drills, pose for commemorative group photo and we\xe2\x80\x99re off.\nLeonard: Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry. Just sit next to me during the quiz, and you can copy my answers.\nSheldon: Raj? What are you doing? I don\xe2\x80\x99t think so. You\xe2\x80\x99ve had your allotted six ounces. The first bathroom break isn\xe2\x80\x99t until the Denny\xe2\x80\x99s located near Bakersfield, which is approximately two and half hours away. Remember, people, we\xe2\x80\x99re only as strong as our weakest bladder.\nHoward (after Raj whispers to him): Nobody cares about your Kegel exercises.\nSheldon: All right. We have seven people, and two cars. In the lead car, driven by Leonard, will be myself, Amy Farrah Fowler and Penny.\nAmy: Yes! He had you in the other car, but I got you upgraded.\nPenny: Yay!\nSheldon: She made the case that if we break down in the middle of nowhere, your Nebraska backwoods skills and brawny hands will give us the best chance to survive in the wild.\nPenny: Brawny?\nLeonard: They\xe2\x80\x99re bigger than mine.\nScene: Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s car.\nSheldon: Red Leader to Red Five, come in. Red Leader to Red Five, come in. Howard, you promised.\nHoward (voice): Fine.  Red Five to Red Leader. What do you want now?\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s eleven fifteen. I\xe2\x80\x99m requesting your quarter-hourly location update.\nHoward: Still right behind you.\nSheldon: Copy that, Red Five. Radio contact is sufficient. No need to extend your middle finger.\nPenny: So, Amy, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been wondering, are you and Sheldon going to be sharing a room?\nAmy: No, we discussed it. We decided we didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to jeopardize our relationship by getting to know each other too well.\nSheldon: Indeed. Nothing sours a friendship more than over-familiarity with someone\xe2\x80\x99s toilet routine.\nLeonard: I can vouch for that.\nPenny: Hey.\nLeonard: Not you, him.\nPenny: Oh. Thanks.\nLeonard: Although yours was an eye-opener.\nAmy: Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry, Penny. You\xe2\x80\x99re my plus-one. You\xe2\x80\x99ll bunk with me. And FYI, travel makes me constipated, so I\xe2\x80\x99m the ideal hotel roommate.\nPenny: Terrific. Are we there yet?\nScene: Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s car.\nBernadette: I hope we get there in time to see the keynote address.\nHoward: Really? You want to see the keynote?\nBernadette: Yeah, it sounds fun. Super bacteria: global apocalypse or exciting research opportunity?\nHoward: Actually, I was thinking we could go straight to the room and take a nap.\nBernadette: Really? And miss the keynote?\nHoward: We can watch it later on C-SPAN. Besides, I was really looking forward to you and me napping together in the hotel.\nBernadette: Well honey, if you\xe2\x80\x99re that tired, why don\xe2\x80\x99t you just take a nap here in the car?\nHoward: No, see, it\xe2\x80\x99s not\xe2\x80\xa6\nBernadette: Hang on. It\xe2\x80\x99s Leonard. Hi, Leonard.\nLeonard (voice): Yeah, hi. Listen, I just got a text from Raj. He wanted me to tell you that when Howard says nap, he means sex.\nBernadette: Oh. Thank you, Raj.\nScene: Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s car.\nLeonard: Are you an element in the actinoid series?\nSheldon: No. Amy?\nAmy: Are you usually radioactive when found in nature?\nSheldon: No.\nAmy: Are you in the lanthanoid series?\nSheldon: Amy, it\xe2\x80\x99s Penny\xe2\x80\x99s turn. Penny?\nPenny: Uh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Are you food?\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s not apropos. We\xe2\x80\x99ve already established I\xe2\x80\x99m found in the periodic table.\nPenny: Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s a table, right? I mean, why can\xe2\x80\x99t there be food on it?\nSheldon: I knew she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t lead car material.\nPenny: Who elected you Road Trip God?\nSheldon: Leonard.\nLeonard: It was a late-night vote. We were all exhausted, and he was threatening to filibuster. It\xe2\x80\x99s not technically Road Trip God, it\xe2\x80\x99s Travel Supervisor.\nSheldon: Although Road Trip God does have a certain ring to it.\nPenny: I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand why you people just let him bully you like this. Someone should stand up to him. What\xe2\x80\x99s he going to do?\nScene: Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s car.\nPenny: I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe you let him kick me out of the car.\nHoward: What could we do? He\xe2\x80\x99s the Travel Supervisor.\nBernadette: Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry, Penny. This is a better car anyway.\nHoward: Yeah. It\xe2\x80\x99s the Love Car.\nPenny: Should I ask?\nBernadette (singing): They say we\xe2\x80\x99re young and we don\xe2\x80\x99t know, we won\xe2\x80\x99t find out until we grow.\nHoward (singing): Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if all that\xe2\x80\x99s true, \xe2\x80\x99cause you got me, and, baby, I got you.\nTogether (singing): Babe, mm da-da, da-da, da-da, I got you, babe, da-da, da-da, da-da, I got you, babe\xe2\x80\xa6\nPenny: Red Leader, I\xe2\x80\x99m really sorry.\nScene: The hotel.\nHoward and Bernadette (singing): I got you, babe.\nAmy: I missed you.\nPenny: You know what? I missed you, too.\nVery tall and powerfully built man: Bernadette?\nBernadette: Oh, my God, Glenn!\nGlenn: Great to see you!\nBernadette: Are you here for the conference?\nGlenn: Yeah, I\xe2\x80\x99m doing a global warming panel.\nBernadette: Oh, good for you. Uh, Glenn, this is my boyfriend Howard.\nGlenn: Oh. Nice to meet you.\nHoward: Hi. Ow. Hi.\nGlenn: You\xe2\x80\x99re a lucky man. Bernie\xe2\x80\x99s a great gal.\nHoward: Yes. Bernie sure is.\nGlenn: Well, I got to run. The panel\xe2\x80\x99s tomorrow morning. It\xe2\x80\x99s called, Remembering Snow: A Look Back.\nBernadette: I\xe2\x80\x99ll try to catch it.\nGlenn: Oh, great. Bye.\nBernadette: Bye.\nHoward: Hey, Bernie?\nBernadette: Yeah?\nHoward: Please tell me he\xe2\x80\x99s your gay cousin.\nBernadette: No. He was one of my professors in college.\nHoward: Oh! That\xe2\x80\x99s a relief.\nBernadette: Then we went out for a year. Come on, let\xe2\x80\x99s check in, so we can take that nap.\nHoward (after Raj whispers to him): No, it\xe2\x80\x99s not necessarily proportional. Shut up!\nScene: Howard\xe2\x80\x99s hotel room.\nHoward: That green bag is Dr. Cooper\xe2\x80\x99s. Here\xe2\x80\x99s an extra five. Make him wait. Oh. Right to the nap, huh? Okay? Uh, so, this Glenn guy. You say you went out with him for, like, a year.\nBernadette: Do we really need to talk about my old boyfriend now?\nHoward: No. I guess not. What is he, like, six-four, six-five?\nBernadette: Six-seven.\nHoward: Probably has a hard time finding a suit that fits.\nBernadette: Is something bothering you?\nHoward: No. It\xe2\x80\x99s just\xe2\x80\xa6\nBernadette: What?\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m just thinking. If you had sex with that guy, I mean, there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing I can do here that will make any kind of impact.\nBernadette: Howard, it\xe2\x80\x99s not a contest. I love you. I want to be with you.\nHoward: Yeah, great, love you, too, but, if it were a contest, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have a chance, right?\nBernadette: You can\xe2\x80\x99t think that way.\nHoward: Yep. Loser.\nBernadette: Howard, stop it.\nHoward: Sorry. I just never figured that a guy like me going out with a girl like you would ever have to compete with a guy like that.\nBernadette: Wait a minute, a girl like me? What\xe2\x80\x99s that mean?\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\xa6 I\xe2\x80\xa6\nBernadette: Are you saying you don\xe2\x80\x99t think I\xe2\x80\x99m hot enough to go out with a guy like Glenn?\nHoward: No! No, I\xe2\x80\x99m saying exactly the opposite.\nBernadette: I\xe2\x80\x99m too hot to go out with a guy like Glenn?\nHoward: Yeah, let\xe2\x80\x99s go with that.\nScene: Amy\xe2\x80\x99s hotel room.\nAmy (exiting bathroom): Still nothing. Remind me to try again in an hour.\nPenny: Will do.\nAmy: So, girl talk?\nPenny: Um, sure. What do you, what do you got in mind?\nAmy: Do you subscribe to the Freudian theory of penis envy?\nPenny: Um, I never really thought about it. Why?\nAmy: Sometimes I think it might be nice to have one.\nPenny: Really?\nAmy: Not for sex, for convenience. You can\xe2\x80\x99t deny that, by comparison, our internal plumbing is extremely high maintenance.\nPenny: Again, I\xe2\x80\x99ve never given it much thought.\nAmy: We have time now. Think about it.\nPenny (knock on door): Oh, good. Hey.\nBernadette: Can I stay here tonight?\nPenny: Yeah. Why, what happened?\nBernadette: Howard\xe2\x80\x99s a complete and total ass.\nPenny: Oh, yeah, that. Come on in.\nBernadette: Thanks. I\xe2\x80\x99ll sleep on the floor.\nAmy: Not necessary. Penny and I are perfectly comfortable sharing a bed.\nPenny: We are?\nAmy: Of course, we\xe2\x80\x99re best friends.\nPenny: Oh, right, right, the blog.\nAmy: Word of warning, though. I\xe2\x80\x99m prone to night terrors, so if I wake up kicking and screaming, don\xe2\x80\x99t panic. Just pin me down and stroke my hair, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll be fine.\nScene: Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s room.\nPenny: Hey, can I stay here tonight?\nLeonard: Shh-shh-shh-shh. Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s asleep. What\xe2\x80\x99s going on?\nPenny: Well, Howard\xe2\x80\x99s a complete and total ass, Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s in my bed, and no matter how much you stroke Amy\xe2\x80\x99s hair, she bites.\nLeonard: What?\nPenny: Never mind. Can I stay here or not?\nLeonard: Uh, sure.\nPenny: All right.\nLeonard: So, how do you wanna do this?\nPenny: Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not getting in bed with him.\nLeonard: Yeah, it is a little like getting into Dracula\xe2\x80\x99s coffin.\nPenny: We\xe2\x80\x99re just gonna have to make the best of this.\nLeonard: Okay, when you say make the best of it.\nPenny: Sleep.\nLeonard: Right. So we\xe2\x80\x99ll just call the middle here the Neutral Zone.\nPenny: The what?\nLeonard: Star Trek. You know, the Neutral Zone between the Federation and the Romulan Empire.\nPenny: Oh, okay. Just like old times.\nLeonard: Of course, sometimes the Federation and the Romulans would enter the Neutral Zone to negotiate a temporary truce.\nPenny: Sweetie, let me put this in a way you\xe2\x80\x99ll understand. From the waist down, my shields are up.\nLeonard: Got it, got it. We can do all kinds of stuff from the waist up, you know?\nPenny: Go to sleep.\nLeonard: Good night.\nSheldon: Please tell me you\xe2\x80\x99re not having coitus.\nPenny: We are not having coitus.\nSheldon: Can you guarantee that it won\xe2\x80\x99t happen at any time during the night?\nPenny: Yes.\nLeonard: No.\nScene: Raj\xe2\x80\x99s room.\nTV Announcer: Next on Turner Classic Movies, Bridget Jones\xe2\x80\x99s Diary.\nRaj: Oh, my God, I\xe2\x80\x99m crying already.\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Raj? (Knock, knock, knock) Raj? (Knock, knock, knock) Raj? I need to sleep here tonight.\nRaj: Why?\nSheldon: Howard is a complete and total ass, Bernadette is in Penny\xe2\x80\x99s bed, Amy bites, and Penny may or may not have coitus with Leonard.\nRaj: Okay. Come on in.\nScene: Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s room.\nPenny: Leonard, are you asleep?\nLeonard: No.\nPenny: I really appreciate you letting me stay here tonight.\nLeonard: Sure, no problem.\nPenny: I know it\xe2\x80\x99s kinda weird.\nLeonard: True dat.\nPenny: True dat?\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten a lot more street since we broke up.\nPenny: Right. Still mad at me about that?\nLeonard: No. No, I understand. I got too intense, you had to back off.\nPenny: Thank you.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten a lot better at that, you know. I\xe2\x80\x99ve dated four different women since we broke up and I didn\xe2\x80\x99t tell any of them that I loved them and wanted to have their babies.\nPenny: Good for you.\nLeonard: Okay, good night.\nPenny: Good night. You know, maybe it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be the worst idea in the world to violate the Neutral Zone for just one night. Oh!\nRaj: Hey, Leonard, Sheldon kicked me out of the room, gave me your key.\nLeonard: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s here. (Raj whispers to him) No, we don\xe2\x80\x99t want to watch Bridget Jones\xe2\x80\x99s Diary!\nScene: A conference room.\nSheldon: Good morning and welcome to Science and Society. I\xe2\x80\x99m Dr. Sheldon Cooper, BS, MS, MA, PhD, and ScD. OMG, right? Perhaps that joke was a little too hippie-dippy for this crowd. All right then, we\xe2\x80\x99ll begin with opening remarks. Miss Rostenkowski, would you like to start us off by discussing your assessment of science\xe2\x80\x99s responsibility to society?\nBernadette: Sure. I think all branches of science have to move cautiously these days. It\xe2\x80\x99s not just giant nuclear weapons that can destroy the world. As a microbiologist, I can tell you even the tiniest organisms can still tear you a new one.\nHoward: Interesting. I think what you might need to know about my colleague is that though she claims her field of interest  is tiny organisms, she certainly has spent her fair share of time around what we can assume was pretty massive weaponry.\nBernadette: I think Mr. Wolowitz needs to keep in mind that the past is the past. But he should know that I am the kind of girl who could get all the giant missiles she wants.\nAmy: Are we talking about women wanting penises? Because I\xe2\x80\x99d like to weigh in.\nSheldon: Dr. Koothrappali, would you care to join the conversation?\nRaj: Certainly. I\xe2\x80\x99d like to raise two points. Number one, I think they are talking about penises. And number two, these mimosas are kicking my little brown ass.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99d like to kick your little brown ass.\nRaj: What did I do?\nLeonard: Oh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Maybe when you walk into a hotel room and you see a guy getting back together with his girlfriend, you should consider doing something other than crawling into the adjoining bed.\nRaj: I did. You said no Bridget Jones.\nPenny (voice): We weren\xe2\x80\x99t getting back together! It was a one-time thing!\nSheldon: Excuse me. We\xe2\x80\x99re not taking comments or questions from the audience just yet.\nPenny(voice): Oh, shut up, Sheldon!\nAmy: Hi, bestie.\nPenny(voice): Yeah, hi.\nSheldon: All right, why don\xe2\x80\x99t we see if we can bring this back to topic.\nHoward: Let me ask you something, Bernie.\nSheldon: I guess not.\nHoward: How would you feel if you met my ex-girlfriend and she was like Angelina Jolie?\nBernadette: Oh, come on, Howard, be realistic.\nHoward: What, I\xe2\x80\x99m not hot enough for Angelina Jolie?\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99d like to weigh in here. No.\nSheldon: All right, why don\xe2\x80\x99t we open it up to Q&A from the audience?\nPenny (voice): Yeah, I have a question. Is there anybody who can get me the hell out of here and back to Los Angeles tonight?\nGlenn (voice): I\xe2\x80\x99m driving back to L.A. tonight.\nBernadette: Um, Penny, that\xe2\x80\x99s Glenn. Glenn, that\xe2\x80\x99s Penny.\nLeonard: No!\nScene: Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s car.\nSheldon (voice): Red Leader to Red Five. Red Leader to Red Five. Anybody up for a little game? I spy with my little eye, a nonferrous metal. (Howard throws walkie-talkie out of window)\nScene: Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s car.\nSheldon: Must be out of range.\nAmy: Leonard, can I ask you a question?\nLeonard: Sure.\nAmy: Are you bothered by the fact that your former girlfriend left the symposium with what is probably the most beautiful man I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever seen in my life?\nLeonard: No. Why do you ask?\nAmy: Because we\xe2\x80\x99re going 120 miles per hour.\nSheldon: All right, if no one\xe2\x80\x99s going to guess, I was spying the aluminium rims on the police car we passed a few miles back.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
