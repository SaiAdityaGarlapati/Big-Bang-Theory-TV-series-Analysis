b'Scene: Howard\xe2\x80\x99s laboratory. The phone rings. Howard puts it on speaker.\nHoward: Howard Wolowitz.\nVoice: Hey, Howard. Dave Roeger here at NASA. We need to talk about your upcoming mission.\nHoward: Yes, yes, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been doing my push-ups. I\xe2\x80\x99m still stuck at nine, but that\xe2\x80\x99s going all the way down with no one holding me.\nRoeger: That\xe2\x80\x99s great, uh, but that\xe2\x80\x99s not why I called. We\xe2\x80\x99ve run into a bit of a snafu. Your Soyuz capsule failed the pressurization test, so bottom line, mission\xe2\x80\x99s been scrubbed.\nHoward (Picks up receiver): You\xe2\x80\x99re kidding. So what does that mean? Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Boy, I got to tell you, I\xe2\x80\x99m really disappointed. This was my dream ever since I was a little kid. Okay, well, uh, thanks for the call. Yep, you, too. (Puts down phone.) Yes! Thank you! Oh! Oh! I\xe2\x80\x99m not gonna die in space! I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna die the way God intended, in my late 50s, with a heart full of pastrami.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: A suit shop.\nSheldon (off): I\xe2\x80\x99m going to need a larger shirt. This one\xe2\x80\x99s a little tight under the arms.\nAssistant: Okay.\nLeonard: Do you think maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s tight because you\xe2\x80\x99re wearing long underwear?\nSheldon: Yes, of course that\xe2\x80\x99s why it\xe2\x80\x99s tight.\nLeonard: All right, let me rephrase the question. Why are you wearing long underwear?\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re kidding. Shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t the question be why aren\xe2\x80\x99t you?\nLeonard: No, it should be: why are you?\nSheldon: Leonard, these rental tuxedos have been worn by hundreds of sweaty strangers. I don\xe2\x80\x99t like my own sweat touching my skin, how do you think I feel about theirs?\nAssistant: Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you slip this on?\nSheldon: Said the hangman offering a noose.\nRaj: Well, that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t as entertaining as when he rents bowling shoes, but it was right up there.\nHoward: Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s it. My orders have been rescinded. I am officially no go to space.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, Howard, but I got to tell you, I\xe2\x80\x99m a little relieved you\xe2\x80\x99re not going.\nHoward: Why?\nLeonard: Come on, you were gonna go up in a rocket designed in the 1960s by the Russians.\nHoward: Yeah, so?\nLeonard: When was the last time you were at Best Buy and you heard someone say, ooh, check out this Blu-ray player, it must be good, it was built in Russia\xe2\x80\x9d?\nHoward: Well, their technology isn\xe2\x80\x99t that bad.\nRaj: When you come back to Earth in a Soyuz capsule, you free-fall from space at 500 miles per hour, and the only thing that slows you down is a little parachute that pops out right before you crash into the ground. And the whole thing was designed by the same brilliant minds who were unable to capture Rocky and Bullwinkle.\nHoward: All right, well, whatever. I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t worried.\nRaj: You weren\xe2\x80\x99t?\nHoward: Let me explain the difference between you and me. You watch Star Trek. I live it.\nRaj: Oh, please. I don\xe2\x80\x99t remember the episode of Star Trek where the guy never goes to space and brags about it in a tuxedo store.\nHoward: Make all the jokes you want, but there\xe2\x80\x99s only one of us here brave enough to almost do what I almost did.\nSheldon: Ah, much better.\nLeonard: You must be burning up.\nSheldon: A little. But not more than your urethras will be after whatever\xe2\x80\x99s in those pants swims up them. Well, I cut quite the dashing, yet hygienic figure, don\xe2\x80\x99t I? I look like the Flash about to get married. Oh! A tissue! A tissue! Oh, good Lord!\nAssistant: Uh, where\xe2\x80\x99s he going?\nLeonard: He keeps emergency Purell in the car.\nSheldon: Keys! Keys! Keys!\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s door.\nPenny: Hey, you.\nLeonard: Before I come in, you should know, I have gas. (Holds up gas canister)\nPenny: For the record, not your worst opening line.\nLeonard: Check it out. It\xe2\x80\x99s the gas I use in my free-electron laser to support high voltages. But it also has an interesting secondary use. Here. Breathe this in.\nPenny: B-Before I do it, if you\xe2\x80\x99re a cop you have tell me, right?\nLeonard: Just try it.\nPenny: Okay. (In weirdly low voice) What\xe2\x80\x99s it supposed to\xe2\x80\xa6 Oh, my God, this is so freaky!\nLeonard (in low voice): You\xe2\x80\x99re a mean one Mr. Grinch.\nPenny: Okay. Me, me, me. Ready? (Low voice) Leonard, I am your father.\nLeonard: I have never been more attracted to a woman who sounds like a man in my life.\nPenny: Oh, Mm. Hey, you know how we\xe2\x80\x99ve been taking things slow?\nLeonard: Mm-hmm.\nPenny: Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been thinking, and maybe I\xe2\x80\x99m ready to take things a little faster.\nLeonard: Oh, great.\nPenny: Mm-hmm.\nLeonard: And I promise, after waiting four months, fast is what you\xe2\x80\x99re gonna get.\nPenny: You know, just-just one thing. Look, we\xe2\x80\x99re in a really great place right now, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to do anything that will make stuff all weird again.\nLeonard: So we won\xe2\x80\x99t let it get weird.\nPenny: Okay. Oh, and just a heads-up, mm, since the last time you saw me naked, I got a Cookie Monster tattoo. The acceptable responses when you see it are awesome or nothing.\nLeonard: What about (inhales gas, in low voice) Cookies!\nScene: Amy\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Amy? (Knock, knock, knock) Amy? (Knock, knock, knock) Amy?\nAmy: Seven o\xe2\x80\x99clock, right on time.\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s not an accident. I waited outside your door for twenty minutes.\nAmy: Well, dinner\xe2\x80\x99s almost ready.\nSheldon: I must say, I was surprised you chose to spend our date night in your apartment. As I mentioned, the Pasadena City Council is debating longer crosswalk times, and later, the LEGO store is having a midnight madness sale. You ask anyone, that\xe2\x80\x99s a hot date.\nAmy: Tempting choices, but I have something special planned for tonight.\nSheldon: What can be more special than having an adequate amount of time to cross the street on your way to buy a tiny LEGO Indiana Jones?\nAmy: With our friends moving forward in their relationships, I\xe2\x80\x99ve decided that we should make progress in ours as well.\nSheldon: Oh, dear Lord. Two years ago, we didn\xe2\x80\x99t even know each other, and now I\xe2\x80\x99m in your apartment after dark. How much faster can this thing go?\nAmy: I had a feeling you\xe2\x80\x99d be reluctant, which is why I\xe2\x80\x99m going to dip into my neurobiological bag of tricks.\nSheldon: Oh, you brain monkeys kill me. Dip away.\nAmy: I have devised an experiment that I believe will increase your feelings for me in an accelerated time frame.\nSheldon: And how do you propose to do that? Uh, hope you\xe2\x80\x99re not thinking about some sort of LSD thought control. Because there\xe2\x80\x99s only one mind-expanding drug that this man enjoys, and that\xe2\x80\x99s called school.\nAmy: Human beings form emotional attachments as they grow up. In your case, to your mother, superheroes, et cetera. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to attempt an experiment that will get you to transfer those feelings to me.\nSheldon: Well, seems what\xe2\x80\x99s on the menu tonight is malarkey with a big side of poppycock.\nAmy: We\xe2\x80\x99ll see. Let\xe2\x80\x99s start with a little romantic dinner music, shall we?\nSheldon: Super Mario Bros. theme?\nAmy: Yes.\nSheldon: I see what you\xe2\x80\x99re doing. You\xe2\x80\x99re attempting to build on the work of Ebbinghaus by triggering an involuntary memory of me playing that game, admittedly the happiest 600 hours of my childhood, but it won\xe2\x80\x99t work.\nAmy: Fine. There\xe2\x80\x99s no reason we still can\xe2\x80\x99t have a lovely dinner. Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you have a seat.\nSheldon: Da-da-da da-da dum, boink, boink.\nAmy: May I offer you something to drink?\nSheldon: You know I don\xe2\x80\x99t drink.\nAmy: Not even strawberry Quik?\nSheldon: I love strawberry Quik. It\xe2\x80\x99s my favourite pink fluid, narrowly beating out Pepto-Bismol.\nAmy: Oh, I know. I think it will go nicely with what I have prepared for dinner.\nSheldon: Spaghetti with little pieces of hot dog cut up in it!\nAmy: Just like your mommy used to make.\nSheldon: Oh yummy, yummy! We should do this more often. Uh-oh.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. I did, I crossed a line. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to!\nPenny: Who says something like that right in the middle of sex?\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, it just came out. People say weird things during sex all the time.\nPenny: Okay, well, they sure as hell don\xe2\x80\x99t say that.\nLeonard: It was the heat of the moment.\nPenny: No, the heat of the moment is, ooh, yeah, just like that, not will you marry me?\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. Just, just give me another chance.\nPenny: Why, so you can crawl under the covers and go, hey, baby, want to go look for houses in neighbourhoods with good schools?\nLeonard: Again, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. You know, with Howard and Bernadette getting married, I got caught up in a little wedding fever. I take it back.\nPenny: You can\xe2\x80\x99t take something like that back. I mean, what are we even supposed to do now?\nLeonard: Okay, at some point, we\xe2\x80\x99ll look back and this is going to be a funny story. Why don\xe2\x80\x99t we just start doing that now?\nPenny: You\xe2\x80\x99re kidding.\nLeonard: No. Hey, do you remember that time when I proposed to you in bed? And you were all, like, what are you doing? That was so funny. So funny.\nPenny: It\xe2\x80\x99s not funny.\nLeonard: Give it a minute. Is that a little smile I see there? I should go.\nScene: Howard\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom.\nHoward: Hey, I was thinking. For our first dance at the wedding, what if we learn the final number from Dirty Dancing?\nBernadette: You\xe2\x80\x99re kidding.\nHoward: No, come on. How cool would that be? Me running into your arms, you lifting me up into the air.\nBernadette: Oh, you\xe2\x80\x99re in a good mood.\nHoward: Yeah, well, why wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t I be? You know, I\xe2\x80\x99m marrying the girl of my dreams, and I finally got my mother to agree not to come on our honeymoon. (Phone rings) Oh, hang on. Oh, it\xe2\x80\x99s NASA. Wolowitz. Oh! Hi, Dave. What\xe2\x80\x99s up? No kidding. Really? Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s great news. Great, great news. All right, I\xe2\x80\x99ll watch my e-mail for the details. Okay, talk soon.\nBernadette: What\xe2\x80\x99s so great?\nHoward: It looks like I\xe2\x80\x99m going into space after all.\nBernadette: Oh, Howie, that\xe2\x80\x99s wonderful!\nHoward: Uh-huh, wonderful. Yay.\nBernadette: What happened? I thought they cancelled your mission.\nHoward: Th-They did. But NASA really wants my telescope up on the space station, so they\xe2\x80\x99re putting me on an earlier launch.\nBernadette: When?\nHoward: A week from Friday.\nBernadette: What? We\xe2\x80\x99re getting married that Sunday.\nHoward: You\xe2\x80\x99re right. I, I can\xe2\x80\x99t go to space. I have to get married, and no one can say that\xe2\x80\x99s not a good reason. I\xe2\x80\x99ll call him back.\nBernadette: Wait. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be the one who stands in your way.\nHoward: Well, too bad, you already did. It\xe2\x80\x99s a done deal. Oh, well. But I forgive you.\nBernadette: No. That\xe2\x80\x99s not how I want to start our marriage, killing your dream. We\xe2\x80\x99ll have the wedding when you get back.\nHoward: But what about all the plans and the guests?\nBernadette: We\xe2\x80\x99ll call them. Although my dad\xe2\x80\x99s gonna go a little nutso over losing his deposits.\nHoward: You\xe2\x80\x99re right, he is! Your dad\xe2\x80\x99s gonna be furious. There\xe2\x80\x99s no way he\xe2\x80\x99s gonna let us postpone this wedding. Well, we tried.\nBernadette: I\xe2\x80\x99ll talk to him. He won\xe2\x80\x99t say no to his little girl.\nHoward: No. I, uh, I should talk to him, man to man.\nBernadette: But, Howie, my dad can be a bully. He\xe2\x80\x99s gonna make you cancel your space flight.\nHoward: We can only hope\xe2\x80\xa6 that he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t.\nScene: The apartment. Sheldon and Leonard are playing three dimensional chess.\nSheldon: Bishop to queen four, level two. Check.\nLeonard: Sheldon, knight takes bishop. You all right?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m fine.\nLeonard: Are you? You left your queen exposed from above, you trapped your knight in the corner, and you keep sighing and saying, why me?\nSheldon: Very well. Can I ask you a question about women?\nLeonard: We got you that book last year. Wasn\xe2\x80\x99t everything in there?\nSheldon: No, I\xe2\x80\x99m having a relationship problem with Amy. And by the way, that book gave me nightmares.\nLeonard: Well, if it makes you feel any better, I screwed things up pretty good with Penny.\nSheldon: Look at us, Leonard, engaging in the social convention of men bellyaching about their ol\xe2\x80\x99 ladies.\nLeonard: I guess we are. So, what\xe2\x80\x99s going on?\nSheldon: Believe it or not, Amy has embarked on a campaign to increase my feelings for her by making me happy.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, that must be very difficult for you.\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s awful. This morning, she arranged for me to be an Amtrak junior conductor for the day. It, it\xe2\x80\x99s usually only open to children. She got them to make an exception.\nLeonard: Shame on her.\nSheldon: They let me blow the whistle, Leonard.\nLeonard: She\xe2\x80\x99s good.\nSheldon: I know. And it gets worse. Her efforts are causing me to have affectionate feelings for her at inappropriate times.\nLeonard: You mean, like in bed or in the shower?\nSheldon: No! Would you please stop referencing that infernal book? For example, this morning, I was calculating the random motion of virtual particles in a vacuum, when suddenly the particles morphed into an image of Amy\xe2\x80\x99s dandruff gently cascading down onto her pale, slightly hunched shoulders. Oh, what has that vixen done to me, Leonard? And how do I make it stop?\nLeonard: Well, if you had a physical relationship, I\xe2\x80\x99d say propose during sex. Turns out that\xe2\x80\x99s a real mood killer.\nSheldon: I assume we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about you now?\nLeonard: Yeah.\nSheldon: So, that\xe2\x80\x99s how this works? I complain, and then you complain, and no one offers any solutions?\nLeonard: Pretty much.\nSheldon: Well, no wonder the women are winning.\nScene: Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s father\xe2\x80\x99s house.\nHoward: Mr. Rostenkowski, are you busy?\nMr. Rostenkowski: I\xe2\x80\x99m just looking at some old pictures. Come on in.\nHoward: Family pictures, or\xe2\x80\xa6 holy crap, that\xe2\x80\x99s a dead person.\nMr. Rostenkowski: Last murder case before I retired. How many bodies do you see there? Careful, it\xe2\x80\x99s a trick question.\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure.\nMr. Rostenkowski: Nah, you\xe2\x80\x99ll never get it. It\xe2\x80\x99s a fraction.\nHoward: How about that. Anyway, sir, I need to talk to you about something.\nMr. Rostenkowski: Walnut?\nHoward: No, thank you. I\xe2\x80\x99m allergic.\nMr. Rostenkowski: Oh, sure. My partner used to have that. He\xe2\x80\x99s dead now.\nHoward: From nuts?\nMr. Rostenkowski: Nah, his wife shot him. But she was nuts, so in a way.\nHoward: Nice story. Anyway, the reason I wanted to talk to you is NASA has moved up my launch to the International Space Station.\nMr. Rostenkowski: Yeah, so?\nHoward: So, the date is going to conflict with me marrying your daughter. Now, I know what you\xe2\x80\x99re going to say, I made a commitment to Bernadette and to your family and I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a hell of a lot of nerve coming in here and demanding that we postpone this thing. Well, message heard and understood. Mission cancelled. Thank you.\nMr. Rostenkowski: Where are you going?\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. May I be excused?\nMr. Rostenkowski: No, you may not. Let me tell you something. When I first met you\xe2\x80\xa6 You just gonna stand there?\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know, is this going to\xe2\x80\xa6 Well, I should sit\xe2\x80\xa6 May I be seat\xe2\x80\xa6 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll just sit.\nMr. Rostenkowski: When I first met you, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t like you.\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of that, sir.\nMr. Rostenkowski: But then you and I had some time together.\nHoward: Uh-huh.\nMr. Rostenkowski: It did not get better.\nHoward: Right, right.\nMr. Rostenkowski: That silly Beatle haircut and you riding around on a red Vespa, and you still living at home with your mother. To be honest, I thought Bernadette chose you to punish me. But then I heard about your astronaut thing, and I realized I judged you too fast. Maybe you are the right guy for my little girl.\nHoward: Oh, I am. And just so you know, I\xe2\x80\x99d still be an astronaut, even if I didn\xe2\x80\x99t go to space. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got an I.D. Card and a NASA golf shirt.\nMr. Rostenkowski: No, no, you got to go. You can\xe2\x80\x99t turn down an opportunity like this.\nHoward: But what about the wedding and all the money you put down for the reception?\nMr. Rostenkowski: You let me worry about that. You go up to that space station, and you make me proud.\nHoward: Um, okay.\nMr. Rostenkowski: You got a problem with that?\nHoward: All right, look, I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna level with you. I\xe2\x80\x99m terrified about going into space. What if I don\xe2\x80\x99t make it back?\nMr. Rostenkowski: It\xe2\x80\x99s gonna be okay, son.\nHoward: You really think so?\nMr. Rostenkowski: Of course. A pretty girl like Bernadette, she\xe2\x80\x99ll find a new guy.\nScene: The stairwell.\nPenny: Hey.\nLeonard: Hey. Off to work?\nPenny: Yeah.\nLeonard: Have a nice night.\nPenny: Okay, you, too.\nLeonard: Penny, just, wait. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been thinking about what I said when we were in bed the other night.\nPenny: Yeah, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been thinking about it, too.\nLeonard: I noticed you never answered me.\nPenny: You\xe2\x80\x99re right. (Kisses him) No.\nLeonard: Uh, follow-up. Are we still dating?\nPenny: Yep.\nLeonard: Is it still weird \xe2\x80\x99cause I proposed?\nPenny: Yep.\nLeonard: I have a couple more quick questions. Do you want to call me from the car?\nPenny: No!\nLeonard: I played that pretty well. (Enters apartment. Amy, dressed as a Vulcan starfleet officer, is examining Sheldon.)\nAmy: Hello, Leonard.\nLeonard: What are you doing?\nAmy: We\xe2\x80\x99re playing doctor. Star Trek style.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m in hell, Leonard. Don\xe2\x80\x99t stop.\nTeleplay: Bill Prady, Steve Holland & Maria Ferrari\nStory: Chuck Lorre, Steven Molaro & Jim Reynolds\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
