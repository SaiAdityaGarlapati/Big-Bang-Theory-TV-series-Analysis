b'Scene: The Apartment.\nSheldon: Damn you, walletnook.com.\nLeonard: Problem?\nSheldon: The online description was completely misleading, they said eight slots plus removable ID, to any rational person that would mean room for nine cards, but they don\xe2\x80\x99t tell you the removable ID takes up one slot, it\xe2\x80\x99s a nightmare.\nLeonard: Okay, now, do you really need the honorary Justice League of America membership card?\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s been in every wallet I\xe2\x80\x99ve owned since I was five.\nLeonard: Why?\nSheldon: It says keep this on your person at all times. (Knock on door) It\xe2\x80\x99s right here under Batman\xe2\x80\x99s signature.\nLeonard opens door. Raj and Howard are outside. Raj is holding a laptop which is open. His parents are on the screen.\nRaj: And this is Leonard and Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nHoward: Guess whose parents just got broadband.\nRaj: May I present, live from New Delhi, Dr and Mrs V. M. Koothrappali.\nLeonard: Hi.\nDr Koothrappali: Lift up the camera. I\xe2\x80\x99m looking at his crotch.\nRaj: Sorry papa.\nDr Koothrappali: Oh, there\xe2\x80\x99s much better. Hi.\nLeonard: Hi!\nRaj: And over here is Sheldon.\nSheldon: Hi.\nRaj: He lives with Leonard.\nMrs Koothrappali: Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s nice. Like Haroun and Tanweer.\nRaj: No, no, not like Haroun and Tanweer.\nMrs Koothrappali: Such sweet young men, they just adopted the cutest little Punjabi baby.\nLeonard: Yeah, we\xe2\x80\x99re not like Haroun and Tanweer!\nDr Koothrappali: So are you boys academics like our son?\nTogether: Yes.\nDr Koothrappali: And your parents are comfortable with your limited earning potential?\nTogether: Not at all.\nRaj: Papa, please don\xe2\x80\x99t start.\nDr Koothrappali: God, it\xe2\x80\x99s just a question, he\xe2\x80\x99s so sensitive.\nRaj: Okay, that\xe2\x80\x99s my life, that\xe2\x80\x99s my friends, good to see you, say goodbye.\nTogether: Bye!\nDr Koothrappali: Wait, wait. Before you go we have good news. Put the computer down and gather your friends.\nRaj: What is it papa.\nDr Koothrappali: Friends.\nHoward (as they gather): Is it just me, or does webchatting with your clothes on seem a little pointless.\nMrs Koothrappali: Rajesh, do you remember Lalita Gupta?\nRaj: The little fat girl that used to kick me in the samosas and call me untouchable.\nMrs Koothrappali: Yes. Well, now she\xe2\x80\x99s a dental student at USC, so we gave her your contact information.\nRaj: Why did you do that?\nDr Koothrappali: You\xe2\x80\x99re 26 years old Rajesh. We want grandchildren.\nRaj: But Papa, I\xe2\x80\x99m not supposed\xe2\x80\xa6\nMrs Koothrappali: Lalita\xe2\x80\x99s parents approve the match.\nDr Koothrappali: If you decide on a spring wedding, we can avoid monsoon season.\nRaj: Spring wedding?\nMrs Koothrappali: It\xe2\x80\x99s up to you dear, we don\xe2\x80\x99t want to meddle.\nRaj: If you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to meddle, then why are you meddling.\nSheldon: If I may, your parents probably don\xe2\x80\x99t consider this meddling, while arranged marriages are no longer the norm, Indian parents continue to have a greater than average involvement in their children\xe2\x80\x99s lives.\nRaj: Why are you telling me about my own culture?\nSheldon: You seemed confused.\nRaj: Sorry, Mommy, Papa, but with all due respect I really can\xe2\x80\x99t go through\xe2\x80\xa6\nMrs Koothrappali: Sorry darling, we have to go. Doogie Howser is on. Grandma, it\xe2\x80\x99s Doogie time! Bye bye.\nDr Koothrappali: Bye bye.\nRaj: I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe it.\nHoward: Neither do I. Doogie Howser\xe2\x80\x99s been off the air for like, twenty years.\nLeonard: Actually, I read somewhere that it\xe2\x80\x99s one of the most popular programmes in India.\nSheldon: It might speak to a cultural aspiration to have one\xe2\x80\x99s children enter the medical profession.\nLeonard: I bet you\xe2\x80\x99re right.\nHoward: I bet they love Scrubs.\nSheldon: What\xe2\x80\x99s not to love?\nRaj: Excuse me, hello? My parents are trying to marry me off to a total stranger, what am I going to do?\nSheldon: I suggest you go through with it.\nRaj: What?\nSheldon: Romantic love as the basis for marriage has only existed since the nineteenth century. Up until then, arranged marriages were the norm, and it served society quite well.\nHoward: It\xe2\x80\x99s the entire premise of Fiddler on the Roof.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m not a big fan of musicals, but I love that show.\nHoward: Me too. Of course, it speaks to me culturally.\nSheldon: Understandable, but there\xe2\x80\x99s a universality to that story which transcends ethnicity.\nHoward: Let\xe2\x80\x99s not forget it\xe2\x80\x99s got some really catchy tunes.\nAll: (various noises of agreement)\nRaj: Okay, I know what I\xe2\x80\x99m going to do.\nLeonard: What?\nRaj: Find new friends.\nHoward: So who wants to rent Fiddler?\nSheldon: No need, we have the special edition.\nLeonard: Well, maybe we are like Haroun and Tanweer.\nCredits sequence\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon (on phone): This is Dr Sheldon Cooper. Yeah, I need to cancel my membership to the Planetarium. Yeah, well I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry too, but there\xe2\x80\x99s just no room for you in my wallet. Yeah, I understand, but it was between you and the Museum of Natural History and, frankly, you don\xe2\x80\x99t have dinosaurs. Well I\xe2\x80\x99ll miss you too, bye bye. Okay, I know you\xe2\x80\x99re texting about me, and I\xe2\x80\x99d really like you to stop.\nRaj (entering): Oh dear, I am rightly and truly screwed.\nLeonard: Hey, I thought you were finding new friends.\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99ve got some feelers out. In the meantime, listen to this.\nLalita (voice from Raj\xe2\x80\x99s phone): Hi Rajesh, this is Lalita Gupta. Your mother gave my mother your phone number to give to me. So I\xe2\x80\x99m calling you, and, ah\xe2\x80\xa6 call me back. Bye.\nRaj: Can you believe how pushy she is?\nLeonard: So don\xe2\x80\x99t call her.\nRaj: If I don\xe2\x80\x99t call her, I won\xe2\x80\x99t hear the end of it from my parents.\nLeonard: So call her.\nRaj: How can I call her, you know I can\xe2\x80\x99t talk to women.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m done, anybody else?\nHoward: Give me the phone.\nRaj: Why?\nHoward: Just give it to me. (Dials)\nRaj: What are you doing?\nHoward: Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry, you\xe2\x80\x99ll thank me. (In a fake Indian accent) Hello Lalita, Raj Koothrappali. (Raj starts to chase Howard across the room.) Yes it is good to talk to you too. So, what are you wearing. Oh, not important, so, anyhow, when would you like to meet. Friday works for me. And I call you with the time and place, but in the meantime, keep it real babe. (In own voice) You may now thank me.\nRaj: For what, making me sound like a Simpsons character?\nHoward: Fine, next time make your own date.\nRaj: I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to make this one.\nLeonard: Look on the bright side, she might turn out to be a nice, beautiful girl.\nRaj: Great, then we\xe2\x80\x99ll get married, I won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to talk to her, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll spend the rest of our lives in total silence.\nHoward: Worked for my parents.\nPenny (knocking and entering): Hi guys.\nLeonard: Oh, hey.\nPenny: I need some guinea pigs.\nSheldon: Okay, there\xe2\x80\x99s a lab animal supply company in Reseda you could try, but if your research is going to have human applications may I suggest white mice instead, their brain chemistry is far closer to ours.\nPenny: I swear to God, Sheldon, one day I\xe2\x80\x99m going to get the hang of talking to you.\nLeonard: His mom\xe2\x80\x99s been saying that for years. What\xe2\x80\x99s up?\nPenny: Well, I finally convinced the restaurant to give me a bar tending shift, so I need to practice making drinks.\nLeonard: Oh, great, well the key to acquiring proficiency in any task is repetition.\nSheldon: With certain obvious exceptions. Suicide, for example.\nPenny: So Leonard, how about it?\nLeonard: Look, Penny, we\xe2\x80\x99d love to help you, but Raj is going through some stuff right now. And besides, he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t drink, so\xe2\x80\xa6 (Raj whispers in his ear) Really? Um, Raj is going through some stuff right now and he\xe2\x80\x99d like to take up drinking.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nPenny: Okay, here you go, Leonard, one tequila sunrise.\nLeonard: Thank you. This drink is a wonderful example of how liquids with different specific gravities interact in a cylindrical container. Thank you.\nPenny: Okay, Raj, what\xe2\x80\x99ll it be? (Raj whispers in Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s ear.)\nLeonard: Whatever you recommend.\nPenny: Uh, how about a grasshopper. I make a mean grasshopper. Okay? Good. Coming up. Sheldon, what are you going to have?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99ll have a diet coke.\nPenny: Okay, can you please order a cocktail, I need to practice mixing drinks.\nSheldon: Fine. I\xe2\x80\x99ll have a virgin cuba libre.\nPenny: That\xe2\x80\x99s, um, rum and coke without the rum.\nSheldon: Yes,\nPenny: So coke.\nSheldon: Yes. And would you make it diet?\nPenny: There\xe2\x80\x99s a can in the fridge.\nSheldon: A cuba libre traditionally comes in a tall glass with a lime wedge.\nPenny: Then swim to Cuba.\nSheldon: Bartenders are supposed to have people skills.\nPenny: Okay, Raj, here you go. Alright, who\xe2\x80\x99s next?\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99d like to try a slippery nipple.\nPenny: Okay, you\xe2\x80\x99re cut off. Anybody need a refill?\nRaj: Where did my life go, Penny? One day I\xe2\x80\x99m a carefree batchelor, and the next I\xe2\x80\x99m married and driving a minivan to peewee cricket matches in suburban New Delhi.\nPenny: A\xe2\x80\xa6 are you talking to me?\nRaj: Is there another Penny here? I had such plans. I had dreams. I was going to be the Indira Gandhi of particle astro-physics. But with a penis, of course.\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s amazing.\nRaj: Ever since I was a little boy my father wanted me to be a gynaecologist like him. How can I be a gynaecologist, I can barely look a woman in the eye. You know what, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to let my parents control my future any longer, it\xe2\x80\x99s time for a showdown. Somebody give me a computer with a webcam.\nPenny: Okay, sweetie, I think that\xe2\x80\x99s the grasshopper talking.\nRaj: And it\xe2\x80\x99s about to tell my parents that I\xe2\x80\x99m not riding an elephant down the aisle with Lalita Gupta.\nPenny: Okay, calm down, no-one can make you get married. Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you just meet this girl and, see what happens.\nRaj: Haven\xe2\x80\x99t you been listening to me, I cannot talk to women.\nLeonard: Um\xe2\x80\xa6 Raj.\nHoward: No, no, let\xe2\x80\x99s see how long it takes him.\nPenny: Um, Raj, honey, you say you can\xe2\x80\x99t talk to women but\xe2\x80\xa6 you\xe2\x80\x99ve been talking to me.\nSheldon: And now we\xe2\x80\x99ll never know.\nRaj: You\xe2\x80\x99re right. I\xe2\x80\xa6 I am talking to you. Hello Penny, how are you?\nPenny: I\xe2\x80\x99m fine.\nRaj: Okay, now I just need to make sure I have a Lalita before I meet the grasshopper. It\xe2\x80\x99s a sweet green miracle.\nPenny: Okay, if you\xe2\x80\x99re going to drink on this date just promise me you won\xe2\x80\x99t overdo it.\nRaj: Overdo what? Happiness? Freedom? This warm glow inside of me that promises everything is going to be all hunky donkey?\nPenny: Yeah, that. Uh, why don\xe2\x80\x99t you bring her to my restaurant when I\xe2\x80\x99m tending the bar so I can keep an eye on you?\nRaj: Okay.\nLeonard: Wait a minute, what\xe2\x80\x99s the plan here? Let\xe2\x80\x99s say he meets her and he likes her and they get married, what\xe2\x80\x99s he going to do, stay drunk for the rest of his life?\nHoward: Worked for my parents.\nScene: The restaurant.  \nRaj: I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe I\xe2\x80\x99m sitting here next to little Lalita Gupta.\nLalita: Well, you are.\nRaj: Little Lalita. That\xe2\x80\x99s kind of fun to say. Little Lalita, Little Lalita, Little Lalita, you should try it.\nLalita: No, it\xe2\x80\x99s okay.\nRaj: You have lost so much weight! That must have been difficult for you because you were so, so fat! Do you remember?\nLalita: Yes, I do.\nRaj: Of course you do. Who could forget being that fat?\nLalita: Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been trying.\nRaj: So you\xe2\x80\x99re a dental student? Hmm, are you aware that dentists have an extremely high suicide rate? Not as high as, say, air traffic controllers, but then there are far more dentists than air traffic controllers, so in pure numbers you\xe2\x80\x99re still winning.\nLalita: Yay me!\nLeonard (to Penny): You have a drink that\xe2\x80\x99ll make him less obnoxious?\nPenny: Drinks do not work that way.\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99d say he was doing fine, look at her, last girl my mom set me up with had a moustache and a vestigial tail.\nSheldon: Sorry I\xe2\x80\x99m late.\nLeonard: What happened?\nSheldon: Nothing, I just really didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to come. Virgin diet cuba libre please.\nPenny: Okay.\nSheldon: In a tall glass, with a lime wedge.\nPenny: Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99ll wedge it right in there.\nSheldon: So, how\xe2\x80\x99s Koothrappali d\xe2\x80\xa6. oh my Lord.\nLeonard: What?\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s Princess Punchali.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m pretty sure her name\xe2\x80\x99s Lalita.\nSheldon: No, no, Princess Punchali from The Monkey and the Princess.\nHoward: Oh, yeah, I tried to watch that online, but they wanted a credit card.\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s a children\xe2\x80\x99s story.\nHoward: Oh, no it isn\xe2\x80\x99t.\nSheldon: When I was a little boy and got sick, which was most of the time, my mother would read it to me. It\xe2\x80\x99s about an Indian princess who befriends a monkey, who was mocked by all the other monkeys because he was different. For some reason I related to it quite strongly.\nPenny: I know the reason.\nLeonard: We all know the reason. Sheldon, what are you getting at?\nSheldon: That woman looks exactly like the pictures of Princess Punchali in the book. How often does one see a beloved fictional character come to life?\nHoward: Every year at Comic Con. Every day at Disneyland you can hire Snow White to come to your house. Course they prefer it if you have a kid, but\xe2\x80\xa6\nRaj: Hey guys. This is Lalita Gupta, Lalita this is Leonard and Sheldon and Howard and Penny. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it great, she isn\xe2\x80\x99t fat any more!\nSheldon: Forgive me your highness, for I am but a monkey, and it is in my nature to climb. I did not mean to gaze upon you as you comb your hair.\nLalita: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry?\nSheldon: You are the living embodiment of the beautiful Princess Punchali.\nLalita: Oh, no kidding? Oh, who is that?\nSheldon: A beloved character from an Indian folk tale.\nLalita: Oh. Us Indian, or \xe2\x80\x9ccome to our casino\xe2\x80\x9d Indian?\nSheldon: You Indian.\nLalita: Oh.\nSheldon: The resemblance is remarkable. I can practically smell the lotus blossoms woven into your ebony hair.\nLalita: Thanks. I imagine you smell very nice too.\nSheldon: I shower twice a day and wash my hands as often as I can.\nLalita: Really, so do I.\nRaj: But you\xe2\x80\x99re a dentist, he\xe2\x80\x99s nuts.\nLalita: Don\xe2\x80\x99t be insulting Rajesh. So, Sheldon, tell me more about this princess you say I look like.\nSheldon: It was said that the Gods fashioned her eyes out of the stars, and that roses were ashamed to bloom in the presence of her ruby lips.\nLalita: Oh my.\nRaj: Back off Sheldon.\nSheldon: What?\nRaj: If you do not stop hitting on my lady you will feel the full extent of my wrath.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m not hitting on her.\nLalita: And I am not your lady.\nHoward: And you have no wrath.\nRaj: You are my lady. Our parents said so. We are for all intents and purposes one hundred percent hooked up.\nLalita: Okay, let\xe2\x80\x99s get something straight here. The only reason I came tonight was to get my parents off my case, I certainly don\xe2\x80\x99t need to be getting this old world crap from you.\nSheldon: Exactly the kind of spirit with which Princess Punchali led the monkeys to freedom.\nRaj: Oh, screw Princess Punchali.\nLalita: Hey, you can\xe2\x80\x99t talk to me like that.\nRaj: But you\xe2\x80\x99re not Princess Punchali.\nSheldon: Luckily for you, she could have you beheaded.\nLalita: Sheldon, are you hungry?\nSheldon: I could eat.\nLalita: Let\xe2\x80\x99s go.\nRaj: What just happened?\nLeonard: Beats the hell out of me.\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what just happened, I just learned how to pick up Indian chicks.\nScene: The apartment. Raj is talking to his parents on the webcam.\nMrs Koothrappali: What are we supposed to say to Lalita\xe2\x80\x99s parents?\nDr Koothrappali: I play golf with her father, I won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to look at him.\nRaj: Maybe you should keep your eye on the ball, Papa.\nDr Koothrappali: Oh, now you\xe2\x80\x99re a funny man? This is not funny, Mr Funny Man.\nLeonard: Doctor and Mrs Koothrappali, in all fairness, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t entirely Raj\xe2\x80\x99s fault.\nDr Koothrappali: This is a family matter Sheldon.\nLeonard: No, I\xe2\x80\x99m Leonard.\nDr Koothrappali: Oh, sorry, you all look alike to us.\nRaj: But he\xe2\x80\x99s right, Papa, listen to him. (Sheldon enters) You! You are the one who ruined everything!\nMrs Koothrappali: Who is it? We can\xe2\x80\x99t see.\nDr Koothrappali: Turn us, turn us.\nRaj: Go ahead, tell my parents why they won\xe2\x80\x99t have any grandchildren.\nSheldon: How would I know, do you have a low sperm count?\nRaj: This has nothing to do with my sperm count.\nMrs Koothrappali: You are wearing the boxers that we sent you, aren\xe2\x80\x99t you Rajesh.\nRaj: Yes Mommy.\nMrs Koothrappali: Because you know what happens to the samosas when you wear the tidy whities.\nRaj: Can we please stop talking about my testicles? Sheldon, tell them what you did.\nSheldon: What did I do?\nLeonard: You left with his date. Friends don\xe2\x80\x99t do that to each other.\nSheldon: Oh. Alright, noted. Sorry.\nRaj: Sorry? That\xe2\x80\x99s all you can say is sorry?\nLeonard: Take it, Raj. It\xe2\x80\x99s more than I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever gotten.\nSheldon: And may I point out she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have asked me to go with her if you hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been drunk and boring.\nDr Koothrappali: Drunk?\nSheldon: And boring, her words.\nDr Koothrappali: I knew it, he moves to America and becomes an alcoholic.\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99m not an alcoholic.\nDr Koothrappali: Then why were you drunk?\nRaj: It was just this one time, Papa, I swear.\nDr Koothrappali: Are you in denial? Do we have to come over and do an intervention?\nMrs Koothrappali: Don\xe2\x80\x99t embarrass him in front of his friends.\nDr Koothrappali: Alright. Carry us outside, we want to talk to you in private.\nRaj: But Papa, please\xe2\x80\xa6.\nDr Koothrappali: Now, Rajesh.\nRaj (to Leonard and Sheldon): I have to go.   \nDr Koothrappali: Now listen to me\xe2\x80\xa6.\nRaj: Please wait until I get into the hall.\nSheldon: Okay, well, good night.\nLeonard: Hold on. What happened with you and Lalita?\nSheldon: We ate. She lectured me on the link between gum disease and heart attacks, nothing I didn\xe2\x80\x99t already know, and I came home.\nLeonard: So you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to see her again?\nSheldon: Why would I see her again? I already have a dentist. (Exits)\nLeonard: I wonder who\xe2\x80\x99s going to tell his parents they\xe2\x80\x99re not having grandchildren.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s restaurant. Sheldon is on the piano, singing \xe2\x80\x9cTo Life\xe2\x80\x9d from Fiddler on the Roof enthusiastically.\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe it, what\xe2\x80\x99s gotten into him?\nPenny: Oh, maybe a couple of virgin cuba libres that turned out to be kind of slutty.\nLeonard: You didn\xe2\x80\x99t?\nPenny: Hey, you do your experiments, I do mine.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAdvertisements\nREPORT THIS AD\nREPORT THIS AD'
