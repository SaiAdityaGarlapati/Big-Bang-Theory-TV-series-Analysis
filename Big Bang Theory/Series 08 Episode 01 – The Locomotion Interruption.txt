b'Following a \xe2\x80\x9cpreviously on\xe2\x80\x9d sequence.\nScene: A railway station. Sheldon is wearing no trousers.\nSheldon: Excuse me. Is it at all possible that you\xe2\x80\x99re knitting a pair of pants? Oh, well, no, you\xe2\x80\x99re understandably terrified. But, you know, allow me to explain. 45 days ago, um, I embarked on a railroad journey of healing because my university was making me do string theory, and my favorite comic book store burned down, and when my room mate got engaged, my girlfriend wanted to move in with me, which was no doubt a ploy just to see my, well, excuse my language, but my bathing suit parts. Uh, sir, may I use your phone?\nMan: I don\xe2\x80\x99t think so.\nSheldon: Yeah, well, I understand that I\xe2\x80\x99m half naked, but there is a reasonable explanation. While I slept in my sleeper car, all my possessions were stolen. Now, typically, I wear pyjamas, but I recently adopted a hobo lifestyle and pyjamas are the sleep-pants of the Man. I\xe2\x80\x99ll have you know, Mahatma Gandhi wore no pants and a nation rallied behind him. My good man, now, before you walk away, I know that I may appear deranged, but I am, in fact, a world-renowned physicist. Ask me the difference between a boson and a fermion. Go ahead, ask. Bosons have integer spin, fermions have half-integer spin. My legs are getting cold. Why won\xe2\x80\x99t anybody help me?\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: Morning.\nPenny: Hi. Want to do yoga with me?\nLeonard: Um, let me just have some coffee first, and then I\xe2\x80\x99ll have the strength to tell you how much I won\xe2\x80\x99t be doing that. (Phone rings) Hello?\nSheldon: Hello, Leonard.\nLeonard: Hey, buddy. Good to hear your voice.\nSheldon: Uh, I\xe2\x80\x99m in Kingman, Arizona, and, uh, I need you to come pick me up.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99d love to. I\xe2\x80\x99m just about to do yoga with Penny.\nSheldon: Leonard, I\xe2\x80\x99m at the police station. I was robbed. They took my phone, my wallet, my iPad, everything.\nLeonard: Oh, my God, are you okay?\nSheldon: No, I\xe2\x80\x99m not okay. Uh, I\xe2\x80\x99m wearing borrowed pants, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have I.D., and one of the officers here won\xe2\x80\x99t stop calling me chicken legs.\nLeonard: Okay. Uh, I\xe2\x80\x99ll, I\xe2\x80\x99ll come get you. What\xe2\x80\x99s the address?\nPenny: Hey, what\xe2\x80\x99s going on?\nLeonard: He got all of his stuff stolen.\nPenny: Oh.\n  Sheldon: 2530 East Andy Devine Avenue,\nLeonard: Okay.\nSheldon: Hurry.\nLeonard: Sheldon, hang tight. Hey, do you want me to bring anything?\nSheldon: Oh, yes, please. A pair of pants. And my toothbrush. Yeah, and my mail. And a really good comeback for chicken legs, because \xe2\x80\x9cI know you are, but what am I?\xe2\x80\x9d was met with stony silence.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99ll be there as soon as I can.\nPenny: Is he okay?\nLeonard: Yeah, he\xe2\x80\x99s fine, he\xe2\x80\x99s just a little rattled.\nPenny: Oh.\nLeonard: Feel like driving to Arizona with me?\nPenny: I can\xe2\x80\x99t, I have that job interview.\nLeonard: Oh, right.\nPenny: Besides, I don\xe2\x80\x99t need six hours of your hair is different, why did you change your hair? I\xe2\x80\x99m holding my breath until your hair grows back.\nLeonard: All right, fine. Hey, can you think of a reason I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t invite Amy to come with me?\nPenny: Nope.\nLeonard: Come on, you didn\xe2\x80\x99t even try.\nScene: Howard\xe2\x80\x99s car.\nRaj: Thanks for the lift.\nHoward: What\xe2\x80\x99s wrong with your car?\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99m having my windows untinted.\nHoward: Why?\nRaj: Got a hot girlfriend now. I want the haters to know.\nHoward: What are you talking about? No one\xe2\x80\x99s paying attention to you.\nRaj: Wow. How\xe2\x80\x99s that Hater-Ade taste, bro? Hey, this isn\xe2\x80\x99t the way to work.\nHoward: I just want to pop in and make sure Ma\xe2\x80\x99s okay.\nRaj: I thought Stuart was looking after her.\nHoward: He was, but now that her cast is off, he moved out. And honestly, I\xe2\x80\x99m kind of glad. It was getting a little weird.\nRaj: How so?\nHoward: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, they\xe2\x80\x99re, chummy.\nRaj: Like us?\nHoward: No, not like us. Creepy chummy, like you and your dog.\nRaj: She feeds him out of her own mouth?\nHoward: I mean, he calls her Debbie, she calls him Stewie and they\xe2\x80\x99re all giggly around each other. And believe me, when food goes in that mouth, it does not come out.\nRaj: So are you worried because he\xe2\x80\x99s replacing you as a son or are you worried because he\xe2\x80\x99s becoming her lover?\nHoward: First of all, no one can replace me as a son. I\xe2\x80\x99m her little matzo ball. And secondly, my mother is well past having any kind of sex life.\nRaj: Okay, okay. Although many older women lead vibrant, active\xe2\x80\xa6\nHoward: I said well past it.\nScene: Kingman Police Station.\nSheldon: Excuse me, Officer Hernandez? Any leads on the person who stole my belongings?\nHernandez: Not yet.\nSheldon: Well, perhaps I can help. Sherlock Holmes always says when you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth. Now, have, have you tried doing that?\nHernandez: Nope.\nSheldon: Well, maybe you should. There\xe2\x80\x99s lots of books called Sherlock Holmes, and there\xe2\x80\x99s no books called Officer Hernandez.\nScene: Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s car.\nLeonard: Thanks again for coming. Six hours was gonna be a long drive by myself.\nAmy: My pleasure. And I\xe2\x80\x99m not angry at all that my boyfriend was in trouble and called you instead of me. I love that,\nLeonard: Yeah, time\xe2\x80\x99s gonna fly by.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nPenny: I haven\xe2\x80\x99t been on a job interview in years. I\xe2\x80\x99m really nervous.\nBernadette: Don\xe2\x80\x99t be. You are built for pharmaceutical sales. You\xe2\x80\x99re cute, you\xe2\x80\x99re flirty and started that like there were gonna be three things.\nPenny: I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any experience in sales. Unless you count the bikini car wash I did in high school. But you already made me take that off my r\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9.\nBernadette: This job is a lot like being a waitress, except instead of pushing the fish tacos \xe2\x80\x99cause they\xe2\x80\x99re about to go bad, you\xe2\x80\x99re just pushing our antidepressants before the FDA finds out they may cause rectal bleeding.\nPenny: They do?\nBernadette: Maybe. But like our lawyers say, the world is full of things that can cause a rectum to bleed. Anyway, I talked you up to Dan. He\xe2\x80\x99s the guy who\xe2\x80\x99ll be interviewing you.\nPenny: Oh, I really appreciate this. I just hope I\xe2\x80\x99m not in over my head.\nBernadette: You\xe2\x80\x99ll be fine. Just be yourself.\nPenny: I wish I felt more confident.\nBernadette: Penny, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have put you up for this job if I didn\xe2\x80\x99t think you could handle it.\nPenny: Oh, thank you, but maybe I should cancel.\nBernadette: It\xe2\x80\x99s too late to cancel. You\xe2\x80\x99re going.\nPenny: But I don\xe2\x80\x99t know anything about pharmaceuticals.\nBernadette: Oh, I understand. You want to do something you\xe2\x80\x99re already good at. I know. Why don\xe2\x80\x99t I get you a job at the Sitting Around All Day Wearing Yoga Pants Factory?\nPenny: They\xe2\x80\x99re comfortable.\nScene: Mrs Wolowitz\xe2\x80\x99s house.\nHoward: Ma, I hope you\xe2\x80\x99re decent. Raj is here. You just started seeing naked women again, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t want you to be confused about where the boobs should be.\nStuart: Oh, hey, guys. What are you doing here?\nHoward: Uh, what are you doing here? I thought you moved out.\nStuart: Oh, yeah, I was going to, and then Debbie and I got to talking over dinner the other night. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t have any place to go, she likes having me around, so we both said, why leave? at the same time. It was precious.\nHoward: It\xe2\x80\x99s not that precious.\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99d like to back you up, but it sounds like it was pretty precious.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Stewie, I can\xe2\x80\x99t find my glasses.\nStuart: Be right there, Deb Deb. They\xe2\x80\x99re probably on her head.\nHoward: Or in her neck. Listen. You staying here seems like something she would\xe2\x80\x99ve talked to me about.\nStuart: Well, maybe if you called your mother more often, you\xe2\x80\x99d know.\nRaj: It wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t kill you to pick up the phone.\nScene: Kingman Police Station.\nSheldon: Any word on my stolen items?\nHernandez: We\xe2\x80\x99re doing everything we can.\nSheldon: You know, Sherlock Holmes liked to use cocaine to sharpen his focus. But I\xe2\x80\x99m sure those Cool Ranch Doritos are doing the trick.\nLeonard: Sheldon.\nSheldon: Leonard. Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m so happy to see you.\nAmy: Are you okay?\nSheldon: Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m fine. Why did you come?\nAmy: What do you mean, why did I come? You\xe2\x80\x99re my boyfriend. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen you in over a month. I just drove six hours to help you out. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you have anything to say besides why did you come?\nSheldon: I do, but, I feel uncomfortable saying it out loud in front of these police officers.\nAmy: Fine. Whisper it.\nSheldon (whispers): Shotgun.\nScene: Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s car.\nLeonard: So, Sheldon, tell us about your trip. Where\xe2\x80\x99d you go?\nSheldon: Where didn\xe2\x80\x99t I go? I went to New York, Chicago, Atlanta, Denver, Seattle.\nLeonard: How were they?\nSheldon: Oh, I have no idea. I never left the train station.\nLeonard: Hang on. You travelled across the entire country and never left a train station?\nSheldon: Why would I? That\xe2\x80\x99s where all the cool trains are.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, so you never went outside?\nSheldon: Or had a single piece of fruit.\nScene: Pharmaceutical Company Office.\nDan: So, why do you think you\xe2\x80\x99d make a good pharmaceutical sales rep?\nPenny: Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m a people person. People like me. Some of my favourite people are people. I feel like I\xe2\x80\x99m saying people a lot. People, people, people. Okay, I\xe2\x80\x99m done.\nDan: You sure?\nPenny: People. Yes.\nDan: Good. So, how do you feel your previous job experience has prepared you for a career like this?\nPenny: Uh, well, as a waitress, sales was a big part of my job. I mean, believe me, I convinced a lot of very large customers, who should not be eating cheesecake, to have more cheesecake. I mean, one of those chubsters even had an insulin pump.\nDan: Uh-huh. I have an insulin pump.\nPenny: People.\nScene: Howard\xe2\x80\x99s car.\nHoward: It\xe2\x80\x99s weird, right? A grown man in his thirties living with my mother.\nRaj: That is weird. I thought he was, like, 45.\nHoward: Come on, you don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s a little odd?\nRaj: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I mean, she\xe2\x80\x99s lonely. He needs a place to stay. I doubt there\xe2\x80\x99s any funny business going on. And even if there was, who cares? They\xe2\x80\x99re both adults.\nHoward: Who cares? You wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t care if I slept with your mom?\nRaj: You know what? You\xe2\x80\x99re my best friend, and she\xe2\x80\x99s in a bad marriage. I give you my blessing.\nHoward: This is stupid. I\xe2\x80\x99m just gonna call my mother and be honest with her.\nRaj: \xe2\x80\x98Cause that\xe2\x80\x99s what little matzo balls do.\nStuart (voice on answerphone): This is Debbie.\nMrs Wolowitz (voice on answerphone): And this is Stuart.\nTogether: Just kidding.\nStuart (voice on answerphone): Leave a message.\nRaj: This is the part where you talk.\nScene: Pharmaceutical Company Office.\nDan: All right, let\xe2\x80\x99s say a physician was prescribing one of our competitor\xe2\x80\x99s drugs. How would you convince them to switch to ours?\nPenny: Um, any chance his car needs to be washed by a girl in a bikini? No. Okay, I\xe2\x80\x99m really sorry for wasting your time.\nDan: Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry about it. Thanks for stopping by.\nPenny: Okay, thanks. Um, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, listen, could you do me a favour and not tell Bernadette how badly I blew this interview? She\xe2\x80\x99ll get upset. And honestly I\xe2\x80\x99m a, a little terrified of her.\nDan: Wait, wait. You\xe2\x80\x99re scared of Bernadette?\nPenny: Yeah, kind of.\nDan: I thought it was just me. Everyone thinks she\xe2\x80\x99s so nice with that squeaky little voice.\nPenny: I know, but she\xe2\x80\x99s kind of a bully.\nDan: Wll, she is. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t even want to meet you, but, uh, I was too scared to say no to her.\nPenny: Me, too.\nDan: Yeah, yeah. One, one time, I had, I had to tell her we were cutting the, the research funding for one of the drugs she was developing.\nPenny: What happened?\nDan: I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do it. She\xe2\x80\x99s still working on it. Oh, we\xe2\x80\x99re not gonna tell her about this, right?\nPenny: Oh, my God, no.\nScene: Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s car.\nSheldon: At the hot dog stand in the Denver train station, Heinz ketchup. At the hot dog stand in the Salt Lake City train station, Heinz ketchup. At the hot dog stand in the Indianapolis train station?\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t care.\nSheldon: Wrong. Hunt\xe2\x80\x99s. Hey, Amy, what do you say? You ready to move on to the mustard round?\nAmy: Have you not noticed that I\xe2\x80\x99ve been sitting back here quietly stewing for the past two hours?\nSheldon: I just thought you were bad at the game.\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99m mad at you. How could you just go away like that without even saying good-bye, and then call Leonard for help instead of me?\nSheldon: Amy, may I please have a moment of privacy to speak with my roommate?\nAmy: We\xe2\x80\x99re in a moving car. What do you expect me to do? Stick my fingers in my ears?\nSheldon: Well, I was thinking put your head out the window like a dog, but that\xe2\x80\x99ll work. Please? This\xe2\x80\x99ll be quick. Leonard? As soon as we get home, I want to have coitus with Amy. Okay, she can\xe2\x80\x99t hear. The reason I called you is because I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want Amy to know I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t make it on my own.\nLeonard: What\xe2\x80\x99s the big deal?\nSheldon: Oh, of course it\xe2\x80\x99s no big deal to you. You idolize me, and nothing could ever knock me off that pedestal you put me on.\nLeonard: Well, yeah, it\xe2\x80\x99s true. You, you are a god to me.\nAmy: Can I stop now?\nLeonard: Just tell her.\nSheldon: I called Leonard because I failed. And I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want you to think less of me.\nAmy: You were worried about that?\nSheldon: Yes.\nAmy: Sheldon, it\xe2\x80\x99s okay with me that you\xe2\x80\x99re not perfect.\nSheldon: Can I have one more moment with Leonard?\nAmy: Sure.\nSheldon: Amy just hurt my feelings. I want to break up with her.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nHoward: Now, I never thought I\xe2\x80\x99d say this, but I\xe2\x80\x99m kind of excited to see Sheldon.\nBernadette: I never thought I\xe2\x80\x99d say this, but Penny got a job today.\nHoward: She did?\nBernadette: Well, the only reason she got it is \xe2\x80\x99cause the guy who interviewed her loves me.\nHoward (answering a knock on the door): What do you want?\nStuart: I, uh, kind of got the feeling you might not be okay with me staying at your mom\xe2\x80\x99s.\nHoward: You\xe2\x80\x99re right, I\xe2\x80\x99m not. I think it\xe2\x80\x99s weird.\nBernadette: Howie?\nHoward: It is. He\xe2\x80\x99s a grown man. He\xe2\x80\x99s just gonna live there rent-free? How is that gonna motivate him to get off his butt and get a job? I mean, do you even have a plan?\nStuart: Hey, you\xe2\x80\x99re not my father, okay? And besides, your mother and I were talking\xe2\x80\xa6\nHoward: Your mother and I? You\xe2\x80\x99re not my father.\nStuart: I didn\xe2\x80\x99t say I was your father.\nHoward: Well, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t say I was your father.\nBernadette: Okay, calm down. You\xe2\x80\x99re not his father, he\xe2\x80\x99s not your father. Nobody\xe2\x80\x99s anybody\xe2\x80\x99s father.\nStuart: I, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry you don\xe2\x80\x99t like my life choices, but it\xe2\x80\x99s my life.\nHoward: Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s my house, it\xe2\x80\x99s my rules.\nStuart: Oh, oh, okay, Dad, if I mow the lawn, can I have my allowance?\nBernadette: Hey, don\xe2\x80\x99t you take that sarcastic tone with him.\nStuart: I don\xe2\x80\x99t have to listen to you.\nHoward: Don\xe2\x80\x99t talk to her like that. That is my mother. Wife. My wife. I said my wife.\nStuart: You know what? This isn\xe2\x80\x99t getting us anywhere. When you\xe2\x80\x99re ready to apologize, you know where to find me.\nHoward: Yeah, in my house.\nStuart: That\xe2\x80\x99s right, sucka.\nScene: The stairwell.\nSheldon: I wish I\xe2\x80\x99d never gone on that trip. I feel no better now than when I left.\nAmy: But you still accomplished something.\nLeonard: Yeah. If you had told anyone that you were going away on a train by yourself across the country, do you know what they would have said?\nSheldon: That I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do it?\nLeonard: Exactly. Right after they said yeah.\nAmy: But you did do it. So what if it didn\xe2\x80\x99t all go your way? That\xe2\x80\x99s what makes it an adventure.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s a good point. You know, I\xe2\x80\x99m a lot like Gandalf the Grey. He fought the Balrog and emerged stronger than ever as Gandalf the White. I was robbed of my phone and pants, and I, too, came back stronger. And whiter, too, \xe2\x80\x99cause I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t in direct sunlight for six weeks.\nAmy: See? This trip was good for you.\nSheldon: Indeed. I was the world\xe2\x80\x99s smartest caterpillar. And then after pupating in our nation\xe2\x80\x99s railway system, I\xe2\x80\x99ve burst forth as the world\xe2\x80\x99s smartest butterfly.\nLeonard: Butterfly could\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten himself home from Arizona.\nSheldon: Yeah, I feel renewed. I\xe2\x80\x99m ready to deal with any changes that come my way.\nAll: Hey.\nPenny: Hey, look who\xe2\x80\x99s back.\nSheldon: Your hair is different. You changed your hair. I can\xe2\x80\x99t take this. I\xe2\x80\x99m out.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Would you like to see pictures from my trip?\nPenny: I thought your phone got stolen.\nSheldon: Yeah, it did, but luckily all my photos got backed up to the Cloud.\nLeonard: And you thought they all had a silver lining.\nSheldon: Here, day one, uh, this was the seat I was going to sit in but didn\xe2\x80\x99t because there were cracker crumbs on it. As it was first class, I suspect Ritz. This is the train bathroom. This is the Imodium I took so I would never have to use the train bathroom.\nPenny: I cannot believe you travelled the entire country and never left the train station.\nSheldon: I know. You know, I almost died in a fire in Des Moines, but I stayed put. FYI, that\xe2\x80\x99s when the Imodium gave out.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
