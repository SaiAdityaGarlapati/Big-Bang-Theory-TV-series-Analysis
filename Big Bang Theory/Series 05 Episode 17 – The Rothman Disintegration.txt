b'Scene: A corridor at the university\nRaj: It was a nice retirement party.\nHoward: I guess. Still, it\xe2\x80\x99s a shame Professor Rothman was forced to step down.\nLeonard: What choice did the university have? He snapped. It happens to theoretical physicists all the time.\nHoward: I wonder how long Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s got.\nSheldon: These shrimp are all the same size. There\xe2\x80\x99s no the logical order to eat them in.\nLeonard: Can\xe2\x80\x99t be very long.\nRaj: Hey, look, there\xe2\x80\x99s Rothman\xe2\x80\x99s empty office. Sad.\nLeonard: Yeah.\nSheldon: Mm, indeed.\nHoward: So sad.\nSheldon: Dibs.\nKripke: What\xe2\x80\x99s up, fewwas?\nSheldon: What are you doing here, Kripke?\nKripke: Ah, measuwing my new office for dwapes.\nSheldon: This is not your office. It hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been assigned yet.\nKripke: Well, I called dibs at the Chwistmas party when Pwofessor Wothman twied to have intercourse with the toys for tots cowwection box.\nSheldon: Dibs? This is a university, not a playground. Offices are not assigned because someone called dibs.\nLeonard: You just called dibs.\nSheldon: Shut it. Offices are assigned by seniority. I arrived at the university first.\nKripke: I awwived at the office first. I\xe2\x80\x99m the pwoverbial earwy bird.\nRothman (entering, naked): Gentlemen.\nAll: Professor Rothman.\nRothman: Good evening.\nAll: Good evening.\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99m glad that men are wearing hats again. They\xe2\x80\x99re so distinguished.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nAmy: I got you a little something.\nPenny: A little something? Oh, it\xe2\x80\xa6 what, this is huge.\nAmy: What\xe2\x80\x99s huge is what you\xe2\x80\x99ve done for me.\nPenny: Oh, no, Amy, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t done anything.\nAmy: No, no, before I met you, I was a mousy wallflower. But look at me now. I\xe2\x80\x99m like some kind of downtown hipster party girl. With a posse, a boyfriend and a new lace bra that hooks in the front, of all things. Open it. Open it.\nPenny: Okay. (Opens parcel to find a huge and not at all flattering painting of Penny and Amy)\nAmy: I wanted to get you something you didn\xe2\x80\x99t have.\nPenny: Wow. I-I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to s\xe2\x80\xa6 Wow.\nAmy: Do you like it?\nPenny: Do I like it? Wow.\nAmy: So, uh, where are you gonna hang it?\nPenny: Oh, my God. Hang it. Wow. Um, you know, I\xe2\x80\x99d have to go get a hook and nails and a hammer and\xe2\x80\xa6\nAmy: No problem.\nPenny: Oh, look. You, huh, you just, you got it all right there. Wow.\nScene: A bathroom at the university.\nSheldon: I found him. He\xe2\x80\x99s in the bathroom. President Siebert?\nSiebert: Can\xe2\x80\x99t this wait?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. We just need a word.\nSiebert: Now? You realize I\xe2\x80\x99m your boss, and I am holding my penis?\nKripke: Sheldon, give the man some pwivacy. I\xe2\x80\x99m sowwy. This guy\xe2\x80\x99s got no wespect for boundawies.\nSiebert: What do you want?\nKripke: Will you tell this wunatic that Pwofessor Wothman\xe2\x80\x99s office is wightfully mine?\nSiebert: Can\xe2\x80\x99t you take this up with your department chairman?\nSheldon: We tried. His assistant said he was on sabbatical. Although we distinctly heard his office window open and shut.\nSiebert: Gentlemen, there\xe2\x80\x99s a task I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to accomplish here, and I\xe2\x80\x99m having trouble doing it.\nSheldon: Oh, my. President Siebert, I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to be an alarmist, but difficulty initiating a urine stream could be a symptom of benign prostatic hyperplasia. If you\xe2\x80\x99re interested, I can send you a link to a YouTube video that\xe2\x80\x99ll show you how to perform your own rectal exam. Yeah, uh, helpful hint, trim your nails first.\nKripke: Ignore him, Pwesident Siebert. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure a young man such as yourself has a perfectwy healthy pwostate.\nSheldon: Oh, he\xe2\x80\x99s just trying to butter you up. And for the record, butter is an excellent lubricant for your rectal exam.\nSiebert: Gentlemen, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to allow the two of you to work this out because A, you\xe2\x80\x99re both brilliant scientists, and B, as far as who gets Rothman\xe2\x80\x99s office, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t give the furry crack of a rat\xe2\x80\x99s behind.\nKripke: Well, as wong as we\xe2\x80\x99re here, I might as well take a weak.\nSheldon: Kripke?\nKripke: Yes?\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re in my spot.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nBernadette: That is big.\nPenny: So big.\nBernadette: And ugly.\nPenny: So ugly. What am I gonna do?\nBernadette: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. You can\xe2\x80\x99t take it down. You\xe2\x80\x99ll break her heart. Look at that face. That enormous, unsettling, crazy face.\nPenny: Is there any chance I\xe2\x80\x99ll learn to love it?\nBernadette: That depends. Do you like pictures of yourself where you look like a man?\nPenny: All right, it\xe2\x80\x99s got to go.\nBernadette: What will you tell Amy?\nPenny: How about I tell her the painting makes you feel jealous because you\xe2\x80\x99re not in it?\nBernadette: Nuh-uh. What if she gets me one? I already have a picture of me and Howard\xe2\x80\x99s mom getting our hair cornrowed in Venice Beach. I\xe2\x80\x99ve suffered enough.\nPenny: Well, I guess I could take it down and put it up when she comes over, but it\xe2\x80\x99s kind of heavy.\nBernadette: Mmm, too bad you\xe2\x80\x99re not as strong as the dude in the painting.\nScene: The apartment.\nRaj: Would you look at this? I paid twenty five dollars to some kid on eBay for a handcrafted Harry Potter wand. He sent me a stick. He went into his backyard, he picked up a stick.\nHoward: It\xe2\x80\x99s numbered.\nRaj: Ooh, limited edition. Nice.\nSheldon (knock on door): Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99ll be Kripke.\nLeonard: What\xe2\x80\x99s he doing here?\nSheldon: We\xe2\x80\x99re going to work this office situation out like gentlemen. And if that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to poison his tea.\nKripke: Cooper.\nSheldon: Kripke. Come in. I\xe2\x80\x99m making tea. Would you like a cup?\nKripke: Am I weawing a summer fwock? No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want tea. Wet\xe2\x80\x99s get down to bwass tacks.\nSheldon: Fine. In the interest of preserving our friendship\xe2\x80\xa6\nKripke: We\xe2\x80\x99re not fwiends.\nSheldon: Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s a little hard to hear, but all right. As you know, the essence of diplomacy is compromise. With that in mind, I propose the following. I will take Rothman\xe2\x80\x99s office, and you will find a way to be okay with that.\nKripke: How about I take Wothman\xe2\x80\x99s office, and you go suck a wemon?\nSheldon: You sure I can\xe2\x80\x99t get you that cup of tea?\nRaj: How about you decide this with Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock?\nKripke: What the fwig is that?\nSheldon: Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock was created by Internet pioneer Sam Kass as an improvement on the classic game Rock-Paper-Scissors. All hail Sam Kass.\nAll: Hail.\nKripke: How does it work?\nSheldon: Oh, it\xe2\x80\x99s very simple. Scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock, rock crushes lizard, lizard poisons Spock, Spock smashes scissors, scissors decapitates lizard, lizard eats paper, paper disproves Spock, Spock vaporizes rock, and as it always has, rock crushes scissors.\nKripke: I\xe2\x80\x99m sowwy. Can you wepeat that?\nSheldon: Well, of course. Scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock, rock crushes lizard, lizard poisons Spock, Spock smashes scissors, scissors decapitates lizard, lizard eats paper, paper disproves Spock, Spock vaporizes rock, and as it always has, rock crushes scissors.\nKripke: Almost got it. One more time.\nSheldon: Surely. Scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock, rock\xe2\x80\xa6\nHoward: Sheldon, stop. He\xe2\x80\x99s screwing with you.\nSheldon: Is he? Well, then, it seems we have reached an impasse. I see no other option than to challenge you to a duel. I\xe2\x80\x99d smack you with a glove, but just last week I packed away my winter things.\nHoward: It\xe2\x80\x99s the 21st century. You can\xe2\x80\x99t have a duel.\nLeonard: H-h-h-hang on, Howard. Barry, how good of a shot are you?\nSheldon: Not pistols. Minds. A trivia contest, and you may choose the field of battle. Star Trek trivia, Star Trek: Next Generation trivia, Star Trek: Deep Space Nine trivia, Star Trek: Voyager trivia, or model trains.\nKripke: You have a compwete advantage in twivia. You have an eidetic memowy. Pwus, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t watched Star Twek since I discovered the stwip cwub near my apartment has a fwee buffet.\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s gonna be hard to find something you\xe2\x80\x99re both equally good at.\nRaj: Is there anything you\xe2\x80\x99re both equally bad at?\nBoth: Sports.\nScene: A basketball court.\nLeonard: All right, this is one-on-one. First person to five wins the office. Any questions? Yes, Sheldon?\nSheldon: Five what?\nLeonard: Balls in the basket. (Throws ball to Sheldon)\nSheldon (dodging out of the way): Ew!\nLater. Sheldon dribbling ball, approached Kripke, throws it wildly at a pile of mats in the corner.\nKripke: It\xe2\x80\x99s out, wight?\nLater. Kripke, dribbling ball, watched by Sheldon, dribbles it all the way into the back wall.\nKripke: Time. Wan out of woom.\nLeonard: You know all those terrible things bullies used to do to us?\nRaj: Yeah.\nLeonard: I get it.\nLater. Kripke chases ball across room chased by Sheldon. Sounds of collision. Sheldon chases ball back across the room chased by Kripke.\nLater. Ball hits Sheldon in back of head.\nSheldon: Hey! He did that on purpose,\nLeonard: No, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t. Nothing that\xe2\x80\x99s happening here is being done on purpose. Okay, uh, forget one-on-one. Let\xe2\x80\x99s try a free throw contest. First person who makes a basket wins the office.\nKripke: Making it too easy there, Hofstadter.\nLeonard: No. No, I\xe2\x80\x99m not.\nSheldon: Use the force, Sheldon. Use the force. (Throws ball. It goes about two feet in front of him.) I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna need more force.\nKripke: Aw wight, Cooper, pwepare to have your heart bwoken. (Throws ball up. It hits the ceiling and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t come down.) Do I get points for that?\nLater. A trampoline has been added. Sheldon tries first, ball hits backboard, bounces back in his face. Kripke tries next, with a run up, ends up crashing into the back wall again.\nLater.\nLeonard: All right, we gave it 45 minutes. It\xe2\x80\x99s no longer funny. Let\xe2\x80\x99s try something else.\nSheldon: What do you propose?\nLeonard: Uh, on the count of three, both of you bounce the balls as hard as you can. The highest bounce wins the office.\nKripke: Oh, you are going down, Cooper.\nSheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t think so, Kripke. I\xe2\x80\x99ve bounced many a rubber ball in my day.\nLeonard: All right, that\xe2\x80\x99s enough trash talk. One, two, three.\nHoward: Sheldon was higher.\nLeonard: Congratulations, Sheldon. You win office.\nSheldon: Who\xe2\x80\x99s unsatisfactory in P.E. now?\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nAmy: Oh, what a great movie.\nPenny: I cannot believe you\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen Grease.\nAmy: My mother didn\xe2\x80\x99t allow me to watch it. She was afraid it might encourage me to join a gang.\nBernadette: I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to go. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to get up early. My company\xe2\x80\x99s testing a new steroid that supposedly doesn\xe2\x80\x99t shrink testicles, and the last one there has to do the measuring.\nAmy: I guess I should get going, too. Good night, painting Penny. Good night, real Penny.\nPenny: Good night, real Amy.\nAmy: You don\xe2\x80\x99t have to say good night to painting Amy, \xe2\x80\x99cause she\xe2\x80\x99s never leaving.\nBernadette: Good night, real Penny.\nPenny: Bye.\nBernadette: Good night, transvestite Penny.\nPenny: Ah, okay. Let us take you off the wall. Out of sight, out of mind. I wish.\nAmy (entering): You know, can I borrow that movie? Those singing hooligans really got my motor running.\nPenny: Sure, sure. Enjoy. I mean, get it back to me when you can, or, you know what, actually, you keep it. It\xe2\x80\x99s just going to be my gift to you. Bye.\nAmy: Thank you. Wait. Where\xe2\x80\x99d the painting go?\nPenny: It\xe2\x80\x99s right over there.\nAmy: Why?\nPenny: I have no idea. That is weird.\nAmy: You hate it.\nPenny: No. No, no. It\xe2\x80\x99s just, it\xe2\x80\x99s a little big.\nAmy: I feel like an idiot.\nPenny: No, come on, you\xe2\x80\x99re not an idiot. Look, just help me put it back up.\nAmy: Why? So you can just take it down when I leave? I don\xe2\x80\x99t need your pity.\nPenny: Oh, Amy, come on.\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99m just glad I didn\xe2\x80\x99t go for the sculpture.\nScene: Rothman\xe2\x80\x99s office.\nSheldon: Ah, the spoils. I see why victors love them.\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99m happy for you, Sheldon. But I have to admit I\xe2\x80\x99m going to miss sharing an office with you.\nSheldon: Oh, of course you are. Feel free to drop by any time.\nRaj: Thank you.\nSheldon: Yeah. Call first. (Pushes him out. Closes door. Rothman is standing naked behind it.)\nRothman: Oh. Hello.\nSheldon: Professor Rothman. This isn\xe2\x80\x99t your office any more. You\xe2\x80\x99re retired.\nRothman: I think the word you\xe2\x80\x99re looking for is invisible.\nScene: Amy\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nPenny: I came to say I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.\nAmy: Don\xe2\x80\x99t bother.\nPenny: Oh, Amy, please.\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99m so humiliated. I sat there the whole time that we were watching Grease, thinking you liked the painting.\nPenny: I know.\nAmy: I was a fool from Summer Lovin\xe2\x80\x99 to the very last rama lama lama ke ding a de dinga a dong.\nPenny: You\xe2\x80\x99re right. You\xe2\x80\x99re absolutely right. I should have been honest with you and told you the gift was too much.\nAmy: Yes, too much. Because our friendship is fundamentally asymmetrical. I clearly like you more than you like me.\nPenny: I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you can put a number on how much one person likes another.\nAmy: I bought you a painting that\xe2\x80\x99s 12 square feet in area. There\xe2\x80\x99s a number.\nPenny: Amy, come on\xe2\x80\xa6\nAmy: If you don\xe2\x80\x99t like feet, you can try dollars. The painting set me back three grand.\nPenny: Three gr\xe2\x80\xa6 Oh, my God! Look, look, Amy, all you need to know is, you are my friend and I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to lose you out of my life.\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, I\xe2\x80\x99m just having trouble believing you right now.\nPenny: Grab your hammer.\nAmy: No. Damage is done.\nPenny: Okay, look, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to say this, but the real reason I took the painting down was because it made Bernadette very jealous.\nAmy: Oh, my goodness, how could I have not seen that? The painting is a constant reminder that of the three of us, she is the least cool.\nPenny: Yeah, th-th-th-that\xe2\x80\x99s what it is, so\xe2\x80\xa6\nAmy: You have such a good heart.\nPenny: Huh, I try.\nAmy: Come on.\nPenny: Well where are we going?\nAmy: We\xe2\x80\x99re going to go put this painting back up in your apartment.\nPenny: Well, what about Bernadette?\nAmy: Oh, screw her. She\xe2\x80\x99s just lucky we let her hang out with us.\nScene: Rothman\xe2\x80\x99s office. Sheldon is trying to affix paper over a fiercely blowing air vent.\nLeonard: What are you doing?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to raise the temperature in here before my nipples tear through my shirt.\nHoward: Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you just turn up the thermostat?\nSheldon: Aha! Good question. It turns out the thermostat for my new office isn\xe2\x80\x99t in my new office. No. It\xe2\x80\x99s next door, in Professor Davenport\xe2\x80\x99s office, who is currently enjoying the hot flashes associated with menopause.\nLeonard: Why is there a hole here?\nSheldon: Why is there a hole in my new office? I\xe2\x80\x99ve narrowed it down to two possibilities: There was something in the wall that someone outside the wall wanted, or the more disturbing, there was something in the wall that wanted out.\nRaj: Well, at least you finally got a window that opens. That\xe2\x80\x99s nice.\nSheldon: Is it? Listen.\nRaj: What, you don\xe2\x80\x99t like wind chimes?\nSheldon: No, I hate them, but it gets worse. There it is.\nHoward: The bird?\nSheldon: Yeah, It\xe2\x80\x99s completely out of tune with the wind chimes.\nRaj: So?\nSheldon: You don\xe2\x80\x99t get it, do you? That\xe2\x80\x99s a mockingbird. Mockingbirds can change their song, which means he\xe2\x80\x99s out of tune on purpose. He\xe2\x80\x99s mocking me. Oh dear. There it is again. Do you feel it?\nHoward: The growing realization that you are one wacky bastard? Yep.\nSheldon: No. The vibration. We are directly underneath the geology lab, and they\xe2\x80\x99re running their confounded sieve shakers again. Hey, gravel monkeys, if you need to shake rocks, try jiggling your heads around!\nLeonard: Sheldon, relax.\nSheldon: How can I relax? My nervous system is being stretched out like the strings of a harp and plucked by holes and birds and wind and the low-hanging scrotum of the difficult-to-evict Professor Rothman.\nLeonard: If you\xe2\x80\x99re not happy, why don\xe2\x80\x99t you just let Kripke have the office?\nSheldon: What, and let him win? Do I look crazy to you? We\xe2\x80\x99re trying to think down here, you geode-loving feldspar jockeys! (To the bird) And you, the notes are C, D, E, G and A. You pick one or I am chopping down that tree!\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nPenny: How\xe2\x80\x99s that?\nAmy: Little higher on the right.\nPenny: Now?\nAmy: Little more. No. That\xe2\x80\x99s got it.\nPenny: Yeah, okay. That\xe2\x80\x99s, uh, that\xe2\x80\x99s good.\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99ll let you in on a little secret.\nPenny: Mm.\nAmy: Originally we were painted nude. But I had him add clothes, \xe2\x80\x99cause I thought it was an unnecessary challenge to our heterosexuality.\nPenny: Yeah, good call.\nAmy: But if you ever change your mind, all it would take is some warm, soapy water and a couple of sponges.\nPenny: You\xe2\x80\x99re talking about the painting, right?\nAmy: Sure.\nScene: Rothman\xe2\x80\x99s office. Sheldon has his head stuck in the hole in the wall.\nSheldon: Help! Somebody help!\nLeonard: What happened?\nSheldon: I was trying to see what was in here and my head got stuck.\nLeonard: Why would you do that?\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s called scientific curiosity. Now go get butter.\nLeonard: Hang in there. I\xe2\x80\x99ll be right back. (Takes out phone and takes a photo. Sits down and starts posting it online.)\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
