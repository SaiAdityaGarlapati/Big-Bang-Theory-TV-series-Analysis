b'Following a \xe2\x80\x9cPreviously on The Big Bang Theory\xe2\x80\x9d section\nScene: The Comic Book Store.\nStuart: So, Howard\xe2\x80\x99s really in space, huh?\nLeonard: Mm-hmm, International Space Station. 250 miles that way.\nRaj: Right now, Howard\xe2\x80\x99s staring down at our planet like a tiny Jewish Greek god. Zeusowitz.\nSheldon: I must admit, I can\xe2\x80\x99t help but feel a twinge of envy. He can look out the window and see the majesty of the universe unfolding before his eyes. His dim, uncomprehending eyes. It\xe2\x80\x99s like a cat in an airport carrying case.\nLeonard: You know, it\xe2\x80\x99s not exactly glamorous up there. The water that the astronauts drink is made from each other\xe2\x80\x99s recycled urine.\nStuart: Must be nice. Nobody wants anything that comes out of me.\nRaj: I wonder what he\xe2\x80\x99s doing right this very second.\nLeonard: Mm, conducting experiments in zero gravity.\nRaj: Peering through his telescope at the birth of the cosmos.\nSheldon: Whatever it is, we know his life will never be the same.\nScene: The International Space Station.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Howard. Can you hear me?\nHoward: I can hear you without the phone,\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Don\xe2\x80\x99t be snippy. I\xe2\x80\x99m just excited to talk to my baby.\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m excited to talk to you, too.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): So, what\xe2\x80\x99s this mishegas about you moving out to go live with the little Polish girl?\nHoward: How about calling her my wife?\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Wives don\xe2\x80\x99t take boys from their mothers.\nHoward: They do. That\xe2\x80\x99s why we marry them.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): I just hope I\xe2\x80\x99m not dead from a broken heart before you get back.\nHoward: Ma, please. Everyone from NASA is listening to this phone call.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Good. They should know what a horrible son you are.\nHoward: Okay, Ma, great talking to you. Gotta go. Well, space is ruined.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment. Penny is bleaching Amy\xe2\x80\x99s upper lip.\nAmy: This is so exciting. Soon, my upper lip will be the same fake blonde as my beautiful best friend.\nPenny: Hey, this is my natural hair colour. Now. So, does Sheldon have anything special planned for you tomorrow night?\nAmy: Oh, yes. According to the Relationship Agreement, on the anniversary of our first date, he must take me to a nice dinner, ask about my day and engage in casual physical contact that a disinterested onlooker might mistake for intimacy.\nPenny: That\xe2\x80\x99s hot. You kids better use protection.\nAmy: How long does this stay on?\nPenny: Just a couple of minutes. You\xe2\x80\x99ve really never done this before?\nAmy: Once in high school, but I dozed off and woke up with second-degree chemical burns on my face.\nPenny: Oh, my gosh, that\xe2\x80\x99s awful. The other kids make fun of you?\nAmy: No, I had a cover story, I told everyone it was herpes. So, how\xe2\x80\x99s everything going with you and Leonard?\nPenny: Uh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, it\xe2\x80\x99s still kind of weird. We haven\xe2\x80\x99t really recovered since he proposed to me in the middle of sex.\nAmy: Oh, boo-hoo. If Sheldon proposed to me during sex, my ovaries would grab on to him and never let go.\nScene: The university cafeteria.\nSheldon: Leonard, where do you stand on the anthropic principle?\nLeonard: Interesting question. On the one hand, I always thought\xe2\x80\xa6\nSheldon: You don\xe2\x80\x99t even know what it is, do you? The anthropic principle states that if we wish to explain why our universe exists the way it does, the answer is that it must have qualities that allow intelligent creatures to arise who are capable of asking the question. As I am doing so eloquently right now.\nLeonard: I know what the anthropic principle is.\nSheldon: Of course. I just explained it to you. Now, where do you stand on it?\nLeonard: Where do you stand on it?\nSheldon: Strongly pro.\nLeonard: Then I believe that God created the world in six days, and on the seventh he made you to annoy me.\nRaj: Hey, guys.\nLeonard: Hey.\nSheldon: Yeah, wait, Raj, where do you stand on the anthropic principle?\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99m all for it.\nSheldon: Attaboy!\nLeonard: Well, hang on. Why do you believe that he knows what it is and I don\xe2\x80\x99t?\nSheldon: Oh, Leonard. Let\xe2\x80\x99s not take a saw to the branch we\xe2\x80\x99re sitting on, shall we?\nRaj: Hey, uh, if you guys are free tonight, I heard about a spa where you soak your feet n a pool full of little fish that eat all the dead skin right off them. I don\xe2\x80\x99t need to tell you in Los Angeles, sandal season is year round.\nLeonard: Actually, I\xe2\x80\x99m hanging out with Penny.\nRaj: Oh, okay. Sounds like it\xe2\x80\x99s me and you, Sheldon. How about we sic some guppies on those puppies?\nSheldon: As I\xe2\x80\x99ve stated before on numerous occasions, the only sea creature I would even consider being eaten by is the Kraken, because the last words I would hear are \xe2\x80\x9cRelease the Kraken.\xe2\x80\x9d That never gets old. \xe2\x80\x9cRelease the Kraken!\xe2\x80\x9d Oh, chills. Besides, I\xe2\x80\x99m having dinner with Amy.\nRaj: Oh, okay. I\xe2\x80\x99ll just go home and be alone. Which is cool. I eat alone, I sleep alone, I cry alone, so, cool.\nSheldon: Darn. If you weren\xe2\x80\x99t busy, I\xe2\x80\x99d ask you to join us.\nRaj: Really? I can come? Thanks.\nLeonard: Sheldon, are you sure you want to be bringing Raj on your date night with Amy?\nSheldon: Oh, absolutely. I have a contractual obligation to provide Amy with conversation and casual physical contact, but nowhere is it specified that I can\xe2\x80\x99t outsource that to an Indian.\nScene: The International Space Station\nBernadette (on webcam): Howie? Howie?\nHoward: Hey, there\xe2\x80\x99s my beautiful bride. Can you see me?\nBernadette: I can. How are you?\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m amazing. I mean, this is even better than I dreamed. I look out the window, and it\xe2\x80\x99s all so unbelievable.\nBernadette: Good for you. I just had a seemingly endless dinner with your mom.\nHoward: Oh, yeah? That\xe2\x80\x99s nice.\nBernadette: It was. Until I found out you never told her we\xe2\x80\x99re not gonna live with her. Let\xe2\x80\x99s talk about that for a minute.\nHoward: Hey, look, this pen is floating. How crazy is that?\nBernadette: You said you told her, but you never did!\nHoward: Okay, okay, I know you\xe2\x80\x99re upset, but let me share something I\xe2\x80\x99ve learned since I got here. You realize how small your problems are when you\xe2\x80\x99re looking down on them from space. Now, come on, that\xe2\x80\x99s got to make you feel better.\nBernadette: How clear is the image of me on that screen?\nHoward: Pretty clear.\nBernadette: Do I look like I feel better?\nHoward: I mean, it\xe2\x80\x99s not, like, HD quality.\nBernadette: Listen, mister, you\xe2\x80\x99re gonna talk to your mother and you\xe2\x80\x99re gonna fix this, or that thing I said I was gonna do to you the minute you got home, you can do to yourself.\nDimitri: Like he\xe2\x80\x99s been doing since he got here.\nScene: A restaurant.\nAmy: Sheldon, this place is so romantic.\nSheldon: Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m glad you like it. Raj picked it out.\nAmy: Well, when you see him, tell him I say thank you.\nSheldon: Tell him yourself.\nRaj: Yoo-hoo! Over here!\nAmy: I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand. What\xe2\x80\x99s he doing here?\nSheldon: I invited him.\nAmy: On our date? Sheldon, that\xe2\x80\x99s not okay.\nSheldon: Yes, it is. There\xe2\x80\x99s a loophole in the Relationship Agreement.\nAmy: You found a loophole?\nRaj: Sorry I started without you. I\xe2\x80\x99m a little nervous. It\xe2\x80\x99s been a long time since I\xe2\x80\x99ve been on a date.\nAmy: I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe I bleached my moustache for this.\nRaj: You should go to my girl. She\xe2\x80\x99ll knock out those sideburns for free.\nLater.\nRaj: You know, Amy, I don\xe2\x80\x99t even think you and I have had a real conversation. Let\xe2\x80\x99s use tonight to get to know each other a little better. You start.\nAmy: Go home.\nRaj: I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand.\nAmy: Sheldon, how could you do this? It\xe2\x80\x99s our second anniversary.\nRaj: It\xe2\x80\x99s your anniversary? Oh, my God, I had no idea. Amy, please, let me make this right.\nAmy: Thank you.\nRaj: My pleasure. Waiter? A bottle of champagne and three glasses. Oh, boy, isn\xe2\x80\x99t this romantic?\nSheldon: Oh, I hope that\xe2\x80\x99s a rhetorical question, because I have no clue.\nScene: The apartment.\nPenny: This is great. What\xe2\x80\x99s the occasion?\nLeonard: No occasion. You know, things have been a little weird between us, so I wanted to throw together a fun night just for you.\nPenny: That is so sweet.\nLeonard: I got all your favourites. Beer, wings, sliders. We can watch the football game. I even painted my stomach.\nPenny: Go Sports?\nLeonard: Well, in case you were in the mood for baseball, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to look ridiculous.\nPenny: This is awesome. I love it!\nLeonard: Good, I\xe2\x80\x99m glad.\nPenny: Gosh, I worked my ass off today. This is exactly what I needed.\nLeonard: Great. Just relax and enjoy. Tonight is all about you.\nPenny: Ah, thank you!\nLeonard: So, where exactly are we in this relationship?\nPenny: Oh, come on. I just told you I had a hard day.\nLeonard: You\xe2\x80\x99re right, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. Let\xe2\x80\x99s watch the game.\nPenny: Great.\nLeonard: I just know the longer we wait to talk about it, the weirder it gets.\nPenny: Sweetie, can I just be the girl tonight?\nLeonard: Absolutely. You\xe2\x80\x99re the girl, I\xe2\x80\x99m the guy. Now, you watch your football game while I make you a little plate here.\nPenny: Thank you. (Knock on door)\nLeonard: Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99ll get it. Go sports.\nRaj: Hello-lo-lo.\nLeonard: What are you doing here? I thought you were out with Sheldon and Amy.\nRaj: I was, but it\xe2\x80\x99s their anniversary and I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to be a third wheel, so I figured I\xe2\x80\x99d come over here and hang out with you and Penny on your date.\nLeonard: Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s not really a great time. Penny and I have some things we need to talk about.\nPenny: No, we don\xe2\x80\x99t! Come on in!\nRaj: Sweet!\nLeonard: I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe I shaved my stomach for this.\nScene: The International Space Station\nDimitri: Hey, Froot Loops. You got a phone call.\nHoward: Who is it?\nDimitri: A woman who says she\xe2\x80\x99s your mother but sounds like your father.\nHoward: Hey, Ma. You know, we could see each other if you turn on the computer.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): I\xe2\x80\x99m not going near that fakakta thing. I\xe2\x80\x99ll catch a computer virus.\nHoward: You can\xe2\x80\x99t catch a computer virus.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Oh, so now you\xe2\x80\x99re an astronaut and a doctor?\nHoward: What do you want, Ma?\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Your wife says you have something important to tell me.\nHoward: Okay, here it is. Bernadette and I are starting a life together and\xe2\x80\xa6\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Oh, God! You are gonna leave me.\nHoward: Ma\xe2\x80\xa6\nMrs Wolowitz (off): It\xe2\x80\x99s okay. Your father left me, you left me, I guess I\xe2\x80\x99m just the kind of person people like to leave.\nHoward: It\xe2\x80\x99s not definite. I\xe2\x80\x99ll talk to Bernadette.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Don\xe2\x80\x99t bother. I\xe2\x80\x99ll just go sit in a hole in the ground so I\xe2\x80\x99m no trouble when I die.\nHoward: Stop it, Ma. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure I can get Bernie to come around.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): I knew it. I knew she was behind this. You listen to me, if you want to be a man you can\xe2\x80\x99t let a woman tell you what to do.\nHoward: Okay, okay.\nDimitri: Oy. I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe these people won the Cold War.\nHoward: Now, can we please change the subject?\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Fine. Explain why you\xe2\x80\x99ve been gone so long and I haven\xe2\x80\x99t gotten a single letter. Not even a lousy postcard.\nScene: The apartment.\nRaj: You know, I\xe2\x80\x99m growing to like American football.\nPenny: Yeah, it\xe2\x80\x99s fun, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\nRaj: Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s not the balls-to-the-wall action of badminton or cricket, but hey, what is?\nPenny: All right, who\xe2\x80\x99s ready for another beer?\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m good.\nRaj: No, thank you.\nPenny: Girls.\nRaj: Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m having the nicest time. You guys are like family to me. You know that, right?\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99s great. Get out.\nRaj: What? Why?\nLeonard: Penny and I have some issues we need to talk about.\nRaj: Oh pish on your issues. You guys are fine. Yes, you hit some bumps along the way. I mean, Penny, you\xe2\x80\x99ve always known how this man has felt about you, but you made him grovel for affection.\nPenny: Okay, hold on\xe2\x80\xa6\nRaj: Now, don\xe2\x80\x99t blame yourself. He was a groveller from way back. But the point is, the two of you got past it. And, Leonard, you go and propose to this poor girl in the middle of sex? That was some weak tea, dude.\nLeonard: Some people might say it was romantic.\nRaj: Yeah, no. But yet, here you two are, still together. And that\xe2\x80\x99s even after you and I had our crazy naked night.\nLeonard: Okay.\nPenny: That\xe2\x80\x99s enough.\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99m just saying that after everything you\xe2\x80\x99ve been through, you get to look into each other\xe2\x80\x99s eyes and say \xe2\x80\x9cI love you.\xe2\x80\x9d And that\xe2\x80\x99s beautiful.\nLeonard: Actually, to this day, she\xe2\x80\x99s never really said it.\nRaj: Oh, Penny. That\xe2\x80\x99s ridiculous. You know you love him. You, you look him in the eyes and you say it.\nPenny: Raj.\nRaj: Oh come on, you know you want to say it. Say it. Say you love him. Say it!\nScene: The hallway. Raj is ejected from the apartment.\nRaj: I really thought she would say it.\nScene: The restaurant.\nAmy: Have I ever told you you\xe2\x80\x99re like a sexy praying mantis?\nSheldon: Every time you drink alcohol.\nAmy: You know what\xe2\x80\x99s wonderful about the praying mantis? They devour their mate.\nSheldon: Your point being?\nAmy: Dessert is served.\nSheldon: I just had cobbler.\nAmy: You know what? I\xe2\x80\x99m done with this.\nSheldon: W-Where are you going?\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99m leaving.\nSheldon: You can\xe2\x80\x99t leave. I need you.\nAmy: You do?\nSheldon: Yes. You\xe2\x80\x99re my ride.\nAmy: Sheldon, you either say something meaningful and from the heart, or you and I are done.\nSheldon: All right. Please. Amy, when I look in your eyes and you\xe2\x80\x99re looking back in mine, everything feels not quite normal, because I feel stronger and weaker at the same time. I feel excited and, at the same time, terrified. The truth is, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what I feel, except I know what kind of man I want to be.\nAmy: Sheldon, that was beautiful.\nSheldon: I should hope so. That\xe2\x80\x99s from the first Spider-Man movie.\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99ll take it.\nSheldon: Good. Now, I assume we\xe2\x80\x99re splitting the cheque?\nScene: The Comic Book Store.\nRaj: Hey, Stuart.\nStuart: Oh, hey. I was actually just about to close up.\nRaj: Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave.\nStuart: No, no. It\xe2\x80\x99s okay. Hang out.\nRaj: You sure?\nStuart: Yeah, you\xe2\x80\x99re my first customer today.\nRaj: All right. Great.\nStuart: I\xe2\x80\x99m, uh, having a nightcap. You want to join me?\nRaj: What are you drinking?\nStuart: Coffee liqueur in a Chewbacca mug. I call it a sad-tini.\nRaj: Perfect for the night I\xe2\x80\x99m having. Thank you.\nStuart: Hmm. Nice not to drink alone.\nRaj: Amen to that. Sometimes I pour a little chardonnay into my dog\xe2\x80\x99s water bowl.\nStuart: You\xe2\x80\x99re kidding.\nRaj: She\xe2\x80\x99s kind of a mean drunk, but what are you gonna do?\nStuart: Cheers.\nRaj: Cheers.\nStuart: A little music?\nRaj: Sure. Mmm. Bossa nova. You listen to that with your hips as well as your ears.\nStuart: Mmm.\nRaj: Oh. Something about latin music just makes me feel like I\xe2\x80\x99m on a white sand beach in Rio.\nStuart: Yeah. The sun, the waves, the beautiful bodies, tanned and glistening with sweat.\nRaj: I should go.\nStuart: Yeah.\nRaj: Uh, thank you for the drink.\nStuart: No problem.\nRaj: Hey, Stuart.\nStuart: Yeah?\nRaj: Do you want to hang out tomorrow night, maybe grab a bite to eat or catch a late movie?\nStuart: Yeah, I-I\xe2\x80\x99d like to, but I\xe2\x80\x99m a little tight on funds.\nRaj: No problem. My treat. I\xe2\x80\x99ll swing by after work.\nStuart: Okay.\nRaj: Okay.\nStuart: I could do worse.\nScene: The International Space Station\nBernadette: Aw, that\xe2\x80\x99s such good news, Howie. Thank you for telling her.\nHoward: Hey, I\xe2\x80\x99m a grown man. I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna live with my wife. My mother\xe2\x80\x99s just gonna have to learn to make do on her own.\nBernadette: Was she upset?\nHoward: Who can tell? She yells everything. She might have been upset. She might have been hungry.\nBernadette: Thanks for fixing it. I love you.\nHoward: I love you, too. Sweet dreams. I\xe2\x80\x99ll talk to you tomorrow?\nBernadette: Good night, Rocket Man.\nHoward: To infinity and beyond, baby.\nDimitri: Loops. You realize you just lied your ass off to your wife and your mother.\nHoward: I know.\nDimitri: What are you gonna do when you get back to Earth?\nHoward: Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m never going back.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
