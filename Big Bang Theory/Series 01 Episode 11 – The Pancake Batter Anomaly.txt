b'Scene: The living room of the apartment. Leonard and Sheldon are playing the three dimensional chess game from the original Star Trek series. It is Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s move. He takes his time, moving round the board and checking things from various angles. Finally he tentatively makes a move. Sheldon moves almost immediately.\nSheldon: Checkmate.\nLeonard: O-o-o-o-h! Again?\nSheldon: Obviously you\xe2\x80\x99re not well suited for three-dimensional chess, perhaps three dimensional candyland would be more your speed.\nLeonard: Just reset the board.\nSheldon: It must be humbling to suck on so many different levels.\nPenny (knocking and entering): Hi guys.\nLeonard: Hey!\nPenny: Did you get my mail.\nLeonard: Yeah, right here. How was Nebraska?\nPenny: Oh, better than North Dakota! (Pause) I guess that joke\xe2\x80\x99s only funny in Nebraska.\nSheldon: From the data at hand you really can\xe2\x80\x99t draw that conclusion. All you can say with absolute certainty is that that joke is not funny here.\nPenny: Boy, it\xe2\x80\x99s good to be back.\nLeonard: How was your family?\nPenny: Ugh, it was the worst trip, everyone got sick over the weekend.\nSheldon: Sick?\nLeonard: Here we go.\nSheldon (running to opposite side of the room): What kind of sick?\nPenny: Oh, the flu I guess.\nSheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t need you to guess, I need you to know, now when did the symptoms first appear?\nPenny: Maybe Friday.\nSheldon: Friday, was that morning or afternoon?\nPenny: I\xe2\x80\xa6 I don\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\xa6\nSheldon: Think woman, who blew their nose and when?\nLeonard: Sheldon, relax, she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have any symptoms, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure she\xe2\x80\x99s not contagious.\nSheldon: Oh please, if influenza was only contagious after symptoms appear it would have died out thousands of years ago. Somewhere between tool using and cave painting, homo habilus would have figured out to kill the guy with the runny nose.\nLeonard: Penny, you\xe2\x80\x99ll have to excuse Sheldon, he\xe2\x80\x99s a bit of a germophobe.\nPenny: Oh, it\xe2\x80\x99s okay, I understand.\nSheldon: Thanks for your consideration, now please leave.\nLeonard: You\xe2\x80\x99d better go before he starts spraying you with Lysol.\nPenny: Okay, well, thank you for getting my mail.\nLeonard: No problem. Welcome home. (Sees Penny out. Turns to find Sheldon spraying the air with Lysol.)\nSheldon: What?\nCredits sequence\nScene: The kitchen\nLeonard: What the hell are you doing?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m making petrie dishes to grow throat cultures.\nLeonard: With lime jello?\nSheldon: I need a growth medium, and someone polished off the apricot yoghurt. Here, swab my throat.\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t think so.\nSheldon: Leonard! If I\xe2\x80\x99m going to get ahead of this thing I need to find out what\xe2\x80\x99s growing in my throat.\nLeonard: Sheldon, you are not sick. This is, but you are not.\nSheldon: We have no idea what pathogen Typhoid Penny has introduced into our environment. And having never been to Nebraska I\xe2\x80\x99m fairly certain that I have no cornhusking antibodies.\nLeonard: Sheldon, don\xe2\x80\x99t you think you\xe2\x80\x99re overreacting?\nSheldon: When I\xe2\x80\x99m lying comatose in a hospital relying on inferior minds to cure me, these jello cultures and my accompanying notes will give them a fighting chance.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m going back to bed.\nSheldon: Wait. (Handing him a measuring jug) Put this in the bathroom.\nLeonard: What for?\nSheldon: I need to measure my fluid intake and output to make sure my kidneys aren\xe2\x80\x99t shutting down.\nLeonard: I mix pancake batter in this!\nSheldon: No, that measuring cup has always been for urine.\nLeonard: You had time to make a label for everything in this apartment, including the label maker, but you didn\xe2\x80\x99t have ten seconds to make one that said urine cup?\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s right here on the bottom.\nLeonard: Huh. I guess I owe the Betty Crocker company a letter of apology.\nScene: Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom. Sheldon wakes up and coughs. Picks up an electronic thermometer and takes his temperature.\nSheldon: Oh, dear God. (Shouting) Leonard! Leonard, I\xe2\x80\x99m sick!\nCut to Leonard entering living room in panic, stumbling and trying to put on a pair of trousers.\nSheldon (voice off): Leonard! Leonard I\xe2\x80\x99m sick!\nLeonard grabs jacket and leaves through front door.\nSheldon (entering, wrapped in duvet): Leonard! Leonard! Leonard. Leonard, my comforter fell down, and my sinuses hurt when I bend over. Leonard? (Bends to get phone) Ow!\nLeonard (voice on phone): Hey.\nSheldon: Leonard, where are you?\nLeonard (running down stairs): I\xe2\x80\x99m at work.\nSheldon: At six-thirty in the morning?\nLeonard: Yes.\nSheldon: On Sunday?\nLeonard: Yes.\nSheldon: Why?\nLeonard: They asked me to come in.\nSheldon: Well, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t hear the phone ring.\nLeonard: They texted me.\nSheldon: Well, as I predicted, I am sick. My fever has been tracking up exponentially since 2am, and I am producing sputum at an alarming rate.\nLeonard: No kidding?\nSheldon: No. Not only that, it has shifted from clear to milky green.\nLeonard: Alright, well, get some rest and drink plenty of fluids.\nSheldon: What else would I drink? Gasses? Solids? Ionised plasma?\nLeonard: Drink whatever you want.\nSheldon: I want soup.\nLeonard: Then make soup.\nSheldon: We don\xe2\x80\x99t have soup.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m at work, Sheldon. (A woman enters the apartment building with a barking dog.)\nSheldon: Is that a dog?\nLeonard: Yes,\nSheldon: In the lab?\nLeonard: Yes, they\xe2\x80\x99re training dogs to operate the centrifuge for when they need dogs to operate the centrifuge for blind scientists, I have to go.\nScene: Howard\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom. The phone is ringing.\nHoward\xe2\x80\x99s Mother (voice): Howard, it\xe2\x80\x99s the phone.\nHoward: I know it\xe2\x80\x99s the phone, Ma, I hear the phone.\nHoward\xe2\x80\x99s Mother: Well who\xe2\x80\x99s calling at this ungodly hour?\nHoward: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\nHoward\xe2\x80\x99s Mother: Well ask them why they\xe2\x80\x99re calling at this ungodly hour.\nHoward: How can I ask them when I\xe2\x80\x99m talking to you! (Into phone) Hello.\nLeonard: Howard, it\xe2\x80\x99s Leonard, code Milky Green.\nHoward: Dear Lord, not Milky Green!\nLeonard: Affirmative, with fever.\nHoward\xe2\x80\x99s Mother: Who\xe2\x80\x99s on the phone.\nHoward: It\xe2\x80\x99s Leonard.\nHoward\xe2\x80\x99s Mother: Why is he calling.\nHoward: Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s sick.\nHoward\xe2\x80\x99s Mother: Were you playing with him?\nHoward: For God\xe2\x80\x99s sake, Ma, I\xe2\x80\x99m twenty six years old.\nHoward\xe2\x80\x99s Mother: Excuse me Mr Grown-up. Whadda-ya want for breakfast.\nHoward: Chocolate milk and eggoes please!\nLeonard: Howard, listen to me.\nHoward: Hang on, call waiting.\nLeonard (voice): No, don\xe2\x80\x99t, don\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\xa6.\nHoward: Hello.\nSheldon: Howard, I\xe2\x80\x99m sick.\nHoward (imitating his mother\xe2\x80\x99s voice): Howard\xe2\x80\x99s sleeping, this is his mother. Why are you calling at this ungodly hour?\nSheldon: I need soup.\nHoward: Then call your own mother. (To Leonard) It was Sheldon.\nLeonard: I tried to stop you.\nHoward: It\xe2\x80\x99s my own fault, I forgot the protocol we put in place after the great ear infection of \xe2\x80\x9906.\nLeonard: You call Koothrappali, we need to find a place to lay low for the next eighteen to twenty four hours.\nHoward: Stand by. Ma, can my friends come over?\nHoward\xe2\x80\x99s Mother: I just had the carpets steamed.\nHoward: That\xe2\x80\x99s a negatory. But there\xe2\x80\x99s a Planet of the Apes marathon at the New Art today.\nLeonard: Five movies, two hours apiece. It\xe2\x80\x99s a start.\nScene: The Cheesecake Factory.\nWaitress: Homeless crazy guy at table eighteen.\nPenny: No, just crazy. Sheldon, what are you doing here?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m sick, thank you very much.\nPenny: How could you have gotten it from me, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sick.\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re a carrier. All these people here are doomed. You\xe2\x80\x99re doomed!\nPenny: Shhh! Sheldon, what do you want.\nSheldon: I want soup.\nPenny (over Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s strange throat clearance): Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you just\xe2\x80\xa6. (louder throat clearance) Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you just have soup at home.\nSheldon: Penny, I have an IQ of 187, don\xe2\x80\x99t you imagine that if there were a way for me to have had soup at home I would have thought of it?\nPenny: You can have soup delivered.\nSheldon: I did not think of that. Clearly febrile delirium is setting in, please bring me some soup while I still understand what a spoon is for.\nPenny: Okay, what kind of soup do you want.\nSheldon: Well, my mother used to make me this split pea with little frankfurter slices and these home made croutons.\nPenny: We have Chicken Tortilla and Potato Leek.\nSheldon: Can I get any of those with little frankfurter slices and home made croutons?\nPenny: No.\nSheldon: Then surprise me. (Blows nose into handkerchief. Shows it to next table) Would you call that moss green or forest green?\nScene: The cinema. Everyone is wearing ape masks.\nHoward: Look at this, everyone went chimp.\nRaj: Well I\xe2\x80\x99d like to point out, I voted for orang-utan, but you shouted me down. (Phone rings).\nLeonard: Oh, hi Penny!\nPenny: Hey, where are you?\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\xa6 uh\xe2\x80\xa6 at work.\nPenny: You sound funny.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\xa6 uh\xe2\x80\xa6 in a\xe2\x80\xa6 I\xe2\x80\x99m in a radiation suit. What\xe2\x80\x99s up?\nPenny: Yeah, well I\xe2\x80\x99m at work too, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll never guess who\xe2\x80\x99s here infecting my entire station.\nLeonard (To Howard and Raj): Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s at the Cheesecake Factory. (Into phone) Just tell him to go home.\nPenny: He won\xe2\x80\x99t leave, he says he\xe2\x80\x99s afraid he\xe2\x80\x99ll pass out on the bus and someone will harvest his organs.\nLeonard (To Howard and Raj): He\xe2\x80\x99s paranoid, and he\xe2\x80\x99s established a nest.\nPenny: Can you please come get him?\nLeonard: Uh, yeah, I\xe2\x80\x99d be\xe2\x80\xa6 I\xe2\x80\x99d be happy to Penny. (Holds phone up, Howard makes warning siren noises) Oh my God there\xe2\x80\x99s a breech in the radiation unit (Raj joins in) The whole city is in jeopardy, oh my God, Professor Googenfeil is melting, gotta go, bye! (To Howard and Raj) I feel really guilty.\nRaj: You did what you had to do. (Steals some of Howard\xe2\x80\x99s popcorn)\nHoward: Take your stinking paws off my popcorn you damn dirty ape.\nScene: The stairwell.\nSheldon: Thanks for bringing me home.\nPenny: Oh, it\xe2\x80\x99s okay, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t really need to work today, it\xe2\x80\x99s not like I have rent or car payments or anything.\nSheldon: Good. Good.\nPenny: Okay, well, you feel better.\nSheldon: Wait, where are you going?\nPenny: Um, home, to write some bad cheques.\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re going to leave me?\nPenny: Sheldon, you are a grown man, haven\xe2\x80\x99t you ever been sick before?\nSheldon: Well, of course, but, not by myself.\nPenny: Really, never?\nSheldon: Well, once. When I was fifteen, and spending the summer at the Heidelberg Institute in Germany.\nPenny: Studying abroad?\nSheldon: No, visiting professor. Anyway, the local cuisine was a little more sausage-based than I\xe2\x80\x99m used to, and the result was an internal blitzkrieg with my lower intestine playing the part of Czechoslovakia.\nPenny: And there was no-one there to take care of you?\nSheldon: No. No, my mum had to fly back to Texas to help my dad because the house had slipped off the cinderblocks again.\nPenny: Again?\nSheldon: It was tornado season. And it was an aluminium house. Anyway, the housekeeper in the faculty residence didn\xe2\x80\x99t speak any English, when I finally managed to convince her I was sick, she said \xe2\x80\x9cM\xc3\xb6chtest Du eine Darmsp\xc3\xbclung?\xe2\x80\x9d\nPenny: What does that mean?\nSheldon: Based on what happened next, I assume it means \xe2\x80\x9cwould you like an enema?\xe2\x80\x9d\nPenny: Okay, sweetie, I\xe2\x80\x99ll take care of you, what do you need?\nSheldon: Well, my mom used to give me sponge baths.\nPenny: Okay, ground rules, no sponge baths, and definitely no enemas.\nSheldon: Agreed.\nScene: The cinema.\nRaj: Here we go, ten and a half hours of apey goodness.\nLeonard: Oh dammit, my glasses. Okay, I\xe2\x80\x99m blind here guys, can you help me find them?\nHoward: Sorry. (Crunching sound) Found \xe2\x80\x98em.\nLeonard: Oh great.\nHoward: Sorry, don\xe2\x80\x99t you have a spare.\nLeonard: Yeah, at home.\nRaj: Well if you leave now, you can be back before the gorillas rip the crap out of Charlton Heston.\nHoward: Unless Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s there, in which case you\xe2\x80\x99ll be trapped forever in his whiny hyper neurotic snot-web.\nLeonard (Dials phone): Hi, Penny. I was wondering, is Sheldon still at the restaurant? Okay, that was very nice of you. Okay, gotta go, got kind of a full blown Chernobyl thing here, gotta go, bye. (To Howard) He\xe2\x80\x99s home, I\xe2\x80\x99m screwed. Ten and a half hours of apey blurriness.\nRaj: How about Lasic?\nLeonard: You want me to get eye surgery?\nRaj: Would you rather go back to the apartment and deal with Sheldon, or have a stranger carve out your corneas with a laser beam?\nHoward: Well?\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking!\nScene: Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom.\nPenny: Okay, nice and cosy, okay, I\xe2\x80\x99ll see you later.\nSheldon: Wait. Will you please rub this on my chest.\nPenny: Oh, Sheldon, can\xe2\x80\x99t you do that yourself?\nSheldon: Vaporub makes my hands smell funny.\nPenny: But Sheldon\xe2\x80\xa6.\nSheldon: Please, please, please, please, please, please, please.\nPenny: I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe I\xe2\x80\x99m doing this.\nSheldon: No, no, counter-clockwise or my chest hair mats.\nPenny: Sorry.\nSheldon: Can you sing \xe2\x80\x9cSoft Kitty\xe2\x80\x9d.\nPenny: What?\nSheldon: My mom used to sing it to me when I was sick.\nPenny: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, honey, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know it.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99ll teach you. \xe2\x80\x9cSoft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur, happy kitty, sleepy kitty, purr purr purr.\xe2\x80\x9d Now you.\nPenny (after a loud sigh): Soft kitty, warm kitty\xe2\x80\xa6\nSheldon: Little ball of fur. Keep rubbing.\nPenny (through gritted teeth): Little ball of fur.\nScene: The living room door, a fibre-optic camera emerges from underneath. We see the scene from its point of view. Cut to outside. Raj is holding a laptop, Howard is feeding the camera under the door.\nLeonard: What do you see, what do you see.\nRaj: The living room appears to be empty.\nLeonard: Okay, he must be in his bedroom. My spare glasses are in my bedroom, on my dresser, next to my Bat-signal.\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m not going in there.\nLeonard: Raj?\nRaj: No way, Jose.\nLeonard: Well I can\xe2\x80\x99t do it, I can\xe2\x80\x99t see anything.\nHoward: It\xe2\x80\x99s all right, wireless mini-cam and Bluetooth headset. We\xe2\x80\x99ll be your eyes.\nLeonard: Fine.\nHoward: One more thing. This is a subsonic impact sensor. If Sheldon gets out of bed and starts to walk, this device will register it and send a signal to the laptop. At that point, based on the geography of the apartment and the ambulatory speed of a sick Sheldon, you\xe2\x80\x99ll have seven seconds to get out, glasses or no glasses.\nLeonard: Won\xe2\x80\x99t my footsteps set it off?\nHoward: No, you\xe2\x80\x99ll be on your hands and knees. Now you\xe2\x80\x99ll need to get the sensor as close as you can to Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s room.\nLeonard: Well, how do I carry it if I\xe2\x80\x99m on my hands and knees?\nCut to Leonard entering apartment on hands and knees, carrying the sensor in his teeth.\nHoward: Stay low. Bear left. Now keep true.\nLeonard: What?\nHoward: It means go straight.\nLeonard: Then just say go straight.\nHoward: You don\xe2\x80\x99t stay go straight when you\xe2\x80\x99re giving bearings, you say keep true.\nLeonard: Alright (Bangs head on a trunk.) I just hit my head.\nHoward: Because you didn\xe2\x80\x99t keep true. (Time shift, Leonard is now outside bedrooms) Okay, turn right.\nRaj: The\xe2\x80\xa6 the picture\xe2\x80\x99s breaking up.\nHoward: Angle your head to the right. A little more. A little more. (Leonard now has his head at right angles to his body) That\xe2\x80\x99s it, now just keep true. Alright, you\xe2\x80\x99re close enough to Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s room, deploy the sensor. Now turn it on.\nLeonard: It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t on?\nHoward: No.\nLeonard: Then why did I have to crawl?\nHoward: Oh, I guess you didn\xe2\x80\x99t.\nLeonard: Okay, it\xe2\x80\x99s on.\nHoward: Good. From this point forward you will have to crawl.\nLeonard: I know.\nHoward: Hang on, the sensor\xe2\x80\x99s picking up something, turn your head back. (Camera angle shows a pair of female legs.)\nPenny: You rat bastard.\nHoward (running down stairs with Raj): Told you the sensor would work.\nLeonard: Hi!\nPenny: You deliberately stuck me with Sheldon.\nLeonard: Well, I had to, you see what he\xe2\x80\x99s like.\nSheldon (off): Penny! Penny, I\xe2\x80\x99m hungry.\nPenny: Uh, it\xe2\x80\x99s okay, sweetie, good news, Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s home!\nLeonard: No!\nPenny (handing him vaporub): Here you go, good luck, bye.\nLeonard: W-wait!\nSheldon: Leonard, I\xe2\x80\x99m hungry!\nLeonard: Wait! Penny! Take me with you! (Runs after her and bumps into pillar. Falls semi-conscious to the floor.  Sheldon appears in his comforter.)\nSheldon: I want grilled cheese.\nTime shift. Sheldon and Leonard are on the sofa. Sheldon is wrapped in his comforter, Leonard is holding an ice-pack to his head.\nSheldon: Do you think Penny will come here and take care of us?\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t think Penny\xe2\x80\x99s ever coming here again.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m very congested.\nLeonard: Yeah, so?\nSheldon: Can you go to the kitchen, and get me the turkey baster labelled mucus.\nLeonard: If I stand, I\xe2\x80\x99ll vomit.\nSheldon: Under the sink, yellow Tupperware bowl.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAdvertisements\nREPORT THIS AD\nREPORT THIS AD'
