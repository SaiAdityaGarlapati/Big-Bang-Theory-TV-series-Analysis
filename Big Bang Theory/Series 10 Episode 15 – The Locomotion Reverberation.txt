b'Scene: The laboratory.\nHoward: Okay, I\xe2\x80\x99m zeroing out the electro-osmotic flow rate in the micro-fluidic channel.\nLeonard: Nicely done, Howard.\nHoward: Well, my wife is four-foot-ten and sexually satisfied, so clearly I know my way around tiny things.\nLeonard: Good for you, on the cutting edge of new technology and still making inappropriate comments about the mother of your child.\nHoward: Those are just the things I say out loud.\nSheldon: Gentlemen, we need to stop immediately.\nHoward: What\xe2\x80\x99s wrong?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m looking at the math, and I think we can make the device between eight and ten percent smaller.\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99s great, but the Air Force approved the specs. We\xe2\x80\x99re good to go.\nHoward: Yeah. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t need to be smaller.\nSheldon: Shame on you. Where would we be if poodle breeders had that attitude? I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you. We would have the standard and the miniature poodle, but no toy or teacup. Which by the way, is not an officially recognized breed, but that\xe2\x80\x99s just poodle politics.\nLeonard: Can we please stop talking about poodles?\nSheldon: Fine. Candy bars. Now, do you enjoy a fun size? I know you do.\nHoward: Sheldon, we don\xe2\x80\x99t need to make this smaller, and your work is done. Go home.\nSheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to go home.\nLeonard: Fine, go for a little walk.\nSheldon: Then what?\nLeonard: Just keep walking.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The laboratory.\nLeonard: At least it\xe2\x80\x99s quiet when he takes bathroom breaks.\nHoward: I know. That\xe2\x80\x99s why I keep refilling his water when he\xe2\x80\x99s not looking.\nLeonard: You\xe2\x80\x99re kidding.\nHoward: I don\xe2\x80\x99t care if we\xe2\x80\x99re in a drought, it\xe2\x80\x99s worth it.\nLeonard: You know, I do have a way to get him out of our hair. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been holding onto this for a few years, but maybe now\xe2\x80\x99s the time.\nHoward: We can just lock the door, you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to kill him.\nLeonard: You can\xe2\x80\x99t kill him, he\xe2\x80\x99ll just respawn at the last save point.\nSheldon: Oh, that was my sixth trip to the bathroom. As long as that\xe2\x80\x99s not a urinary tract infection, that\xe2\x80\x99s a personal best.\nLeonard: Hey, uh, buddy, I got you a little present.\nSheldon: Really?\nLeonard: Yeah. Go ahead, open it.\nSheldon: Congratulations. The bearer of this certificate is entitled to the ultimate train experience at The Nevada Northern Railway. You are at the throttle. You are the engineer. You are running the locomotive. This doesn\xe2\x80\x99t happen very often, but here comes a hug. Oh, dear, I have to tinkle again.\nLeonard: Okay. Where were we?\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s kitchen.\nBernadette: For Howie\xe2\x80\x99s occupation, should I include that he was an astronaut?\nAmy: Well, he mentioned it in his mother\xe2\x80\x99s eulogy, so why not?\nPenny: I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe you have to fill out a preschool application for an infant.\nRaj: Uh, the one at Caltech has a crazy wait list. I warned you, a lot of people apply when they\xe2\x80\x99re still pregnant.\nBernadette: Well, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t. I also skipped a birthing class to see Zootopia so back off.\nRaj: Whoa. Just trying to help.\nBernadette: Sorry. Howie\xe2\x80\x99s back at work and there\xe2\x80\x99s just so much going on.\nAmy: Is there anything we can do?\nBernadette: Sure. Open up a college fund, shop for life insurance, and in the laundry room, there\xe2\x80\x99s a mountain of dirty laundry. Wash it or burn in, your choice. Ugh, be right back.\nRaj: No, no. I will take care of it.\nBernadette: Oh, thank you.\nRaj: While I\xe2\x80\x99m gone, you can think about how mean you were to me.\nPenny: All right, you know what you need? A night away from all of this. You know, where you can just kind of relax and, I\xe2\x80\x99m just gonna turn this off. Much better. Seriously, let\xe2\x80\x99s plan a night, you know, give you a break. We could go dancing.\nBernadette: That sounds really nice.\nAmy: Oh. All this week, the Early Music Society of Pasadena is doing a joint concert with the San Gabriel Renaissance Choir.\nPenny: Okay, that\xe2\x80\x99s the one to beat.\nAmy: Good luck. People have been saying that for 600 years.\nScene: Sheldon and Amy\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nAmy: Hey, you\xe2\x80\x99re home early.\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99ll never believe it. Leonard gave me the most incredible gift, a trip to a historic railway, and I get to operate an actual locomotive.\nAmy: Wow. He finally used it. What\xe2\x80\x99d you do?\nSheldon: No idea. All I know is I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna be working on the railroad all the livelong day.\nAmy: Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m really happy for you.\nSheldon: Oh, no. It\xe2\x80\x99s not just me. No. The railway is four hours from the nearest airport, and guess who gets to drive me.\nAmy: I give up.\nSheldon: You.\nAmy: No. I really give up.\nSheldon: Oh, oh. And guess where we get to sleep? Our choice of a turn-of-the-century railway bunkhouse or a working caboose. Now, the problem with a caboose is there\xe2\x80\x99s no bathroom, but the problem with the bunkhouse is it\xe2\x80\x99s not a caboose. On the first day, I get to drive a steam engine. Oh, and the second day, a diesel engine. Oh, and if I volunteer to do track maintenance and paperwork, they\xe2\x80\x99ll let me stay as long as I want. So you might want to pack enough clothes for the rest of our lives.\nAmy: Can I pee now?\nSheldon: Oh, get this. I get to take a test based on a 125-page manual. I get to learn things like hand signals. Ooh. There\xe2\x80\x99s forward, uh, reverse, set the brakes. Are you done yet? You\xe2\x80\x99re missing\nsome great stuff out here. Oh, this is good. There are dozens of railroad crossings you have to blow the whistle for. But that is the figurative you, not the literal you. I\xe2\x80\x99ll be blowing the whistle. Amy, get up. It\xe2\x80\x99s time to go to work.\nScene: The laboratory.\nLeonard: This train thing worked out better than I thought. He\xe2\x80\x99s home studying the engineer\xe2\x80\x99s manual.\nHoward: It\xe2\x80\x99s so peaceful without him here. Can I ask you how much that cost?\nLeonard: Four thousand dollars, worth every penny.\nCol Williams: Gentlemen.\nLeonard: Colonel Williams. Sir.\nCol Williams: Just wanted to see how the guidance system\xe2\x80\x99s coming along.\nHoward: Great. We found a cooling solution that allowed us to get the size of the prototype down to the target specs.\nLeonard: As a cooling solution, it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty cool.\nCol Williams: Don\xe2\x80\x99t do that. What\xe2\x80\x99s this?\nLeonard: Oh, nothing. Just some math we don\xe2\x80\x99t need.\nCol Williams: This is a different approach. Are you trying to get the guidance system even smaller?\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s just a theory. Uh, it\xe2\x80\x99s not even worked out.\nCol Williams: Oh. I want this.\nHoward: But we\xe2\x80\x99ve already met the agreed upon specs. Going smaller would require weeks\xe2\x80\x99 worth of new computations.\nCol Williams: So get the kid with the two shirts to do it.\nLeonard: Sir, uh, if I may, uh, we\xe2\x80\x99ve put a lot of thought and effort into this current prototype. It\xe2\x80\x99s a really elegant solution, and most importantly, it works.\nCol Williams: Yeah, I want this.\nHoward: Okay, but that\xe2\x80\x99s just a theory. It\xe2\x80\x99s not even a complete thought.\nCol Williams: You both make excellent points, and thank you for presenting it so articulately. Make this.\nHoward: The kid with the two shirts screwed us again.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s house.\nPenny: All right. You guys ready to get crazy?\nAmy: Well, the bra under here ain\xe2\x80\x99t beige.\nRaj: Okay. You ladies have fun tonight.\nStuart: Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry about Halley. Uncle Stuart\xe2\x80\x99s on the job.\nRaj: Under the careful supervision of her godfather.\nStuart: My apologies. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to offend you, Don Corleone.\nRaj: Like I said, you ladies have fun.\nBernadette: We will. Got my dancing shoes, got my breast pump. Let\xe2\x80\x99s party.\nPenny: You know, if you pump at the bar, I promise we\xe2\x80\x99ll get free drinks.\nBernadette: Call if there\xe2\x80\x99s any problems.\nPenny: No. She\xe2\x80\x99s busy. You call Howard.\nRaj: Got it.\nBernadette: Call me. Don\xe2\x80\x99t call Howard.\nRaj: I would never call Howard.\nStuart: Okay, instead of arguing all night, let\xe2\x80\x99s just split up the baby chores.\nRaj: Yeah, great. Um, I\xe2\x80\x99ll put food in her top half, you deal with whatever comes out the bottom.\nScene: The stairwell.\nHoward: I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe we have to ask Sheldon to come back and help us.\nLeonard: Oh, boo-hoo. I spent four grand on a gift that only got rid of him for an afternoon. What is that?\nHoward: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, but if he yells It\xe2\x80\x99s alive, we run.\nSheldon: Oh, hey. If you knocked, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t hear you. I\xe2\x80\x99m welding this locomotive engine. And if you didn\xe2\x80\x99t knock, how about some manners?\nHoward: How\xe2\x80\x99d you even get that up the stairs?\nSheldon: I said to myself, I think I can, I think I can. And then I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t, so I paid two men who promised not to come rob us later.\nLeonard: Okay, look, Sheldon, the Colonel wants us to make the guidance system smaller, and we can\xe2\x80\x99t do it without you.\nSheldon: Interesting. Well, so I was right.\nHoward: Open a window. It\xe2\x80\x99s about to get smug in here.\nSheldon: Well, I would love to help you, but since I discovered the satisfaction of working with my hands on a train engine, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I can go back to theory. I\xe2\x80\x99m an engineer now. And, hey, just to be clear, a train engineer. Not that goofy kind you are.\nLeonard: Sheldon, you can still go on the trip in a few weeks. Just help us out.\nSheldon: Sorry. I need to work on this engine so when I get to the train yard I won\xe2\x80\x99t look foolish.\nHoward: He\xe2\x80\x99s worried about looking foolish. That\xe2\x80\x99s a heapin\xe2\x80\x99 helping of irony right there.\nLeonard: Come on, you know you\xe2\x80\x99re not leaving physics. Why are you doing this?\nSheldon: Leonard, in the world of theoretical physics, you never finish. So much is unprovable. But when I was studying that railway guide, it was so tangible and so satisfying that something just clicked. Then it clacked. Then it clicked, then it clacked, click-clack clickety-clack, and here we are. Whoo-whoo.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s car.\nAmy: Hey, did you hear anything back from the Caltech preschool?\nBernadette: Not yet, but we\xe2\x80\x99re gonna apply to a bunch of others just to keep our options open.\nPenny: Okay, stop that. No more preschool talk. Tonight is about having fun.\nAmy: Nothing says fun like being scolded.\nBernadette (phone rings): Oh, it\xe2\x80\x99s Raj. Everything okay?\nRaj: Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry. Everything\xe2\x80\x99s fine.\nStuart: Hang up, we don\xe2\x80\x99t need help.\nRaj: I don\xe2\x80\x99t need your help deciding when we need help!\nBernadette: Raj, what\xe2\x80\x99s going on?\nRaj: Yes, so, I was just warming up some milk for Halley, and I thought it smelled a little funky, so I checked the date that you wrote on the bottle, and it says Flerbsday.\nStuart: It says Tuesday.\nRaj: How is that a T?\nBernadette: I\xe2\x80\x99m sure it\xe2\x80\x99s fine, but if you\xe2\x80\x99re worried, there\xe2\x80\x99s extra milk in the freezer.\nRaj: Okay, yes, I will err on the side of caution and defrost a fresh batch.\nStuart: You\xe2\x80\x99re wasting perfectly good milk.\nRaj: Fine, you drink it.\nStuart: It\xe2\x80\x99s just milk.\nBernadette: Stuart, don\xe2\x80\x99t you drink my milk.\nPenny: Okay, give. Can you guys handle this or not?\nRaj: Oh, of course we can. Uh, you girls have a good time. She said I was in charge.\nStuart: Hmm. So we just throw this away?\nRaj: What else are you gonna do with it? Put it in your coffee?\nStuart: Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t take it black.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: Okay. This is everything he had on the board. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure we can figure the rest out.\nHoward: All right. Hmm. Feel free to jump in. Hmm is all I got.\nLeonard: Oh, we can get this. Is there any chance it\xe2\x80\x99s upside-down?\nHoward: Maybe we can find another theoretical physicist to help us.\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s classified. If we tell anyone, we\xe2\x80\x99d get in trouble.\nHoward: Hey, I came up with that and hmm. You haven\xe2\x80\x99t pitched anything.\nLeonard: Just keep thinking. I got it.\nHoward: You really figured it out?\nLeonard: No, but when we show this nonsense to Sheldon, it will make him crazy, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll have to fix it.\nHoward: Oh, you\xe2\x80\x99re a genius.\nLeonard: Yeah, I know. That\xe2\x80\x99s not even a math symbol. That\xe2\x80\x99s just Charlie Brown\xe2\x80\x99s hair.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s car\nPenny: Sorry, guys. This club was so great, how could they turn it into a bookstore? I thought we got rid of all those.\nAmy: Renaissance Choir\xe2\x80\x99s looking pretty good right now, huh?\nBernadette (on phone): Hello?\nRaj: Nothing to worry about. She\xe2\x80\x99s just been crying for a little while, and I was wondering if you had any tricks to get her to sleep.\nStuart: She was sleeping just fine till you took a selfie with her.\nRaj: She was blowing a spit bubble. It was adorable.\nBernadette: You guys got this? Do you need me to come home?\nStuart: Wait. She\xe2\x80\x99s settling down.\nRaj: Oh, okay, false alarm. Little parenting tip, sleeping babies hate flash photography.\nPenny: Is everything okay?\nBernadette: Yeah. I may have just left my infant daughter with Patrick and SpongeBob.\nAmy: Hey, there\xe2\x80\x99s another dance club nearby. I mean, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how you feel about Latin music, but according to their horas of operaci\xc3\xb3n, they\xe2\x80\x99re open.\nPenny: Maybe we should just call it a night.\nAmy: You sure? They\xe2\x80\x99re open till dos.\nBernadette: Yeah, we\xe2\x80\x99re all dressed up. Why go home?\nPenny: I\xe2\x80\x99m just not really in the mood anymore.\nBernadette: What\xe2\x80\x99s going on with you?\nPenny: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. This is all starting to feel like a sad attempt to recapture our youth.\nBernadette: I\xe2\x80\x99m not sad. I just wanted to get drunk and not wear sweatpants.\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99m not sad. I mean, hello.\nPenny: Okay, maybe I\xe2\x80\x99m the one who\xe2\x80\x99s sad.\nAmy: What are you sad about?\nPenny: Maybe the fact that you went and had a baby.\nBernadette: You\xe2\x80\x99re upset I had a baby?\nPenny: No, of course not. I just, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t think it would make me have all these feelings.\nAmy: What feelings?\nPenny: Pressure. I mean, she\xe2\x80\x99s looking at preschools, she has a minivan, she has a 401K. Before she talked about it, I just thought that was a race.\nBernadette: You think that stuff is fun? Being a parent is terrifying. I\xe2\x80\x99m constantly worried, I\xe2\x80\x99m always tired, and in a few minutes I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna milk myself in a bookstore parking lot.\nPenny: I get that, okay? It\xe2\x80\x99s just, Leonard and I have been married for two years, and we\xe2\x80\x99re no further along than when we were dating.\nAmy: Come on. You\xe2\x80\x99ve got so much to feel good about. You\xe2\x80\x99ve got a great job now.\nPenny: Yeah, I guess I am making decent money.\nAmy: You make more than I do.\nBernadette: You may not have a house yet, but your apartment\xe2\x80\x99s great.\nAmy: It\xe2\x80\x99s bigger than mine.\nBernadette: And Leonard loves you so much, he married you twice.\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99m not even engaged once. I don\xe2\x80\x99t even know if Sheldon thinks about marriage. I\xe2\x80\x99m not getting any younger. Honestly, I kind of thought by now, we might have had some sort of\xe2\x80\xa6\nBernadette: Careful. The sound of crying can make me lactate.\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. I can\xe2\x80\x99t help it.\nPenny: Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s gonna make me cry.\nBernadette: And there they go.\nPenny: Ew.\nScene: Sheldon and Amy\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nLeonard: Well, Sheldon, turns out we didn\xe2\x80\x99t need you after all.\nHoward: That\xe2\x80\x99s right. We figured it out all by ourselves. Wasn\xe2\x80\x99t even that hard.\nLeonard: No.\nSheldon: Well, good for you guys. Look, I have a grease smudge on my hand, and I\xe2\x80\x99m okay with it.\nLeonard: Aren\xe2\x80\x99t you gonna look at the board to see how right we are?\nSheldon: No, thanks. I\xe2\x80\x99m busy trying to fix this fuel pump.\nHoward: It\xe2\x80\x99s a manifold.\nSheldon: Oh. Well, I guess it\xe2\x80\x99s fixed.\nLeonard: Just look at the board.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s wrong.\nLeonard: Oh, no, what should we have done differently?\nSheldon: Well, first of all, you can\xe2\x80\x99t use relativistic and non-relativistic vectors in the same equation.\nHoward: Told ya. Can you fix it for us?\nSheldon: Okay, but this is the last time. Nice try, blockheads.\nLeonard: Come on, Sheldon. You can\xe2\x80\x99t turn your back on physics, and besides, you have no idea what you\xe2\x80\x99re doing with this stuff.\nHoward: But if you really want to learn the mechanical side, I can teach you anything you want to know.\nLeonard: And instead of standing around watching, you can help us build your smaller guidance system.\nHoward: And with all these new skills, you\xe2\x80\x99d be able to fix any model train. You\xe2\x80\x99d be the king of the train store.\nSheldon: Excuse me. I have a girlfriend. I\xe2\x80\x99m already king of the train store.\nLeonard: So, what do you say?\nSheldon: Oh, what choice do I have? You need me. I\xe2\x80\x99m like the crankshaft of this team.\nHoward: That\xe2\x80\x99s a turbo.\nSheldon: Well, whatever it is, it looks heavy. I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna need you two to get it downstairs before Amy comes home.\nScene: The cab of a steam locomotive.\nSheldon: I apologize that it\xe2\x80\x99s so warm in here.\nAmy: It is warm in here.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99ve worked up a bit of a sweat.\nAmy: Me, too.\nSheldon: May I borrow your water?\nSheldon (voice): The light\xe2\x80\x99s green.\nAmy (now in her car): Sorry.\nSheldon: GPS says we\xe2\x80\x99ll be at the railway in three hours.\nAmy: I can get us there in two.\nAdvertisements'
