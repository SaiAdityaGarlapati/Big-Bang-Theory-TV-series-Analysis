b'After a \xe2\x80\x9cpreviously on\xe2\x80\x9d segment.\nScene: The apartment.\nPenny: Champagne, champagne.\nLeonard: Thank you.\nPenny: And for the world\xe2\x80\x99s tallest second grader, apple juice.\nSheldon: Thank you. No bendy straw, some party.\nLeonard: Hey, a toast. Thank you all for your support while we worked on our Air Force project. And please know that we could not have done it without you, so cheers.\nAll: Cheers.\nAmy: You know, it\xe2\x80\x99s nice of you to acknowledge us, but this is your accomplishment.\nBernadette: Yeah, you guys did this all on your own.\nRaj: Without me.\nSheldon: To success without Raj.\nBernadette: So what happens next?\nHoward: Phase two, we test it, perfect it, and hope to live long enough to see the movie based on our lives starring more attractive versions of us.\nSheldon: Yeah, I\xe2\x80\x99ll definitely live long enough. Vitamin C.\nLeonard: First thing tomorrow morning, we\xe2\x80\x99re back at it.\nRaj: Without me.\nSheldon: I hope his character doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make it into the movie, he\xe2\x80\x99s kind of a bummer.\nScene: Outside the lab.\nComputer Voice: Leonard Hofstadter. Access granted.\nLeonard: Hmm. I don\xe2\x80\x99t care if this thing is burning out my retinas, it makes me feel special. Now, before we field test, I think we\xe2\x80\xa6\nHoward: What the hell?\nLeonard: Where is everything?\nSheldon: Who else has access to this room?\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s a secure lab in a classified facility, only the U.S. government and us.\nSheldon: This is disconcerting.\nHoward: But the movie did just get good.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The laboratory .\nLeonard: Sir, I, I, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry but I just don\xe2\x80\x99t get it. You came into our lab in the middle of the night and took our prototype and all of our research and didn\xe2\x80\x99t even tell us?\nCol. Williams: Sounds like you get it.\nHoward: But why would you do that?\nCol. Williams: You guys completed phase one, we\xe2\x80\x99ll take it from here.\nSheldon: Where did you move it?\nCol. Williams: I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell you that.\nLeonard: Are you implementing phase two?\nCol. Williams: I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell you that.\nSheldon: Wait, so you\xe2\x80\x99re just going to take all the work we\xe2\x80\x99ve done for the last year and toss us aside?\nCol: Williams: That one I can tell you, yes.\nHoward: This is all very upsetting.\nCol. Williams: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry to hear that. As you know, the primary focus of the United States military is people\xe2\x80\x99s feelings.\nSheldon: If that\xe2\x80\x99s sarcasm, please save it for our enemies.\nScene: The apartment.\nRaj: I may be moving out soon. I think I found a place to live.\nPenny: Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry to hear that.\nRaj: Really? You kept sending me apartment listings.\nPenny: Um, well, I, yeah, you got me.\nAmy: Where are you moving?\nPenny: And when? But also where?\nRaj: Bert has a room for rent.\nBernadette: So you\xe2\x80\x99re gonna be roommates with Bert?\nRaj: Uh, no, it\xe2\x80\x99s, uh, pretty private, actually, it\xe2\x80\x99s over his garage. So the only time I\xe2\x80\x99ll see him is when he pulls his car in, does his laundry or practices drums in my dining room.\nAmy: Well, good for you. I actually have a little news myself.\nPenny: Okay, we\xe2\x80\x99re just gonna circle back to when he\xe2\x80\x99s moving out? Okay, that\xe2\x80\x99s cool.\nAmy: I was, uh, asked to be a visiting researcher at Princeton.\nBernadette: Hey, that\xe2\x80\x99s amazing.\nPenny: Good for you.\nRaj: Congratulations.\nAmy: Thanks, but the thing is I\xe2\x80\x99ll be gone for a few months and I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s gonna feel about that.\nPenny: Oh, come on, he\xe2\x80\x99s a grown man, he can take care of himself.\nAmy: You really believe that?\nPenny: Once again, you got me.\nScene: The stairwell.\nHoward: How can you work on something for a year and they just take it?\nLeonard: I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe the Air Force would treat us like that.\nSheldon: You know, I have a good mind to stop paying my taxes. It\xe2\x80\x99s too bad I enjoy doing them so much. The Air Force did it again. They\xe2\x80\x99re erasing our lives.\nLeonard: Third floor, wrong apartment.\nHoward: Although, if anyone\xe2\x80\x99s gonna clean out your apartment and disappear, it\xe2\x80\x99d be Penny.\nLeonard: She might disappear, but she\xe2\x80\x99s definitely not cleaning anything.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s okay, everything\xe2\x80\x99s here.\nPenny: Oh, hey, what\xe2\x80\x99s going on?\nLeonard: You won\xe2\x80\x99t believe it, the military confiscated our project.\nPenny: What?\nBernadette: You\xe2\x80\x99re kidding. Why would they do that?\nHoward: They wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say.\nSheldon: I feel so betrayed. You know, all my life I thought Uncle Sam was a friendly uncle who brought you presents. Turns out he\xe2\x80\x99s the other kind.\nAmy: Sheldon, I\xe2\x80\x99m so sorry.\nSheldon: Thank you. Can we just talk about something else?\nLeonard: Yeah, what\xe2\x80\x99s going on with you guys?\nHoward: Give us some good news.\nPenny: Amy\xe2\x80\x99s got some news.\nAmy: Yeah, um, Raj is moving out.\nLeonard: Oh, no. When?\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s van.\nBernadette: You doing okay?\nHoward: Not really.\nBernadette: Want me to put on some Neil Diamond? That always makes you feel better.\nHoward: No. Then you\xe2\x80\x99ll get all sexed up and I\xe2\x80\x99m not in the mood. I mean, an entire year wasted.\nBernadette: You might be forgetting another accomplishment of the past year.\nHoward: Oh. Yeah, yeah, we brought life into the world.\nBernadette: Really? That\xe2\x80\x99s the importance you put on us having a baby?\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m happy about it, but, I mean, it\xe2\x80\x99s not like I did much. I mean, after the first three minutes it was pretty much all you.\nScene: The apartment.\nPenny (on phone): So, did you tell him about Princeton yet?\nAmy: No, I\xe2\x80\x99m waiting till he\xe2\x80\x99s in a good mood.\nPenny: Oh, sweetie, you might not live that long.\nAmy: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, maybe I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go.\nPenny: Oh, stop it, he\xe2\x80\x99ll be fine.\nAmy: I guess. And he\xe2\x80\x99ll have you and Leonard right across the hall the whole time.\nPenny; Oh, damn, wait, you know, maybe you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go.\nAmy: Got to go. Morning.\nSheldon: I apologize for exceeding my allotted bathroom time.\nAmy: Are you feeling okay?\nSheldon: Not really. Apparently grief can make one less regular.\nAmy: Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry to hear that.\nSheldon: No, I sat and I sat, but to no avail.\nAmy: Oh, the more details, the more sorry. Well, maybe this\xe2\x80\x99ll cheer you up. I made your favorite oatmeal, plain.\nSheldon: What\xe2\x80\x99s the occasion?\nAmy: No occasion, I just wanted to do something nice for you.\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re so kind. You know, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how I ever got by without you.\nAmy: Oh. That\xe2\x80\x99s sweet, but you, you did just fine on your own.\nSheldon: Well, I thought that, too, but I\xe2\x80\x99ve come to realize, I am completely dependent on you.\nAmy: Sheldon, you\xe2\x80\x99re, you\xe2\x80\x99re being silly.\nSheldon: No, to wake up every morning and know you\xe2\x80\x99re there is a great comfort to me. Mmm, tasteless. How do you do it?\nAmy: You know, what you need to do is put this Air Force project behind you and just dive into something new.\nSheldon: Well, there is our quantum cognition experiment. You and I could spend more time on that.\nAmy: Oh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, I mean, let\xe2\x80\x99s say we succeed in proving that our consciousness creates reality. I mean, what will we have really accomplished? You know, a loaf of bread\xe2\x80\x99s still three bucks.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m confused. You\xe2\x80\x99re always saying that you want to spend more time with me.\nAmy: That is true, I have said that.\nSheldon: Well, a lot, it\xe2\x80\x99s very annoying. Has something changed? Um, is there something that you\xe2\x80\x99re not telling me?\nAmy: I was offered a summer research fellowship at Princeton.\nSheldon: Princeton? A fine institution. The place where Albert Einstein taught. And where Leonard got his PhD, so it may have gone downhill.\nAmy: Yeah, that\xe2\x80\x99s the one.\nSheldon: Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s wonderful. Congratulations.\nAmy: Well, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t accepted it yet. I wanted to talk to you first.\nSheldon: What is there to talk about? You have to take it. It\xe2\x80\x99s important.\nAmy: So are you.\nSheldon: Thank you, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll be fine.\nAmy: Are, are you sure?\nSheldon: Yes. I may have lost my guidance system and my girlfriend, but I still have a colon full of yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s meals to keep me company. Although, thanks to your high fibre breakfast, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that\xe2\x80\x99ll be leaving me, too.\nScene: A park.\nBernadette: Really? He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t put raisins or banana slices or anything in it?\nAmy: I don\xe2\x80\x99t think plain oatmeal was the point of that story.\nPenny: I mean, I like a little brown sugar.\nAmy: Guys.\nPenny: Sorry.\nBernadette: You\xe2\x80\x99re still gonna go, right?\nAmy: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s so vulnerable right now.\nPenny: Oh, come on. Look, if the roles were reversed, he\xe2\x80\x99d be on the first train to New Jersey, or the second train if there were teenagers on the first one.\nBernadette: Well, distance might be nice. The last time a big project ended for Howie, he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t stop following me around. He even went with me to get a mammogram.\nPenny: Well, what\xe2\x80\x99s wrong with that?\nBernadette: No, he wanted to get one with me, like some kind of weird couple\xe2\x80\x99s massage.\nPenny: And yet you bore his child. Neato.\nBernadette: You\xe2\x80\x99re excited about this opportunity, right?\nAmy: Of course. I get to be part of the first team to use radon markers to map the structures that\xe2\x80\xa6\nPenny: Okay, a simple yes will do.\nBernadette: You have to go.\nAmy: I know, but what if Sheldon\xe2\x80\xa6\nPenny: Okay, listen to me. Your relationship can handle being long distance for a while. It\xe2\x80\x99s not like you two are very physical.\nAmy: Hey, you don\xe2\x80\x99t know what goes on behind closed doors.\nPenny: A lot of lectures?\nAmy: All right, so you know.\nBernadette: I\xe2\x80\x99m telling you, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t go you\xe2\x80\x99ll end up regretting it.\nHoward: Hey, wait up.\nBernadette: Oh, great.\nHoward: You left something at home. A big hug.\nBernadette: Oh.\nHoward: I found it right next to these kisses.\nBernadette: It\xe2\x80\x99s too late for me. Save yourself.\nScene: The stairwell.\nLeonard: So, are you excited to have your own place again?\nRaj: I am, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll miss you guys.\nLeonard: Ah, we\xe2\x80\x99ll miss you, too.\nRaj: You could try saying that without smiling.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m trying. This is the best I can do. What are you doing?\nSheldon: What does it look like? I\xe2\x80\x99m playing sad harmonica in an apartment as empty as my heart.\nRaj: Why?\nSheldon: I got the blues. My baby done left me.\nRaj: Come on, Sheldon. Amy\xe2\x80\x99s only gone for a few months. And now that I\xe2\x80\x99m moving out, your old room is empty, so you can stay there whenever you want.\nLeonard: Uh, could I talk to you in the hall for a sec?\nRaj: Yeah, sure.\nLeonard: Sheldon, you\xe2\x80\x99re being silly.\nSheldon: Am I? Yesterday I had an Air Force project, a girlfriend who lived with me, and my good friend Raj right across the hall.\nLeonard: Do you really care about that last one?\nSheldon: No, but that list was sounding a little thin.\nLeonard: Instead of dwelling on the negative, think about this. Your girlfriend was given an amazing opportunity, which gives you an opportunity to show her that you\xe2\x80\x99re a loving and supportive boyfriend.\nSheldon: So trick her.\nLeonard: All right, let me start again. Uh, you and Amy\xe2\x80\xa6\nRaj (outside): Can I get my stuff? Sounds like it\xe2\x80\x99s gonna be a while.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s bathroom.\nHoward: I missed you.\nBernadette: Come here, let\xe2\x80\x99s talk.\nHoward: Ooh. Sounds serious. Have I been a bad boy? Am I gonna get a spanking \xe2\x80\x99cause you know.\nBernadette: Just listen. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if you realize this, but whenever you\xe2\x80\x99re between projects, you tend to get a little insecure.\nHoward: Oh.\nBernadette: A little clingy.\nHoward: I know and I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.\nBernadette: Oh, oh, oh, okay, stop. Stop. I love when you\xe2\x80\x99re affectionate, but this is not coming from a good place.\nHoward: Well, excuse me, but what did you do when you worked on that allergy drug for two years and the FDA shut down your project?\nBernadette: I signed us up for ballroom dance class.\nHoward: Okay, and what did you do when they took you off the antifungal team?\nBernadette: I made us have a baby.\nHoward: So?\nBernadette: Bring it in.\nHoward: And now the movie just got rated R.\nScene: Sheldon and Amy\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nAmy: Hey. You going somewhere?\nSheldon: No, but you are, so I got you this as a present.\nAmy: Sheldon, that isn\xe2\x80\x99t necessary.\nSheldon: No, it is. Leonard pointed out to me that I\xe2\x80\x99m not always a loving and supportive boyfriend, so here\xe2\x80\x99s some quality luggage.\nAmy: Thank you.\nSheldon: The salesman said it could survive a plane crash, so perhaps you should fly inside it.\nAmy: Does this mean you\xe2\x80\x99re okay with me going?\nSheldon: Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not looking forward to it, but it is a wonderful opportunity and you need to take it. Besides, Princeton is in New Jersey, so it\xe2\x80\x99s not like you\xe2\x80\x99re gonna want to stay. Uh, I know it\xe2\x80\x99s not your birthday, but if you\xe2\x80\x99re interested\xe2\x80\xa6\nAmy: I am.\nSheldon: Okay. Oh, and just to be clear, I\xe2\x80\x99m not being intimate with you in order to keep you from going.\nAmy: I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t thinking that.\nSheldon: Well, no, it\xe2\x80\x99s just, I\xe2\x80\x99m just warning you, you know, if you find yourself 3,000 miles away and craving a hit of this, you know, I can\xe2\x80\x99t Skype it to you.\nAmy: That\xe2\x80\x99s a risk I\xe2\x80\x99m willing to take.\nSheldon: All right, then. Let\xe2\x80\x99s go to the bedroom, remove our clothes, fold them neatly and engage in frenzied lovemaking.\nAmy: What if we don\xe2\x80\x99t fold our clothes at all?\nSheldon: Or, what if we fold them?\nScene: The apartment doorway.\nRaj: Well, here\xe2\x80\x99s your key back.\nLeonard: Thank you.\nRaj: As soon as I have the place set up I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna have you guys over.\nPenny: Oh, we would love that.\nRaj: I really can\xe2\x80\x99t thank you enough for taking me in. You know, I was in a pretty low place in my life.\nSheldon (off): Oh, Amy, you naughty vixen.\nRaj: Anyway, uh, as I was saying, I was at a pretty low place in my life and, uh, if it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t for friends\nlike you\xe2\x80\xa6\nAmy (off): My goodness, that form of stimulation is highly efficient.\nRaj: I can\xe2\x80\x99t compete with that. Bye.\nLeonard: Should we give them their privacy?\nPenny: I want to, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I can.\nSheldon (off): Whoopee!\nPenny: Okay, I\xe2\x80\x99m good now.\nScene: Sheldon and Amy\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nAmy: Okay, the car is waiting. Do you want to walk me downstairs?\nSheldon: Of course. Here, here, let me. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been doing a little research on New Jersey, and I was delighted to learn that their chief agricultural product is sod.\nAmy: Is it?\nSheldon: Hmm, yes. Yeah, perhaps I\xe2\x80\x99ve been harder on them than they deserve.\nAmy: Do you think it\xe2\x80\x99s possible you might enjoy being on your own for a little while?\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to say. I\xe2\x80\x99ve never really lived by myself. What if I become strange and eccentric?\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99ll love you no matter what.\nSheldon: Howard Hughes saved his urine in milk bottles.\nAmy: We\xe2\x80\x99ll cross that bridge when we come to it.\nSheldon: And you\xe2\x80\x99ll text me when you arrive at the airport?\nAmy: I will.\nSheldon: And when you\xe2\x80\x99re at the gate?\nAmy: Uh-huh.\nSheldon: And if you see any actors from Game of Thrones in first class?\nAmy: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what they look like, but sure.\nSheldon: And don\xe2\x80\x99t forget to Skype me when you arrive.\nAmy: I won\xe2\x80\x99t.\nSheldon: And every morning.\nAmy: Got it.\nSheldon: Now of course, my 9am is your noon, so let\xe2\x80\x99s avoid the whole good morning, good afternoon minefield, and let\xe2\x80\x99s just say hello.\nAmy: Good thinking.\nSheldon: And just remember, I am proud of you and I support you in all that you do.\nAmy: Thank you. That means a lot.\nSheldon: Oh, and one last thing. If you find yourself working with a male scientist who\xe2\x80\x99s as smart as me, as tall as me and has hair like Thor, well, then I want you to step away from the situation and call me immediately.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
