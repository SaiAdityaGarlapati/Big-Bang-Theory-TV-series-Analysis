b'Scene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Hello. I\xe2\x80\x99m Doctor Sheldon Cooper, and welcome to Sheldon Cooper presents Fun with Flags, the final episode flagtacular. I knew it was coming. Still scary. Now, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you\xe2\x80\x99re thinking, the final episode? Who will stand between us and flag ignorance?\nAmy: I know I was thinking that. Is this a show on flags or mind reading?\nSheldon: But the truth is I can no longer balance a full-time career, a popular Internet show, and a girlfriend.\nAmy: And he really does have one, you jerks on the comment board.\nSheldon: So as they say, all good things must come to an end.\nAmy: After only 232 episodes.\nSheldon: 233 if we include the one somebody forgot to press record on.\nAmy: You said you weren\xe2\x80\x99t gonna bring that up.\nSheldon: And you said you pressed record. Anyway, please sit back, relax, and join us as we take our final lap, as indicated by the waving of this racing flag. And, of course, white flags can also represent surrender, the Stewards of Gondor, and the Japanese Minamoto clan, but I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you remember that from episode sixty-two, White Flags, Who\xe2\x80\x99s Wavin\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Em and Why?\nAmy: That was a good one.\nSheldon: It was so good.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: An office at the university.\nRaj: You know, I thought cleaning out a dead professor\xe2\x80\x99s office was gonna just be boring, but then I found his dentures and realized it\xe2\x80\x99s also gross.\nHoward: Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t Professor Abbott\xe2\x80\x99s family want any of this stuff?\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t think he had a family.\nRaj: That\xe2\x80\x99s rough.\nLeonard: I know. You can spend your whole life working, and at the end all that\xe2\x80\x99s left are some papers in a box.\nHoward: Makes you think. Oh, well.\nLeonard: Hey. Hey, we\xe2\x80\x99re supposed to look through all this stuff before we throw it away in case it\xe2\x80\x99s important.\nHoward: I did. It\xe2\x80\x99s all outdated or disproved.\nRaj: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. This old pen kind of proves gravity. When I tilt it, her bathing suit falls right off.\nHoward: Oh, my dad used to have a pen like that. I dated it all through sixth grade.\nLeonard: It still feels weird just throwing away his work like this.\nHoward: Don\xe2\x80\x99t feel bad. Someday someone will be throwing out your work, too.\nLeonard: That someone was Sheldon, and the day was yesterday. Hey, look at this. Dear Roger, to be opened upon your first great discovery. Love, Mom. Wow, look at the date. He saved this fifty years and never got to open it.\nHoward: That\xe2\x80\x99s intense.\nRaj: Poor Roger Abbott.\nHoward: Roger Abbott sounds just like Roger Rabbit.\nRaj: Roger Abbott, Roger Abbott, Roger Abbott. Oh, my God, Leonard, I know he\xe2\x80\x99s dead, but try it. It\xe2\x80\x99s fun. Roger Abbott, Roger Abbott.\nScene: A hotel conference room.\nDan: Penny. Oh, my rookie of the year.\nPenny: Oh, Dan. My boss who didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to hire me and now\xe2\x80\x99s a little hug machine.\nDan: Oh, look at you. Brand-new and already the third best sales rep.\nPenny: Aw.\nDan: Yes. Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you come over to my table.\nPenny: I\xe2\x80\x99ll be right there. Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s just parking the car.\nDan: Oh, good. Bernadette. Cute, sweet, vicious little Bernadette.\nPenny: Come on. She\xe2\x80\x99s not that bad.\nDan: Oh, yeah? At the company picnic she yelled at me and my grandson for losing the three-legged race. I mean, he still calls her that mean kid with the big boobies.\nPenny: I know she can be a little intense, but, I swear, she is so sweet once you get past all the\xe2\x80\xa6\nBernadette: Hey, what are you talking about?\nPenny: Oh. We were just talking about how much we love working with you. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that right? Dan?\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Over the years here at Fun With Flags, we\xe2\x80\x99ve had an opportunity to learn, laugh, wonder.\nAmy: And, yes, even shed a tear or two.\nSheldon: Like when you do a two-hour Fourth of July spectacular and it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get recorded.\nAmy: How many times do I have to say I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry?\nSheldon: How about four thousand. One for every domino I set up to make that American flag. Please enjoy these highlights.\nHighlight 1\nSheldon: Crikey, what flag do we have today?\nAmy: Australia, mate.\nHighlight 2\nSheldon: And now it\xe2\x80\x99s time for the speed round of Flag or Not a Flag.\nKripke: Fwag, fwag, not a fwag, fwag, I am cwushing this.\nHighlight 3\nAmy: Say, Betsy Ross, what you working on?\nSheldon: I have no idea. Because the story of me sewing the first American flag is unsupported poppycock.\nAmy: Then who did sew it, hmm?\nSheldon: Don\xe2\x80\x99t ask me. I\xe2\x80\x99m just a simple seamstress whose descendants are out to make a quick buck.\nHighlight 4\nSheldon: Fancy a dip, my dear?\nAmy: I do.\nSheldon: Wait, that purple flag indicates that marine pests, such as jellyfish, are present.\nAmy: Wow, that flag is a lifesaver.\nSheldon: No. This is. Stop looking at my legs.\nHighlight 5\nKripke: Not a fwag, fwag, fwag, not a fwag. Fwag. Ugh cwap.\nScene: The office.\nRaj: When stuff like this gets me down, you know what I like to do?\nHoward: Sing Hakuna Matata like an eight-year-old girl?\nRaj: Wrong, smarty-pants. It\xe2\x80\x99s Everything Is Awesome from The Lego Movie.\nLeonard: Look at these notebooks. They\xe2\x80\x99re full of pages and pages of data. He clearly spent years on this.\nHoward: Mmm. It\xe2\x80\x99s just columns of random numbers. Toss it.\nLeonard: Well, but what if this was a potential breakthrough for him? What if, what if this is the thing that would\xe2\x80\x99ve finally let him open that bottle of champagne?\nRaj: Maybe he didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what to pair champagne with. Strawberries, caviar, oysters. All good choices. Yeah, that look right there is why people eat before they come to your parties.\nLeonard: This has to mean something.\nHoward: Well, there\xe2\x80\x99s no discernible pattern that I can see, but it shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be too hard to run the numbers and check.\nLeonard: Well, maybe we can get some time on the supercomputer.\nHoward: Sure. We could try multiple regressions with varying physical and experimental constants.\nLeonard: Oh, we could run a pattern-matching algorithm against well-known unsolved physics problems.\nHoward: Ooh, it might be a substitution cipher. We could start with basic cryptanalysis.\nRaj: Or we could talk to this guy he used to share an office with.\nHoward: Oh, let\xe2\x80\x99s do that.\nLeonard: Because you don\xe2\x80\x99t know how to do cryptanalysis, do you?\nHoward: Yeah, I\xe2\x80\x99m not even sure if it\xe2\x80\x99s the right word.\nScene: The conference room.\nPenny: So, Dan, you have a grandson. How old is he?\nDan: Seven.\nBernadette: Oh, yeah. I remember him from the picnic. He was the one crying like a wuss the whole time.\nPenny: I heard he was being picked on by a mean kid.\nBernadette: Just builds character. Like my dad said, nobody likes a crybaby except their mommies and Democrats.\xe2\x80\x9d\nDan: I need another drink.\nBernadette: What\xe2\x80\x99s his problem?\nPenny: Oh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Maybe he didn\xe2\x80\x99t like the fact that you called his grandson a wuss.\nBernadette: Well, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t think you were supposed to say sissy anymore.\nPenny: Okay, look, I know what a good person you are, but sometimes people think you might come off a little harsh.\nBernadette: What? I\xe2\x80\x99m, like, the sweetest person I know. Look at me. I should be in a tree baking cookies.\nPenny: Yes, but once in a while, people think you\xe2\x80\x99re a little mean.\nBernadette: Oh, yeah? You one of those people?\nPenny: No. No, no, no. I think the cookie thing.\nScene: The apartment.\nAmy: Action.\nSheldon: Welcome back. Our guest today is a returning fan favourite. He puts the reading in your rainbow, the Geordi in your La Forge, and the Kunta in your Kinte, Mr. LeVar Burton.\nLeVar Burton: Thank you, Sheldon. Now, remember our deal.\nSheldon: You do this, I delete your contact information.\nLeVar: While?\nSheldon: While you watch me do it.\nLeVar: Great. Happy to be back.\nSheldon: Well, since you\xe2\x80\x99re here, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to get your opinion on something. In honour of Black History Month, I portrayed George Washington Carver in a loving tribute that my roommate called wildly racist. What do you think? (On recording) Hi. My name is George.\nLeVar: Oh, hell, no.\nSheldon: You heard him, Leonard. No, it\xe2\x80\x99s not racist.\nScene: An apartment building.\nHoward: Are we sure this is the place?\nRaj: The doorman said this is the right building.\nLeonard: I think if you\xe2\x80\x99re pulling up your pants, you\xe2\x80\x99re not a doorman. (Knocks)\nMan (off): Who is it?\nLeonard: Uh, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been looking for a Professor Sharpe?\nProf Sharpe: Hold on. Can I help you?\nLeonard: Hi. We\xe2\x80\x99re from the university. We\xe2\x80\x99re trying to get some information about Professor Abbott.\nHoward: We were cleaning out his office and found these books full of numbers.\nLeonard: Any chance you know what it is?\nProf Sharpe: Yes, he was always working on this.\nRaj: I was thinking it might be some sort of interstellar coordinate system, maybe an updated version of Hubble\xe2\x80\x99s law. I keep seeing the number 90 repeating. That could be the angle of perturbation of a distant galaxy.\nProf Sharpe: It\xe2\x80\x99s the number of calories in a yoghurt. That\xe2\x80\x99s his food diary.\nLeonard: Really?\nProf Sharpe: Yeah, he wrote down everything he ever ate. He was convinced that calorie restriction was the key to living forever.\nRaj: Does it work?\nHoward: Seriously?\nRaj: Well, he could have been hit by a bus. You don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\nProf Sharpe: Sorry it\xe2\x80\x99s not more interesting. On the bright side, you didn\xe2\x80\x99t have to listen to his stomach growl for 35 years.\nLeonard: So, was there anything that Professor Abbott worked on during his life that came close to an accomplishment?\nProf Sharpe: To be honest, his research never amounted to anything.\nRaj: You were his colleague. How did your research turn out? Great. Hey, this is the apartment you get when you win a Nobel.\nRaj: Well, you could be very frugal. I\xe2\x80\x99m getting a little tired of everybody\xe2\x80\x99s sarcasm.\nScene: The conference room.\nBernadette: I\xe2\x80\x99m not a bully. I mean, maybe I come off a little strong, but that\xe2\x80\x99s only because my dad raised me to be tough and not to take crap from anybody.\nPenny: No. That\xe2\x80\x99s fine, but there\xe2\x80\x99s a difference between being tough and telling your friend her new pants look like a saggy diaper.\nBernadette: I did say that, didn\xe2\x80\x99t I?\nPenny: Yeah, you did. I felt so self-conscious, I had to return them.\nBernadette: Where? To Babies R Us?\nPenny: You\xe2\x80\x99re doing it again.\nBernadette: Okay, sorry. Can we just go? I feel like everybody hates me.\nPenny: Oh, come on, they don\xe2\x80\x99t hate you, all right? They\xe2\x80\x99re just a little intimidated. All you need to do is show everyone how sweet you really are.\nBernadette: I think I\xe2\x80\x99d rather go.\nPenny: No, come on. You are not going anywhere, all right? I am here for you, and we are gonna fix this together.\nBernadette: Thank you.\nPenny: Even though your dress is ugly.\nScene:The apartment.\nSheldon: Well, my little flag-keteers, it looks like the last episode of Fun with Flags is at an end. If I could, I would run each and every one of you viewers up a flagpole and salute you. And if you touched the ground, burn you. I\xe2\x80\x99d like to take a moment to personally thank Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler, who you may or may not know is the first woman to co-host a flag or banner-related Internet info-tainment show.\nAmy: Take that, glass ceiling.\nSheldon: And if I may get serious for a moment, hosting this show has been one crazy ride. But with all its ups and downs, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t give it up for the world. Except for now, when I\xe2\x80\x99m giving it up. Before I sign off, I\xe2\x80\x99d, uh, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to share with you all one last use for a white flag. It\xe2\x80\x99s good for times like this. Good night.\nAmy: Cut. Sheldon, that was beautiful.\nSheldon: If you didn\xe2\x80\x99t press record\xe2\x80\xa6\nAmy: I pressed it.\nScene: The office.\nLeonard: Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s it. That\xe2\x80\x99s the end of Roger Abbott.\nRaj: And we still don\xe2\x80\x99t know who framed him.\nLeonard: I still keep thinking about how an entire life can seemingly amount to nothing.\nHoward: I guess the sad truth is, not everyone will accomplish something great. Some of us may just have to find meaning in the little moments that make up life.\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99s a nice way of looking at it.\nHoward: Yeah for you, not for me. I went to space. I\xe2\x80\x99m covered.\nLeonard: You know what? This bottle was meant to celebrate an achievement. Let\xe2\x80\x99s make a pact. When one of us gets their first big breakthrough, we\xe2\x80\x99ll celebrate by opening this bottle of champagne and toasting Professor Abbott.\nHoward: I love that.\nRaj: Yeah, me, too.\nLeonard: Then, of course, rubbing our success in Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s face.\nRaj: Oh, well, that\xe2\x80\x99s the best part.\nHoward: Oh, yeah.\nScene: The conference room.\nBernadette: Dan, could I talk to you for a minute?\nDan: Sure, go ahead.\nBernadette: Just want you to know I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to be rude about your grandson.\nDan: No, it\xe2\x80\x99s okay.\nBernadette: No, it\xe2\x80\x99s not. Penny told me that everyone\xe2\x80\x99s scared of me.\nDan: What? What? Why would she say that? You know she drinks, right?\nPenny: What?\nBernadette: No, she\xe2\x80\x99s right, and I just want you to know that from now on, I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna be much more sensitive. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want anyone walking on eggshells around me.\nDan: Oh, well, okay, then, uh, one thing I\xe2\x80\x99ve been meaning to tell you is that the company is gonna stop paying for our coffee.\nBernadette: No problem. When does that start?\nDan: Five months ago.\nBernadette: What?\nDan: Yeah.\nBernadette: Who\xe2\x80\x99s been paying for my coffee?\nDan: All of us.\nPenny: Yeah. It comes from the swear jar we put money in when you curse.\nBernadette: What else don\xe2\x80\x99t I know about?\nPenny: Uh, well, you know your private bathroom?\nBernadette: Yeah?\nPenny: That was supposed to be for the whole floor.\nBernadette: You\xe2\x80\x99re kidding.\nDan: No, no. It\xe2\x80\x99s okay. It only really affected Wheelchair Kathy, and she\xe2\x80\x99s back in the hospital now, so it all worked out.\nBernadette: I feel so bad.\nPenny: Well, then, maybe you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have named her Wheelchair Kathy.\nBernadette: Oh, my God. I thought everybody liked me, but I\xe2\x80\x99m just a monster.\nDan: But a cute one, like that, uh, eyeball guy in Monsters, Inc.\nBernadette: No, I\xe2\x80\x99m the worst. I\xe2\x80\x99m a terrible person.\nDan: Come on, don\xe2\x80\x99t cry. It\xe2\x80\x99s okay.\nBernadette: It\xe2\x80\x99s not okay. How can I even work here anymore?\nPenny: Because this company needs you.\nDan: It\xe2\x80\x99s fine. We don\xe2\x80\x99t mind paying for the coffee.\nBernadette: I can\xe2\x80\x99t let you do that.\nDan: Maybe we could get you an espresso machine for your office.\nBernadette: I guess that would be all right.\nPenny: See? You don\xe2\x80\x99t have to be mean to get what you want.\nBernadette: You\xe2\x80\x99re right. Now where did we land on my bathroom?\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: Hey.\nSheldon: Hello.\nLeonard: How come you\xe2\x80\x99re up so late?\nSheldon: I posted the last episode of Fun with Flags hours ago, and not a single person cared enough to comment. All that effort for nothing.\nLeonard: Mm. I know how you feel. I spent the day throwing out a man\xe2\x80\x99s entire career, and all that\xe2\x80\x99s left is an old bottle of champagne and a naked lady pen that Raj took when he thought no one was looking.\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s not the same thing. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you know how I feel at all.\nLeonard: Sad?\nSheldon: Hmm. You do get me. Someone left a comment.\nLeonard: Yeah. What did they say?\nSheldon: Too bad your show is done. I kind of liked it. Leonard, did you hear that? Oh, the people are heartbroken. I can\xe2\x80\x99t take this away from the world. Fun with Flags is back.\nLeonard: Congratulations.\nSheldon: Let\xe2\x80\x99s celebrate.\nLeonard: Sheldon, that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t for you.\nSheldon: Oh, no, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to drink it. I just wanted to hear the pop. Yeah, I knew it was coming. Still scary.\nScene: LeVar Burton\xe2\x80\x99s house.\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) LeVar Burton? (Knock, knock, knock) LeVar Burton? (Knock, knock, knock) LeVar Burton?\nLeVar: Ugh. What are you doing here?\nSheldon: You told me not to call, and I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know how else to give you the good news. Fun with Flags is back, and you can be in the next episode.\nLeVar: Wil Wheaton said, get a gate. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why I didn\xe2\x80\x99t get a gate.\nSheldon: You, at least listen to the premise. Since you were born in Germany, I thought we could talk\nabout German flags. How do you feel about dressing up like a swastika?\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
