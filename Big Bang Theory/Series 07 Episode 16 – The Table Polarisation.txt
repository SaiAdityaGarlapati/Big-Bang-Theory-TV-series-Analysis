b'Scene: The apartment\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking about growing a goatee.\nRaj: Oh, actually that\xe2\x80\x99s a Van Dyke. A goatee is just hair on the chin.\nLeonard: Oh. Wait, then what is it if you just have hair up here?\nRaj: You mean a moo-stache?\nLeonard: Moo-stache.\nHoward: He said it.\nRaj: Ha-ha, very funny. Make fun of the foreign guy. For your information, there are four times as many Indians as there are Americans, so the way we say it is right.\nHoward: Say what?\nRaj: Moo-stache.\nLeonard: Moo-stache.\nHoward: He said it.\nBernadette: Guys, you\xe2\x80\x99re being childish.\nSheldon: Yeah, she\xe2\x80\x99s right. You\xe2\x80\x99re grown men, the kind who are perfectly capable of growing your own moo-staches.\nAmy: Hey, you were funny on purpose, good job.\nPenny: Hi. Sorry I\xe2\x80\x99m late, I was at an audition.\nLeonard: Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99ll get \xe2\x80\x99em next time.\nPenny: How about instead of assuming I failed, you ask me how it went?\nLeonard: Sorry. How did it go?\nPenny: Just shut up.\nRaj: Here, you can have your seat.\nPenny: No, no, no, stay there. I\xe2\x80\x99m fine on the floor.\nBernadette: Have you guys ever thought about getting a dining room table?\nAmy: Yeah. You actually do have room for one up there.\nRaj: Oh, sure, I sit on the floor for years, no one cares. The pretty white girl\xe2\x80\x99s there ten seconds, and suddenly we\xe2\x80\x99re all running to IKEA.\nSheldon: No one is running anywhere. We\xe2\x80\x99re not getting a dining room table.\nLeonard: I know you don\xe2\x80\x99t like change, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not a terrible idea.\nPenny: Yeah, you guys never use that space up there. Why not get a table?\nSheldon: Do you want the long answer or the short answer?\nHoward: Hey, how come we never get that option?\nSheldon: Chaos theory suggests that even in a deterministic system, if the equations describing its behaviour are non-linear, a tiny change in the initial conditions can lead to a cataclysmic and unpredictable result.\nPenny: Translation?\nLeonard: Waah. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want a table.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: Hey, Penny and I are gonna go shop for a dining room table. You want to come with us?\nSheldon: You know, I\xe2\x80\x99d love to, but, um, I\xe2\x80\x99m too busy falling back in love with Windows 98.\nLeonard: Seriously? You haven\xe2\x80\x99t used this desk in years. The second I want to get rid of it, you\xe2\x80\x99re up here working?\nSheldon: I can\xe2\x80\x99t talk right now, I have several thousand updates to install.\nLeonard: Are you really gonna sit here all day?\nSheldon: Think of me as Arthur Dent in Hitchhiker\xe2\x80\x99s Guide to the Galaxy, lying in front of the bulldozers to protect his home.\nLeonard: If you\xe2\x80\x99ll recall, the Vogon fleet blew up the Earth anyway.\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s a made-up story, Leonard, I don\xe2\x80\x99t even know why you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about it.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m putting all this stuff in storage. We don\xe2\x80\x99t need any of it.\nSheldon: You, how can you say that? You show me one thing in here we can live without.\nLeonard: Oh, hang on. Check your in-box.\nSheldon: Wait. Is this really worth it? We\xe2\x80\x99ve lived together for years with nary an argument.\nLeonard: Huh?\nSheldon: But we start talking about a table, and suddenly we\xe2\x80\x99re at each other\xe2\x80\x99s throats.\nLeonard: Nary an argument? Nary?\nSheldon: Well, that means not one, or not any. Maybe instead of a table, you should buy a dictionary. Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if I won that, but at least he\xe2\x80\x99s upset.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nHoward: Check it out.\nRaj: Magic wand TV remote?\nHoward: Yeah, I can control all sorts of stuff.\nRaj: Did Bernadette think it was cool?\nHoward: Not when I said mute and pointed it at her face.\nRaj: Oh, uh, let me try. Uh, channelis changeroni. This might be my second favorite brown magic wand.\nHoward: Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s the last time I play with that. (Phone rings) I have to take this. Hello? 00:04:24,137\nRaj: Uh, off. And on. And the Oprah Network. This is so much better than watching TV like a muggle.\nHoward: Okay. Thank you. We\xe2\x80\x99ll be in touch. You\xe2\x80\x99re not gonna believe this.\nRaj: What\xe2\x80\x99s going on? Oh. Wait. On. And off. What\xe2\x80\x99s going on?\nHoward: That was NASA. They want me to go back up to the space station.\nRaj: Wow. What did you tell them?\nHoward: I told them I\xe2\x80\x99d be honoured.\nRaj: A second trip to space, I\xe2\x80\x99ll miss you.\nHoward: And I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna miss you, too.\nRaj: And I just want you to know, I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to look in on Bernadette while you\xe2\x80\x99re gone.\nHoward: Thank you.\nRaj: And if anything were to happen to you, we will name our first born son Howard. I\xe2\x80\x99m just kidding. We\xe2\x80\x99ll name him Dalib, after my grandfather.\nScene: A furniture store.\nPenny: Ooh, this one looks nice.\nLeonard: No. Sheldon doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like reclaimed wood.\nPenny: Why not?\nLeonard: He\xe2\x80\x99s afraid the original owners will come back.\nPenny: Yeah. Well, Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s not here.\nLeonard: Well, he is here. So unless you want to dig him out with a bone saw and a melon baller, there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing I can do about it.\nPenny: All right, sweetie, you\xe2\x80\x99re paying for this table, and it\xe2\x80\x99s your apartment, too.\nLeonard: I know, but\xe2\x80\xa6\nPenny: No buts. You got to stop letting him boss you around.\nLeonard: You\xe2\x80\x99re right. I mean, he decides what TV shows we watch, what food we eat, who my favourite hobbit is. I wanted Frodo, but we can\xe2\x80\x99t both have Frodo, so guess who\xe2\x80\x99s stuck with Samwise Gamgee.\nPenny: See? Right there. You\xe2\x80\x99re a grown man, you should be able to pick whichever hobbit you want. Wish you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t, but one problem at a time.\nLeonard: You make a lot of sense. I like this table, and I\xe2\x80\x99m getting it.\nPenny: Really? This one?\nLeonard: That one? Damn right I like that one.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nBernadette: Hey.\nHoward: Good news. Someone in this room gets to take a ride on a rocket.\nBernadette: Fine. Can I at least shower first?\nHoward: No, not that. Although you already agreed to it, so no take-backs.\nBernadette: What are you talking about?\nHoward: Sit down. NASA called. The telescope mount I installed on the space station got damaged, and they want me to go back up and fix it.\nBernadette: Wow. Well, what did you say?\nHoward: What do you think I said? I said yes. Why do you look surprised?\nBernadette: Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s just, after last time, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t think you\xe2\x80\x99d ever want to go back.\nHoward: Are you kidding? It was the greatest experience of my life.\nBernadette: Really? \xe2\x80\x98Cause I kind of remember a lot of complaining and wishing for it to be over.\nHoward: I think you have me confused with what\xe2\x80\x99s gonna happen when you get out of that shower.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: Hey, all set. What do you think? There\xe2\x80\x99s plenty of room for everybody, a view out the window.\nSheldon: My spot on the couch has a great view of a window. Sometimes I can see space battles through it. It\xe2\x80\x99s called a TV.\nPenny: Give it a chance, Sheldon, you might actually like it.\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re absolutely right. Nope.\nPenny: Well, you can\xe2\x80\x99t say he didn\xe2\x80\x99t give it a fair shot.\nSheldon: So, when can we get rid of it?\nLeonard: We\xe2\x80\x99re not.\nSheldon: What about the roommate agreement? It specifically states that any changes in furnishing have to be approved by the Furnishing Committee. Which only sits on alternate years. Yeah, and by the way, it sits over there.\nPenny: Come on, that is ridiculous.\nLeonard: She\xe2\x80\x99s right, a committee that important should meet more often.\nPenny: That\xe2\x80\x99s not what I\xe2\x80\x99m saying.\nLeonard: Oh. This is the thing about me standing up to him and not letting him run my life?\nPenny: Yes.\nLeonard: That.\nSheldon: Okay. I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve found the problem here. It\xe2\x80\x99s not the table at all. It\xe2\x80\x99s you.\nPenny: Me?\nLeonard: Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s always me, take one for the team.\nSheldon: I have spent years turning this lump of clay into an acceptable conduit for my will, and then you came along and reshaped him, with your newfangled ideas and your fancy genitals.\nPenny: Are you gonna let him talk to me like this?\nLeonard: Fancy sounds like a compliment.\nPenny: Okay, I have not tried to change Leonard. That\xe2\x80\x99s just what happens in relationships. Look how much Amy\xe2\x80\x99s changed you.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s not true.\nPenny: Oh, please. When I first met you, you were incapable of touching another human being. Now you\xe2\x80\x99re holding hands, you\xe2\x80\x99re going on dates, you even made out with her on a train.\nSheldon: She told you?\nPenny: Of course she told me, it\xe2\x80\x99s the most interesting thing that\xe2\x80\x99s ever happened to her in her entire life.\nLeonard: You\xe2\x80\x99re too close to it, but Amy has had a huge impact on you.\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re right. Without realizing it, I\xe2\x80\x99ve allowed that woman to alter my personality.\nLeonard: Mm, Sheldon, you didn\xe2\x80\x99t have a personality, you just had some shows you liked.\nSheldon: No. No, I\xe2\x80\x99ve changed. Like the frog who\xe2\x80\x99s put in a pot of water that\xe2\x80\x99s heated so gradually he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t realize he\xe2\x80\x99s boiling to death.\nPenny: Or you\xe2\x80\x99re the frog who\xe2\x80\x99s been kissed by a princess and turned into a prince.\nLeonard: Or you\xe2\x80\x99re just a tall, annoying frog.\nSheldon: Excuse me. I have to break up with my girlfriend.\nPenny: Oh, Sheldon, wait.\nSheldon: No. You\xe2\x80\x99ve opened my eyes to the truth. Amy has made me a more affectionate, open-minded person. And that stops now.\nLeonard: Well, we should call her.\nPenny: Yeah, mm-hmm. Amy, it\xe2\x80\x99s Penny. Hey. Just a little heads-up. Leonard bought a dining room table. Yeah. Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s breaking up with you.\nScene: Amy\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Amy? (Knock, knock, knock) Amy? (Knock, knock, knock) Amy? I\xe2\x80\x99ll get right to the point. I think we need to end this relationship, so just sign this with your finger, and, uh, please don\xe2\x80\x99t cry on my iPad, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t get AppleCare.\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99m not surprised you want to end the relationship. I\xe2\x80\x99m a little surprised you didn\xe2\x80\x99t get AppleCare. Anyway, enjoy your life. Where do I sign?\nSheldon: At the bottom. I must say, I\xe2\x80\x99m relieved you\xe2\x80\x99re not making more of a scene out of this.\nAmy: Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99ve already moved on. Besides, this breakup has nothing to do with me.\nSheldon: It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t?\nAmy: Of course not. This is just Leonard trying to take the focus off that dreadful table by sowing discord in our relationship. He\xe2\x80\x99s manipulating you like he always does.\nSheldon: Wait, wait, now, hang on. You think he manipulates me?\nAmy: All the time. And he knew that, as your girlfriend, I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t gonna stand by and let him bring a table into your apartment. I mean, a table? Come on?\nSheldon: It is hideous.\nAmy: Well, thankfully, I won\xe2\x80\x99t have to see it, \xe2\x80\x99cause I won\xe2\x80\x99t be your girlfriend anymore. Amy Farrah Fowler. Why, yes, I would like to take a survey.\nSheldon: Wait. You were really gonna stand by me against the dining room table?\nAmy: Of course I was.\nSheldon: Wait. How do I know that you\xe2\x80\x99re not manipulating me right now?\nAmy: I think if I were manipulating you, you\xe2\x80\x99d be smart enough to see it.\nSheldon: How do I know you\xe2\x80\x99re not saying that as part of the manipulation?\nAmy: I think you\xe2\x80\x99d be smart enough to see that, too.\nSheldon: Okay. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry I gave you such a hard time, I just had to be sure.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nRaj: It\xe2\x80\x99s pretty exciting that NASA wants to send Howard back up.\nBermadette: Yeah, exciting. Can I ask you something?\nRaj: Course.\nBernadette: He hated that entire experience. Does it make me an awful wife if I don\xe2\x80\x99t think he should do it again?\nRaj: Not at all. He\xe2\x80\x99s forgotten how miserable he was the entire time he was up there. It\xe2\x80\x99s like me in those moments when I miss India.\nBernadette: So you\xe2\x80\x99ll talk to him?\nRaj: Why me?\nBernadette: Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m his wife, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to ruin it for him.\nRaj: That\xe2\x80\x99s the dynamic, I\xe2\x80\x99m the fun one, you\xe2\x80\x99re the buzzkill.\nBernadette: Since when am I the buzzkill?\nRaj: Do you think this is cool?\nBernadette: No, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s stupid.\nRaj: Aha.\nBernadette: You\xe2\x80\x99re right, it\xe2\x80\x99s great.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Hello.\nLeonard: Oh, hey. You guys didn\xe2\x80\x99t break up.\nSheldon: No. Sorry to disappoint you, but Amy pointed out that you were only trying to manipulate me.\nAmy: Which you also figured out by yourself.\nSheldon: Which I also figured out by myself.\nPenny: Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m glad you\xe2\x80\x99re still together.\nSheldon: Yeah, okay, you can stop trying to make this about our relationship.\nAmy: Which is stronger than ever.\nSheldon: Which is stronger than ever. This is about you trying to change my environment, which was perfect the way it was.\nHoward: But it got the way it was through change. The-the-the spot that you love to sit in, that no one else can sit in, only exists because, despite your objections. I bought this couch. Me. So explain why that change was bad and this change was good.\nSheldon: Um.\nAmy: You don\xe2\x80\x99t need to explain yourself to him.\nSheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t need to explain myself to you!\nAmy: You\xe2\x80\x99re sick of his nonsense and ready to move in with me.\nSheldon: Keep the table. We don\xe2\x80\x99t use that space.\nAmy: Damn it, I got cocky.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nHoward: Hey, Bernie. I\xe2\x80\x99m home. Hello.\nBernadette: Hi, honey.\nHoward: What\xe2\x80\x99s going on?\nBernadette: Maybe you should have a seat.\nHoward: Um, okay. I know my mom\xe2\x80\x99s not dead, there\xe2\x80\x99d be balloons.\nRaj: Um, okay. First off, know that we all love you and cherish you.\nMike Rostenkowski: Well, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\xa6\nBernadette: Daddy.\nMike R: You\xe2\x80\x99re great.\nMike Massimino (on skype): Can I say something?\nRaj: Oh, of course.\nMike M: Hey, Fruit Loops.\nHoward: Massimino? Why are you here?\nMike M: Well, I heard you were thinking about going back up to the space station, and as someone who\xe2\x80\x99s been there with you, well, you know how astronauts need to have the right stuff?\nHoward: Sure.\nMike M: The stuff you have is wrong.\nHoward: You don\xe2\x80\x99t think I did a good job up there?\nMike M: You did a fine job. It\xe2\x80\x99s just, you were scared and miserable the whole time.\nBernadette: I think what we\xe2\x80\x99re all trying to say is, you don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to be remembering how traumatic the experience was for you.\nRaj: Like how women often forget the pain of childbirth.\nMike R: Like a woman. Great analogy.\nHoward: Fine, maybe I was a little scared.\nMike M: You peed in your space suit.\nHoward: You\xe2\x80\x99re supposed to do that.\nMike M: Not during the fitting.\nMike R: Son, do I need to remind you what you asked me to do before you went up last time?\nHoward: Hang on. That was just me joking around.\nMike R: You wanted me to shoot you in the foot.\nHoward: Come on, how is that not a joke? You got to get me out of this. Shoot me in the foot.\nBernadette: Don\xe2\x80\x99t forget all the other astronauts picking on you.\nRaj: And how you threw up in zero gravity, and it floated back in your mouth. And you threw up again. And so on and so on.\nMike M: That was funny.\nHoward: Okay, so I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t exactly John Glenn up there, but I\xe2\x80\x99ve changed. I\xe2\x80\x99m a different man now. Yeah, and I\xe2\x80\x99m a little insulted that you guys don\xe2\x80\x99t think I can handle it.\nMike M: You know you\xe2\x80\x99re gonna have to go through survival training again.\nHoward: Really?\nScene: A doctor\xe2\x80\x99s surgery.\nHoward: You\xe2\x80\x99ve got to get me out of this.\nDoctor: What do you want me to do? You\xe2\x80\x99re perfectly healthy.\nHoward: Check my blood pressure again. I can get it higher. just give me a second. (Dials phone)\nMrs Wolowitz (on phone): Hello?\nHoward: Hi, Ma. How are you?\nMrs Wolowitz: How I am is not dead, but you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t know that, because you don\xe2\x80\x99t love me enough to pick up the phone.\nHoward: Go, go, go.\nMrs Wolowitz: For all you know, I could have slipped in the tub and drowned. That\xe2\x80\x99s what happened to your Aunt Ida.\nDoctor: Wow.\nScene: The apartment.\nRaj: Howard, I\xe2\x80\x99m so sorry your blood pressure was off the charts.\nHoward: Oh, me, too. I mean, the doctor was willing to fudge the results, but it just seemed so darned dishonest.\nLeonard: But the mission wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be for at least a year. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that enough time to get your blood pressure under\xe2\x80\xa6\nHoward: Look, my blood pressure\xe2\x80\x99s too high, okay? Drop it.\nPenny: You know, my aunt changed her diet, and in a few months, she\xe2\x80\xa6\nHoward: Went to space? I don\xe2\x80\x99t think so. Now, pass the soy sauce. Hey, not the green one, the red one.\nPenny: Sheldon, Amy, will you please come join us?\nBernadette: Yeah, it\xe2\x80\x99s fun up here.\nLeonard: So why are you trying to ruin it?\nSheldon: No, thanks. We\xe2\x80\x99re fine. I mean, if you people want to eat at the table, then that\xe2\x80\x99s what you should do. I like eating down here because this is how we\xe2\x80\x99ve always done things. But if those days are gone, they\xe2\x80\x99re gone. It just makes me sad.\nBernadette: Now I feel bad.\nLeonard: Oh, don\xe2\x80\x99t anthropomorphize him, he\xe2\x80\x99s got big eyes, but his feelings are not like ours.\nBernadette: No, it just seems silly for us to sit in two groups.\nLeonard: Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s not silly if you think of that group as being led by a big, evil baby.\nBernadette: Look at Amy down there. Should we go?\nPenny: Yeah, let\xe2\x80\x99s go.\nLeonard: But Penny, this was your idea. You said that I should stand up to him.\nPenny: Forget it, Leonard. It\xe2\x80\x99s over.\nLeonard: Fine.\nAmy: Rajesh?\nRaj: Screw that! I sat on the floor for seven years. I\xe2\x80\x99m staying right here.\nBernadette: Come on, Raj, it\xe2\x80\x99s not the same without you.\nRaj: Fine. But no more making fun of how I say tings.\nHoward: You mean tings like moo-stache?\nSheldon: Well, isn\xe2\x80\x99t this nice. Sometimes the baby wins.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
