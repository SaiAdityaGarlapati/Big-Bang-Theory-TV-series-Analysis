b'Scene: The apartment.\nHoward: Okay, are you from Star Wars universe?\nLeonard: Yes\nHoward: Were you in the original trilogy?\nLeonard: Yes\nHoward: Is there a picture of you in my wallet wearing a metal bikini?\nLeonard: God, I hope not. And no, I\xe2\x80\x99m not Princess Leia.\nRaj: Oh, okay, okay, my turn. Are you in the six Star Wars movies?\nLeonard: Yes\nRaj: Interesting. Are you a Droid?\nLeonard: Yes\nRaj: Do you kind of look like a shiny Sheldon?\nLeonard: Yes\nRaj: C3PO.\nLeonard: You got it.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s preposterous. I do not resemble C3PO. Don\xe2\x80\x99t get me wrong, I\xe2\x80\x99m flattered, I just don\xe2\x80\x99t see it.\nHoward (phone rings): Leslie Winkle. You\xe2\x80\x99ve reached friends with benefits. For a booty call, press one now.\nSheldon: What exactly does that expression mean, friends with benefits? Does he provide her with health insurance?\nLeonard: No. Look, imagine you maintained a friendship with someone you had sex with, but you were free to date whoever you wanted.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, I can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine any of that.\nLeonard: Alright, back to the game.\nSheldon: I believe it\xe2\x80\x99s my turn, you may begin your questions whenever you\xe2\x80\x99re ready.\nRaj: Are you Spock?\nSheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t like this game.\nHoward: So, where were we?\nRaj: Aren\xe2\x80\x99t you leaving for your booty call?\nHoward: No, it was something else. Why does everything have to be about sex with you? Come on. Who\xe2\x80\x99s turn is it?\nLeonard: We were up to you.\nHoward: Great, just start.\nLeonard: Okay, let\xe2\x80\x99s see. Are you from a TV series?\nHoward: She dumped me!\nSheldon: I bet he\xe2\x80\x99s someone from Babylon 5, we\xe2\x80\x99re never going to guess.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: A few moments later.\n  Raj: What happened with Leslie, why did she dump you?\nHoward: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. She just said Howard, momma\xe2\x80\x99s a rolling stone. And then her call waiting beeped and she was gone.\nSheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand. If you were in a non-emotional relationship then why are you having  what appears be an emotional response?\nLeonard: Sheldon, he obviously had feelings for her.\nHoward: Of course I had feelings for her, I saw her naked for God\xe2\x80\x99s sake!\nLeonard: Okay, uh look, you just need to get your mind off it. Do you want to go to the comic book store? Maybe go see a movie?\nHoward: I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to go anywhere.\nSheldon: You know, I\xe2\x80\x99m given to understand that there is an entire city in Nevada designed specifically to help people like Howard forget their problems. Where  you can replace them with new problems such as alcoholism, gambling addiction and sexually transmitted diseases.\nRaj: Is it me, or was that Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s way of saying Vegas baby!\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99ve never been there, have you?\nRaj: Me? No. I just got Vegas baby from Vince Vaughn in Swingers. .\nHoward: It could be fun. I know my weekend\xe2\x80\x99s wide open, now that\xe2\x80\xa6\nLeonard: Okay, then let\xe2\x80\x99s do this, lets go to Las Vegas.\nHoward: Now? Right now?\nLeonard: Why not? People do things right now all the time. Why can\xe2\x80\x99t we be right now people too. Go home, pack a bag and we\xe2\x80\x99ll be right now people. I have to stop at the drug store to refill a prescription, but after that we\xe2\x80\x99ll go right now.\nRaj: What do you say, Howard?\nHoward: I say Vegas baby!\nRaj: What are you going to tell your mother?\nHoward: Sea World, baby!\nLeonard: Hey, Sheldon, are you coming?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99d rather have a blowfly lay eggs and hatch larvae in my auditory canal.\nLeonard: Great, we\xe2\x80\x99ll bring you back a tee-shirt.\nScene: The lobby.\nSheldon: Thank you. Hello, neighbour.\nPenny: Hello, Sheldon.\nSheldon: And how are you doing this fine evening?\nPenny: Great.\nSheldon: Good. I\xe2\x80\x99m glad.\nPenny: Really? Are you drunk?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m just in a good mood. While my compatriots are in Las Vegas, I will be enjoying a blissful evening in my personal Fortress of Solitude.\nPenny: That\xe2\x80\x99s Superman\xe2\x80\x99s big ice thing, right?\nSheldon: Do you know, I\xe2\x80\x99m such a good mood, I\xe2\x80\x99m actually finding your tenuous grasp of the English language folksy and charming today.\nPenny: Mmm, what smells so good?\nSheldon: That is the intoxicating aroma of Kadhai Paneer, a perfect culinary representation of the freedom this evening holds. Not only is it Indian cuisine, which Koothrappali loathes, it contains a generous helping of peanuts, which would reduce Wolowitz to a wheezing 97 pound blister. And finally, it\xe2\x80\x99s main ingredient is Paneer, a farmer\xe2\x80\x99s cheese which would cause Leonard to render any room uninhabitable within minutes.\nPenny: Yum. Well, enjoy your big evening.\nSheldon: Penny. I realize you are also on your own tonight, so if at some point you find yourself with nothing to do, please do not disturb me.\nPenny: Have fun, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Oh, I shall. (Sings Superman theme while searching his pockets.) No!\nPenny: What\xe2\x80\x99s wrong, Superman? Locked out of your big ice thingy?\nScene: A Vegas bathroom.\n  Raj: Look at this, mouthwash, lotion, body wash, shampoo and conditioner together in one tiny bottle. I love Las Vegas.\nLeonard: Howard, could I borrow some after shave?\nHoward: Black case, top compartment.\nLeonard: That is a lot of cologne.\nHoward: First row are your musks, second is wood, leathers and botanicals, third is assorted pheromones, tread lightly.\nRaj (finding a large quantity of condoms): That\xe2\x80\x99s the spirit, Howard. Yes, we can.\nLeonard: Come on, let\xe2\x80\x99s go.\nHoward: You guys go ahead, I just have to finish up an email.\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99s not an email, that\xe2\x80\x99s Leslie\xe2\x80\x99s facebook page.\nHoward: Okay, fine, I\xe2\x80\x99m checking her facebook page, look at her status update, she\xe2\x80\x99s saying she dumped me, people need to know I dumped her.\nRaj: But she did dump you.\nHoward: Grow up, Raj,there\xe2\x80\x99s no place for truth on the internet. Just go, I\xe2\x80\x99ll catch up with you.\nLeonard: Alright.\nRaj: Oh, we should have a plan in case one of us gets lucky.\nLeonard: Okay, uh, if I get lucky I\xe2\x80\x99ll take her to my stately manor outside Gotham City, and if you get lucky, I\xe2\x80\x99ll sleep on the moon.\nRaj: Sounds like a plan.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nPenny: Hang on, I think the emergency key is around here somewhere.\nSheldon: We have a bowl. Our keys go in a bowl. You should get a bowl.\nPenny: So, how did the beautiful mind of Sheldon Cooper forget his key in the first place.\nSheldon: I left them in the bowl.\nPenny: Oh-oh. I just remembered where the emergency key is.\nSheldon: Where?\nPenny: In your apartment.\nSheldon: What\xe2\x80\x99s it doing in my apartment?\nPenny: Well, I went in there a few weeks ago when you guys weren\xe2\x80\x99t home, and I forgot it there.\nSheldon: You were in my\xe2\x80\xa6 why would you\xe2\x80\xa6 what are you saying?\nPenny: It\xe2\x80\x99s not a big deal, I was making coffee and I ran out of milk.\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re the milk thief! Leonard said I was crazy but I knew that carton felt lighter.\nPenny: Alright, Sheldon, let\xe2\x80\x99s just calm down and we\xe2\x80\x99ll call the building manager, he\xe2\x80\x99ll come open your door, you just eat your dinner here while you\xe2\x80\x99re waiting.\nSheldon: Eat? My dinner? In your apartment?\nPenny: Yeah, why not?\nSheldon: Sure, why not? And after the sun\xe2\x80\x99s down we can all pile in my pick-up and go skinny-dipping down at the creek. \xe2\x80\x98Cause today\xe2\x80\x99s the day to stop making sense.\nScene: A bar at the Las Vegas Casino.\n  Leonard (to barmaid): Thanks.\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99m telling you, Leonard, video slot machines, free drinks brought to us by a bosomy barmaid and all you can eat shrimp for $3.95. Disneyland can suck it. This is the real happiest place on earth.\nLeonard (as he wins on his slot machine): Dude, check it out. That\xe2\x80\x99s laundry for a month!\nWoman (leaning over Raj): Hi.\nRaj (taking a big gulp of his drink): Hello.\nWoman: What\xe2\x80\x99s your name?\nRaj: Rajesh Ramayan Koothrappali.\nWoman: Hello Rajesh Ram\xe2\x80\xa6 Hi, Rajesh, I\xe2\x80\x99m Michaela.\nRaj: Hello, Michaela.\nMichaela: So, are you interested a little party?\nRaj: Why, yes, I love to party. Party is my middle name. Or it would be, if it weren\xe2\x80\x99t Ramayan.\nLeonard: Uh, Raj, can I, can I talk to you for a moment.\nRaj: Not now, Leonard, Michaela\xe2\x80\x99s inviting me to a party. You better call the moon and you make sure that they have a bed for you.\nLeonard: Yeah, I really need to talk to you.\nRaj: Excuse me, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be right back. Don\xe2\x80\x99t go anywhere. Don\xe2\x80\x99t move. Just stay the beautiful unspoiled American flower that you are. (To Leonard) What\xe2\x80\x99s wrong with you dude, that woman was all up in my jammy.\nLeonard: Okay, I hate to break this to you and whatever your jammy is, but, I\xe2\x80\x99m pretty sure she is a prostitute.\nRaj: What? No. ..\nLeonard: Okay, let me put it this way, in your entire life, how many gorgeous women have walked straight up to you in a bar and asked if you wanted to party.\nRaj: Maybe I can save her.\nLeonard: Maybe, but I\xe2\x80\x99m guessing it will cost you about $500 an hour to try.\nRaj: It was lovely meeting you, best of luck in your future endeavours.\nMichaela: Whatever.\nRaj: Oh, I miss her already.\nLeonard: Oh, Howard\xe2\x80\x99s losing it. Check out his latest twitters. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m at the bottom of a black hole staring into the abyss. My life is meaningless, my future is without hope.\xe2\x80\x9d\nRaj: Why don\xe2\x80\x99t we take him to see the Blue Man Group?\nLeonard: You think that\xe2\x80\x99d help?\nRaj: USA Today calls them exuberant fun for the whole family.\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, Howard isn\xe2\x80\x99t really the family fun kind of guy.\nRaj: It\xe2\x80\x99s too bad he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t here for that hooker. She\xe2\x80\x99s exactly his type. A hooker. You know, I bet if we hired her, that would cheer him up.\nLeonard: We\xe2\x80\x99re not going to get Wolowitz a hooker.\nRaj (reading Howard\xe2\x80\x99s twitter): \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m so lonely and horny I may open this $20 jar of peanuts and end it all.\xe2\x80\x9d\nLeonard: Suppose it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t hurt to get an estimate.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\n  Sheldon: So, how was your day?\nPenny: Are you trying to make small talk? Oh, sweetie, you really don\xe2\x80\x99t have to.\nSheldon: No, it\xe2\x80\x99s the accepted convention. How was your day?\nPenny: Well, uh, they shifted my schedule around at the restaurant so my hours are going to be a little different\xe2\x80\xa6\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, that\xe2\x80\x99s not going to interest me at all, just eat.\nScene: The casino bar.\n  Raj: Hello again.\nMichaela: Oh, hi.\nLeonard: Yeah, hi, listen, m, if you\xe2\x80\x99re not busy, well, w-we were thinking you could\xe2\x80\xa6 well, we were wondering\xe2\x80\xa6\nRaj: If you\xe2\x80\x99re really a prostitute.\nMichaela: You guys cops?\nTogether: No.\nMichaela: I am a prostitute.\nLeonard: Okay, great. Um\xe2\x80\xa6 uh, the thing is, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got this friend, and he\xe2\x80\x99s kind of down in the dumps, and we thought that maybe you could cheer him up.\nRaj: With sex.\nLeonard: I think she knows what I meant.\nRaj: How can she when you beat around the bush. She\xe2\x80\x99s from the mean streets where they shoot from the hip and keep it real.\nMichaela: Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry, I can take good care of your friend.\nLeonard: Okay, terrific. Um, uh, listen, is there a way that we can do this where he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know that you\xe2\x80\x99re a\xe2\x80\xa6 you know\xe2\x80\xa6\nRaj: Prostitute.\nMichaela: You want the girlfriend experience.\nLeonard: Yes, yeah, exactly, the girlfriend experience.\nRaj: Uh, actually, if it\xe2\x80\x99s not too much to ask, could we have the Jewish girlfriend experience.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\n  Sheldon: Okay, that\xe2\x80\x99s question 20, you have to guess.\nPenny: Oh, God, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know Sheldon, are you Star Wars?\nSheldon: How can one person be a whole movie?\nPenny: Okay, I give up, can we just do something else?\nSheldon: Fine. I was Spock. Are you and Leonard friends with benefits.\nPenny: What?\nSheldon: Are you and Leonard friends with benefits?\nPenny: Where did that even come from, did he say we were?\nSheldon: No, Leonard said nothing, but who knows what goes on over here when he pretends your mail was misdelivered.\nPenny: No, just mail, no benefits.\nSheldon: Hmm, I see.\nPenny: Why are you asking?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m curious about the whole social construct. On its face, the idea of satisfying ones sexual appetite, assuming one is afflicted with such, without emotional entanglement, that seems eminently practical. What I\xe2\x80\x99ve observed, however, is Howard Wolowitz crying like a little girl.\nPenny: Well, some people just can\xe2\x80\x99t handle that kind of relationship.\nSheldon: Can you?\nPenny: Excuse me?\nSheldon: Are you able to have sex with men without developing an emotional attachment?\nPenny: Sheldon, I really don\xe2\x80\x99t want to talk about this with you.\nSheldon: Is this conversation making you uncomfortable?\nPenny: Of course it\xe2\x80\x99s making me uncomfortable, can\xe2\x80\x99t you tell?\nSheldon: I really have no idea. I don\xe2\x80\x99t particularly excel at reading facial expressions, body language\xe2\x80\xa6\nPenny: I\xe2\x80\x99m uncomfortable, Sheldon!\nSheldon: Thank you, that\xe2\x80\x99s very helpful.\nScene: The casino bar.\nHoward: Alright, where are these amazing shrimp?\nLeonard: Behold?\nHoward: Seriously, you think this is the size of a baby\xe2\x80\x99s arm?\nRaj: A little baby.\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m going back to the room.\nMichaela (arriving): Boy, would it maybe kill them to put out a nice brisket?\nHoward: Hi there, Howard Wolowitz.\nMichaela: Esther Rosenblatt.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\n  Penny: I don\xe2\x80\x99t think the manager\xe2\x80\x99s coming tonight so, here.\nSheldon: Are you suggesting I sleep on the couch.\nPenny: Well, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the first suggestion that came to mind, but it\xe2\x80\x99s the one I\xe2\x80\x99m going with.\nSheldon: I can\xe2\x80\x99t sleep on your couch. I sleep in a bed. And given it\xe2\x80\x99s dimensions I have no intention of living out E.M. Snickering\xe2\x80\x99s beloved children\xe2\x80\x99s book , The Tall Man From Cornwall.\nPenny: What?\nSheldon: There was a tall man from Cornwall whose length exceeded his bed. My body fits on it, but barely upon it, there\xe2\x80\x99s no room for my big Cornish head.\nPenny: Oh, alright. I will give you my bed on one condition. That you promise to zip your hole for the next eight hours.\nSheldon: May I say one last thing.\nPenny: Only if it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t rhyme.\nSheldon: Alright. Goodnight.\nScene: The casino bar.\nMichaela: Turn ons. Let me see. Reading a good book in front of the fire. Long walks on the beach. Getting freaky on the Sabbath with a bacon cheeseburger.\nHoward: Really, me too.\nMichaela: Oy gevalt, you\xe2\x80\x99re hot.\nHoward: Yeah. Excuse me for a moment.\nLeonard: Hey, how\xe2\x80\x99s it going.\nHoward: Cut the crap, you set this up, didn\xe2\x80\x99t you?\nLeonard: Yes.\nHoward: She\xe2\x80\x99s a hooker, isn\xe2\x80\x99t she.\nRaj: A prostitute, yes.\nHoward: You already gave her the money?\nLeonard: Yes.\nHoward: Thank you!\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\n  Sheldon: Penny.\nPenny: What?\nSheldon: I can\xe2\x80\x99t sleep. how are you going?\nPenny: Maybe that\xe2\x80\x99s because your hole is still open.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m homesick.\nPenny: Your home is twenty feet from here.\nSheldon: Twenty feet, twenty light years, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter. It\xe2\x80\x99s in a galaxy far, far away.\nPenny: Damn it. What do you want me to do\nSheldon: Sing soft kitty.\nPenny: That\xe2\x80\x99s only for when you\xe2\x80\x99re sick.\nSheldon: Homesick is a type of being sick.\nPenny: Come on, do I really have to?\nSheldon: I suppose we can stay up and talk.\nPenny: Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur. Happy kitty, um\xe2\x80\xa6\nSheldon: Sleepy kitty.\nPenny: Sleepy ki\xe2\x80\xa6\nSheldon: No. Start over.\nPenny: Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur. Happy kitty, sleepy kitty, purr, purr, purr.\nSheldon: Penny.\nPenny: Yeah.\nSheldon: Thank you for letting me stay here.\nPenny: Oh, you\xe2\x80\x99re welcome sweetie.\nSheldon: Okay, I\xe2\x80\x99m sleepy now, get out.\nScene: The stairwell.\n  Sheldon: Oh, good, you\xe2\x80\x99re finally home.\nLeonard: What were you doing at Penny\xe2\x80\x99s?\nSheldon: Well, we had dinner, uh, played some games, and then I spent the night. Oh, you\xe2\x80\x99ll be happy to know that I now have a much better understanding of friends with benefits.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
