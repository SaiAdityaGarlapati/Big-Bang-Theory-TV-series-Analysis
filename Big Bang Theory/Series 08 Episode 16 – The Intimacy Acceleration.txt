b'Scene: The apartment.\nAmy: I just read about an experiment designed to see if you could make two people fall in love in a matter of hours.\nLeonard: That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t sound right. My research has shown that it takes three to five years of shameless begging.\nPenny: Honey, neither of us comes off good in that story.\nRaj: Yeah, I, I, I saw that article you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about. Uh, the participants ask each other a series of questions designed to promote intimacy.\nAmy: And then they finish it off by staring into each other\xe2\x80\x99s eyes for four minutes.\nSheldon: Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s nonsense. I proclaimed my love for you. And the last time I looked into your eyes was when you thought you had conjunctivitis.\nAmy: Other than the fact that I had it, that was a magical night.\nPenny: Raj, would you ever try an experiment like that with Emily?\nRaj: What? I don\xe2\x80\x99t need science to win her heart. I have my family\xe2\x80\x99s wealth for that.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m telling you, you can\xe2\x80\x99t create love in a few hours. Right?\nPenny: Oh, careful. You\xe2\x80\x99re poking at the whole foundation of The Bachelor.\nSheldon: Yeah, but we don\xe2\x80\x99t have to debate this. We\xe2\x80\x99re scientists. We can conduct our own research. I propose that we imprison two street people and\xe2\x80\xa6\nAmy: No.\nSheldon: You didn\xe2\x80\x99t even let me finish.\nAmy: Forget it.\nSheldon: So, you can experiment on all the apes you want. But I want to manipulate the emotions of two captive human beings, suddenly I\xe2\x80\x99m the monster.\nRaj: Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you just do the test?\nSheldon: In the interest of science, I\xe2\x80\x99d be willing to.\nPenny: What? You\xe2\x80\x99re okay with an experiment where you have to answer awkward questions about your innermost feelings?\nSheldon: Yes.\nPenny: Please, can I do it with him? Please?\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99ve been listening to Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s feelings on things for ten years. Tag, you\xe2\x80\x99re it.\nRaj: Yeah, but what if the experiment works?\nPenny: I\xe2\x80\x99m not gonna fall in love with Sheldon.\nAmy: That\xe2\x80\x99s what I said. Before I knew it, he pontificated his way right into my heart.\nSheldon: Uh, fun fact, pontificate comes from the Latin word pontifex, which means bridge builder or Pope.\nLeonard: In love yet?\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The hallway.\nSheldon: Just out of curiosity, Penny, if this experiment does make us fall in love, would you drive me to Lake Geneva, Wisconsin for Gary Con? It\xe2\x80\x99s the only convention celebrating the life and work of Gary Gygax, the co-creator of Dungeons and Dragons.\nPenny: You know what? I can honestly say if we fall in love, not only will I drive you there, I will buy you all the dragon T-shirts you want.\nSheldon: Okay, babe, let\xe2\x80\x99s do this.\nScene: The apartment.\nRaj: You guys are really being calm about Penny and Sheldon doing this thing. If it were me I\xe2\x80\x99d, I\xe2\x80\x99d be a little nervous.\nAmy: Why?\nRaj: Well, even if the study\xe2\x80\x99s nonsense, I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe in tempting fate. Same reason I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t use a Ouija board, or pick a fight with an Asian guy. He probably doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know karate, but why risk it?\nAmy: I think we\xe2\x80\x99re safe.\nRaj: Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s what the bullies at Bruce Lee\xe2\x80\x99s high school thought. And then, bam. Karate.\nLeonard: Well, are we just gonna sit here while they do the experiment?\nAmy: The two of us could do it.\nLeonard: Yeah, sure, that might be fun.\nAmy: What\xe2\x80\x99s the first question?\nRaj: Hang on. Okay. Given the choice of anyone in the world, whom would you want as a dinner guest?\nLeonard: Hmm. I can honestly say Penny.\nAmy: Oh, then I choose a janitor, \xe2\x80\x99cause I\xe2\x80\x99m about to throw up.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m in love. Let\xe2\x80\x99s do something else.\nRaj: Ooh, uh, Emily gets off work soon. Why don\xe2\x80\x99t the four of us go out?\nLeonard: Okay.\nAmy: Sounds good.\nLeonard: Should we call Howard and Bernadette?\nRaj: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what time their plane gets in, but let me, let me shoot them a text.\nAmy: Did he say anything about the funeral?\nRaj: Not much, but he seemed to be in a pretty good place.\nScene: An airport baggage desk.\nHoward: Are you kidding me? You lost my mother\xe2\x80\x99s ashes?\nBaggage Clerk: No, I\xe2\x80\x99m just saying that sometimes bags are misrouted.\nHoward: All right, fine. Where did you misroute the only woman who ever loved me? The first, well,\nfirst, I meant first.\nClerk: I just need some information. Uh, what\xe2\x80\x99s the flight number?\nBernadette: Eight sixteen.\nHoward: I really did mean first.\nBernadette: Just drop it.\nClerk: And can you describe the bag?\nBernadette: Um, well, it\xe2\x80\x99s, uh, black. There\xe2\x80\x99s a red ribbon tied to the handle.\nHoward: The world\xe2\x80\x99s greatest mom is in the shoe compartment.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nSheldon: You ready to begin?\nPenny: Yup. Be right there. I assume you don\xe2\x80\x99t want wine.\nSheldon: Correct. You\xe2\x80\x99re not supposed to drink alcohol when operating heavy machinery.\nPenny: What heavy machinery? Let\xe2\x80\x99s just start.\nSheldon: Well, as a Texas gentleman, I\xe2\x80\x99m inclined to say ladies first. Although, I\xe2\x80\x99m concerned that level of politeness and charm might make you fall in love with me before the test even begins. Perhaps we should flip a coin. Or if you\xe2\x80\x99re familiar with the rules of Rock, Paper, Scissors\xe2\x80\xa6\nPenny: Question one. Given the choice of anyone in the world, whom would you want as a dinner guest?\nSheldon: Hmm. Living or dead?\nPenny: Just says anyone in the world. I guess that means living.\nSheldon: Ah, that\xe2\x80\x99s just as well. As much as I\xe2\x80\x99d love to meet Euclid, inventor of the geometric proof, he probably wore sandals and I cannot look at toes during dinner. Oh, I know, the person I\xe2\x80\x99d most like to have dinner with is myself.\nPenny: You sure that\xe2\x80\x99s your choice? \xe2\x80\x98Cause I\xe2\x80\x99ve had that dinner.\nSheldon: Well, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t. And while they say never meet your heroes, I just don\xe2\x80\x99t see how I could disappoint. Who would you choose?\nPenny: Robert Downey, Jr.\nSheldon: Oh, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t think of Iron Man. You know, maybe after myself and I have dinner, we can meet you two for dessert.\nScene: Raj\xe2\x80\x99s car.\nRaj: So, what do you guys want to do?\nAmy: Well, we\xe2\x80\x99re the ones tagging along, you pick.\nEmily: Ooh, have you ever been to an escape room?\nLeonard: What\xe2\x80\x99s that?\nEmily: Um, it\xe2\x80\x99s kind of like interactive theatre, except you have to solve puzzles in a certain amount of time to get out. There\xe2\x80\x99s one downtown where they trap you in a room with a zombie.\nRaj: Oh, so kind of like what\xe2\x80\x99s happening with Penny right now.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nSheldon: What would constitute a perfect day for you?\nPenny: Uh, well, I\xe2\x80\x99d probably sleep in, do a little yoga, then lie on the beach while cute cabana boys brought me drinks and probably get a massage and then cap off the night with some dancing.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s it?\nPenny: Yeah, why?\nSheldon: You didn\xe2\x80\x99t mention Leonard.\nPenny: He\xe2\x80\x99s there.\nSheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t think so. Leonard can\xe2\x80\x99t stand yoga, the beach, massages or dancing.\nPenny: Yeah, well, he brought a book, okay? What\xe2\x80\x99s yours?\nSheldon: Uh, I wake up. Uh, I enjoy some French toast with butter and syrup. Uh, then a wormhole opens, and whisks me millions of years into the future where my towering intellect is used to save the last remnants of mankind from a predatory alien race.\nPenny: Interesting, you didn\xe2\x80\x99t mention Amy.\nSheldon: Who do you think made the French toast with butter and syrup?\nScene: An escape room.\nWoman in lab coat: You\xe2\x80\x99re about to enter the lab of the late Dr. David Saltzberg. While conducting studies on slowing the aging process, there was a catastrophic accident and he died. Or did he?\nLeonard: Ladies?\nEmily: Are you being polite or scared?\nLeonard: Yup.\nEmily: Ah, what a room!\nAmy: Oh.\nLeonard: This is cool.\nAmy: So, how do we start?\nEmily: We have to look for the clues hidden around the room.\nRaj: Uh, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t there supposed to be a zombie?\nZombie: Uuuuuuuh!\nRaj: Ooh. Okay, let\xe2\x80\x99s hope one of the clues is written on a pair of clean underwear.\nScene: The Baggage Claim.\nClerk: Mr. and Mrs. Wolowitz? As far as I can tell, your bag arrived in Los Angeles.\nBernadette: So, where is it?\nClerk: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, perhaps somebody took it off the carousel by mistake?\nHoward: So, some stranger has my mom? Is that what you\xe2\x80\x99re telling me? My poor mother can be anywhere in Los Angeles right now?\nClerk: I, I wish I was telling you that. Um, but the passenger could\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten on an international flight.\nHoward: Oh, okay, great. So, your entire job is to find lost luggage, and you\xe2\x80\x99ve narrowed down the location of my mother to the planet Earth.\nClerk: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. W, would 500 frequent-flyer miles help? That could get you to Sacramento.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nSheldon: If you could wake up tomorrow having gained any one quality or ability, what would it be?\nPenny: Well, not to steal from the Bible, but turning water into wine sounds pretty good.\nSheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you\xe2\x80\x99re taking this seriously.\nPenny: Come on, I\xe2\x80\x99m just having some fun with you.\nSheldon: I believe what you\xe2\x80\x99re doing is using humour to avoid vulnerability.\nPenny: Fine. Honestly, if I could have one quality, I wish I could be as smart as you guys.\nSheldon: Ha. Keep dreaming.\nPenny: Sheldon.\nShedon: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. That was me having fun with you. Look, you may not be as, as academically inclined as are we. Yes, that\xe2\x80\x99s how you say it. But, you possess an intelligence I envy. Which leads me to my answer. I would choose the ability to read people\xe2\x80\x99s minds.\nPenny: Well, I can\xe2\x80\x99t read people\xe2\x80\x99s minds. Actually, that\xe2\x80\x99s not true, I can read men\xe2\x80\x99s minds, but only \xe2\x80\x99cause it\xe2\x80\x99s usually the one thing.\nSheldon: When are we going to get robot eyes?\nPenny: You\xe2\x80\x99re all alike.\nSheldon: Well, what I meant was I often misinterpret how others are feeling. Like, I can\xe2\x80\x99t always tell if someone is only joking or laughing at me. You know, like, uh, if they\xe2\x80\x99re mad at something I\xe2\x80\x99ve done or just in a bad mood. It, it\xe2\x80\x99s incredibly stressful.\nPenny: Really? You always seem so confident.\nSheldon: Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not. And if I could read people\xe2\x80\x99s minds, life would be so much simpler.\nPenny: Well, now I wish I had the ability to make that stuff easier for you.\nSheldon: Thank you.\nPenny: Wow, I just felt this wave of affection for you.\nSheldon: You sure it\xe2\x80\x99s not too much Bible juice?\nPenny: And the wave is gone.\nScene: The escape room.\nZombie: Brains!\nAmy: Keep it down, we\xe2\x80\x99re working here.\nRaj: Okay, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got the cipher decoded.\nEmily: How\xe2\x80\x99s it going with the globe?\nAmy: We used the coordinates to locate the cities.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m putting the city names in the grid now. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that\xe2\x80\x99ll give us the code to the safe.\nZombie: Solve puzzle too fast! Slow down!\nLeonard: Yup. Got the code.\nZombie: Just saying, no refund for finish early!\nScene: The baggage check.\nBernadette: Sure you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to go home? When the bag\xe2\x80\x99s returned, they\xe2\x80\x99ll deliver it to us.\nHoward: No, I\xe2\x80\x99m not leaving without her.\nBernadette: All right, we\xe2\x80\x99ll wait.\nHoward: I could\xe2\x80\x99ve driven her.\nBernadette: What?\nHoward: The day she left for Florida. She asked me to drive her to the airport. I was too busy. And I made her take a cab. I was too busy.\nBernadette: There\xe2\x80\x99s no way you could\xe2\x80\x99ve known. Be right back. Excuse me?\nClerk: Yes?\nBernadette: You better find my husband\xe2\x80\x99s mother \xe2\x80\x99cause one way or another, w e\xe2\x80\x99re walking out of this airport with a dead woman.\nScene: The escape room.\nLeonard: Which book are we looking for?\nRaj: Uh, Origin of Species.\nLeonard: Here it is. There\xe2\x80\x99s a black light.\nEmily: Oh, hang on.\nRaj: Oh, okay. Uh, brothers and sisters I have none, but this man\xe2\x80\x99s father is my father\xe2\x80\x99s son. Who am I looking at? Yeah, yeah, we get it, you want brains. Calm down.\nAmy: Well, if I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a brother, my father\xe2\x80\x99s son is me. And if I\xe2\x80\x99m this man\xe2\x80\x99s father, then he\xe2\x80\x99s my son. The answer\xe2\x80\x99s son.\nEmily: Ooh. There\xe2\x80\x99s a picture of the sun over there.\nLeonard: I bet the key\xe2\x80\x99s behind it.\nZombie: Could be somewhere else.\nEmily: Oh, got the key.\nAmy: So, that\xe2\x80\x99s the key to the door? That\xe2\x80\x99s it?\nLeonard: We spent two hundred dollars on six minutes of fun?\nRaj: It\xe2\x80\x99s like when you bought that remote-controlled helicopter, and it just flew away.\nEmily: Sorry, guys. Really thought the puzzles would be better.\nAmy: Well, to be fair, we do all have advanced degrees.\nZombie: Remember that before you post on Yelp.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nPenny: If you were to die this evening with no opportunity to communicate with anyone, what would you most regret not having told someone?\nSheldon: So, it would be today? Huh. Well, I suppose there\xe2\x80\x99s something satisfying about dying on my birthday.\nPenny: Today\xe2\x80\x99s your birthday?\nSheldon: Yes.\nPenny: Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s always been a secret. Not even Amy knows.\nSheldon: Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t enjoy presents. And the thought of people jumping out and yelling surprise fills me with more dread than the words George Lucas Director\xe2\x80\x99s Cut.\nPenny: So, why did you finally tell me?\nSheldon: The point of the experiment is to be completely honest with each other.\nPenny: Well, thank you for sharing it with me. I won\xe2\x80\x99t tell anyone.\nSheldon: Thank you.\nPenny: That is so funny. I never would have pegged you for a Pisces.\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re making it difficult to love you right now.\nScene: The baggage check.\nClerk: Great news, your bag was returned.\nHoward: Oh, thank God. It\xe2\x80\x99s okay, she\xe2\x80\x99s here. Ma\xe2\x80\x99s here.\nBernadette: Okay, thank you so much.\nHoward: Ma? I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry I didn\xe2\x80\x99t take you to the airport. I just want you to know that I\xe2\x80\x99ll never forgive myself for being so selfish. And I promise to keep you close for the rest of my life.\nBernadette: Oh, no. That thing\xe2\x80\x99s gonna end up in my bedroom.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s it. We\xe2\x80\x99re done with the questions.\nPenny: All that\xe2\x80\x99s left to do is stare into each other\xe2\x80\x99s eyes for four minutes without talking.\nSheldon: Okay. Wait, hang on. Bladder check. We\xe2\x80\x99re good to go.\nPenny: You ready?\nSheldon: Yes.\nPenny: And begin. This is kind of creepy.\nSheldon: We\xe2\x80\x99re not supposed to talk during this part.\nPenny: Sorry.\nSheldon: This is kind of creepy.\nPenny: Do you want to stop? I know you have trouble with eye contact.\nSheldon: Well, you have a brown fleck in your right iris that looks like a Formula One race car. So I\xe2\x80\x99m just concentrating on that. Plus, it\xe2\x80\x99s easier around people that I\xe2\x80\x99m comfortable with.\nPenny: Aw, sweetie, I\xe2\x80\x99m comfortable around you, too.\nSheldon: Of course you are, I\xe2\x80\x99m warm and soothing. I\xe2\x80\x99m like a human bowl of tomato soup.\nPenny: I meant more like a little brother.\nSheldon: Oh. Well, I suppose I do think of you as a sister. And sometimes, a mother.\nPenny: It\xe2\x80\x99s getting creepy again.\nSheldon: What?\nPenny: Just thinking about the day I met you and Leonard.\nSheldon: It was a Monday afternoon. You joined us for Indian food.\nPenny: Can you believe it\xe2\x80\x99s been eight years?\nSheldon: Yeah, and you\xe2\x80\x99re still eating our food.\nPenny: I can\xe2\x80\x99t remember a time you guys weren\xe2\x80\x99t in my life.\nSheldon: I remember it perfectly. But I have an eidetic memory. If you\xe2\x80\x99re interested, I also remember how much you owe us for the food.\nPenny: That\xe2\x80\x99s it. That wasn\xe2\x80\x99t so bad.\nSheldon: No, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t. Uh, now let\xe2\x80\x99s tabulate the results of the experiment. I think it\xe2\x80\x99s safe to say that you\xe2\x80\x99re not in love with me and I\xe2\x80\x99m not in love with you. And psychology has once again proved itself the doofus of the sciences.\nPenny: Well, maybe. But I\xe2\x80\x99m still glad we did it. I do feel closer to you.\nSheldon: And I, you. And yes, that\xe2\x80\x99s how you say that. Yeah, so, given our newfound intimacy, I\xe2\x80\x99d say we have some hard choices to make.\nPenny: Like what?\nSheldon: Gary Con, do we fly or drive? Do we wear costumes? And if so, who gets to be Gary?\nScene: The hallway.\nSheldon: Thank you for walking me home.\nPenny: I just want to make sure you get there safe.\nSheldon: Well, this is me. It\xe2\x80\x99s been a very interesting evening.\nPenny: It really has.\nAll: SURPRISE!\nSheldon: Aah! And after I let you be Gary.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
