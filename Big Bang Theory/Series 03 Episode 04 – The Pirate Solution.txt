b'Scene: The apartment.\nSheldon: This movie baffles me every time we watch it.\nLeonard: What do you mean?\nSheldon: Well, the instructions are very clear, don\xe2\x80\x99t feed the gremlins after midnight, don\xe2\x80\x99t get the gremlins wet. How hard is that?\nPenny (arriving): Hi, guys. Hi, honey.\nLeonard: Hey.\nHoward: Ooh, we\xe2\x80\x99re honey now, are we?\nSheldon: Yes. Since their relationship became carnal, Penny has upgraded his designated term of endearment, thus distinguishing him from those she calls sweetie, usually in an attempt to soften a thinly-veiled insult.\nPenny: You\xe2\x80\x99re boring people sweetie.\nSheldon: Although, sometimes, she omits the veil entirely.\nPenny: So, what are you guys doing?\nHoward: Celebrating Columbus Day.\nLeonard: We\xe2\x80\x99re watching Goonies, Gremlins and Young Sherlock Holmes. They were all written by Chris Columbus.\nPenny: Okay. What do you watch on Thanksgiving?\nSheldon: The parade.\nPenny: Oh, you know, that reminds me, I usually go back to Nebraska for thanksgiving, but this year they\xe2\x80\x99re calling it off on account of my brother\xe2\x80\x99s trial.\nLeonard: What\xe2\x80\x99s he on trial for?\nPenny: Oh, just a big misunderstanding. You know, you\xe2\x80\x99d actually like my brother, he\xe2\x80\x99s kind of a chemist. Anyway, I was thinking I\xe2\x80\x99d have thanksgiving here, and you are all invited.\nLeonard: Oh. I\xe2\x80\x99ll be there.\nSheldon: Will you be serving cranberry jelly or cranberry sauce?\nPenny: I guess I could serve both.\nSheldon: You guess? You don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to have much of a handle on this.\nHoward: Yeah, I really wish I could, Penny, but every year my mother has all the relatives over and cooks up her famous tur-briska-fil.\nPenny: Tur-briska-fil?\nHoward: Turkey stuffed with a brisket stuffed with gefilte fish. It\xe2\x80\x99s not as good as it sounds.\nPenny: Raj, what about you?\nHoward: Oh, he usually comes to my house. Right, pal? (Raj bursts into tears and runs away) All right, this year, you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to eat the tur-briska-fil. I don\xe2\x80\x99t even chew it. I swallow it like pills.\nCredits sequence.\n  Scene: A few moments later.\nLeonard: So, what\xe2\x80\x99s going on with Raj?\nHoward: Well, the good news is, he has no problem with my mother\xe2\x80\x99s tur-brka-fil.\nPenny: Hard to believe, but go on.\nHoward: The bad news is, he says he\xe2\x80\x99s getting deported.\nLeonard: What do you mean, he\xe2\x80\x99s getting deported?\nSheldon: I believe it means that the U.S. Government is going to expel him from the country. He could then either return to his native India, emigrate to another country that\xe2\x80\x99s willing to accept him, or wander the high seas as a stateless pirate. Personally, I\xe2\x80\x99d choose pirate.\nHoward: Penny, would you mind stepping outside so we can speak to him?\nPenny: Ugh, fine. But the man really needs to work on his girl issues.\nSheldon: Another reason to consider a life of piracy. Even today, I understand that\xe2\x80\x99s an all-male profession.\nHoward: Okay, she\xe2\x80\x99s gone.\nRaj: Sorry. I lost my cool.\nLeonard: So, what\xe2\x80\x99s going on?\nRaj: Okay, here\xe2\x80\x99s the deal, six months ago, my research testing the predicted composition of trans-Neptunian objects ran into a dead end.\nHoward: So?\nRaj: So, my visa\xe2\x80\x99s only good as long as I\xe2\x80\x99m employed at the university, and when they find out I\xe2\x80\x99ve got squat, they\xe2\x80\x99re going to cut me off. By the way, when I say squat, I mean diddly-squat. I wish I had squat.\nLeonard: So, wait, what have you been doing for the past six months?\nRaj: You know, checking e-mail, updating my facebook status, messing up wikipedia entries. Hey, did you know Netflix lets you stream movies on your computer now?\nSheldon: And you\xe2\x80\x99ve continued to take the university\xe2\x80\x99s money under false pretences? Highly unethical for an astrophysicist. Although practically mandatory for a pirate.\nRaj: I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to go back to India. It\xe2\x80\x99s hot and loud, and there\xe2\x80\x99s so many people. You have no idea, they\xe2\x80\x99re everywhere.\nHoward: Okay, guys, think, how do we keep Raj in the country?\nPenny (from outside): Why doesn\xe2\x80\x99t he just get another job?\nHoward (after Raj whispers to him): What are you asking me for? I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if you can talk now or not.\nScene: The university cafeteria.\nRaj: Oh, beef, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to miss you so much. Do you know, at the Mumbai McDonald\xe2\x80\x99s, you can\xe2\x80\x99t get a Big Mac? All you can get is a Chicken Maharaja Mac. And the special sauce, curry, which, in India,\nbelieve you me, is really not that special.\nLeonard: Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry, you\xe2\x80\x99ll find another job.\nRaj: Yeah let me start practicing for it. Do you want fries with that Maharaja Mac?\xe2\x80\x9d\nSheldon: Hi, Leonard. Hello, Raj.\nRaj: Hello Sheldon.\nSheldon: Forgive me, as you know, I\xe2\x80\x99m no adept at reading facial cues, but I\xe2\x80\x99m going to take a stab here, you\xe2\x80\x99re either sad or nauseated.\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99m sad.\nSheldon: I was going to say sad. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why I hedged.\nRaj: What are you eating?\nSheldon: Elbow macaroni with ground hamburger and tomato sauce.\nRaj: Oh, beefaroni. I think I\xe2\x80\x99ll miss you most of all.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99ve always been a little confused about this. Why don\xe2\x80\x99t Hindus eat beef?\nRaj: We believe cows are gods.\nSheldon: Not technically. In Hinduism, cattle are thought to be like God.\nRaj: Do not tell me about my own culture, Sheldon! In the mood I\xe2\x80\x99m in, I\xe2\x80\x99ll take you out, I swear to cow!\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.\nRaj: Me, too. I\xe2\x80\x99m just, I\xe2\x80\x99m a little on edge.\nSheldon: Understandable. Your entire life seems to be crumbling around you, and your future appears bleak at best.\nRaj: Thank you.\nSheldon: And you\xe2\x80\x99re wrong about Hinduism and cows.\nHoward (arriving): Hey, Raj, guess what. Professor Laughlin is looking for someone to join the stellar evolution research team.\nRaj: You, you\xe2\x80\x99re kidding. That\xe2\x80\x99s fantastic!\nHoward: Come on, what are you waiting for? Call him and set up an interview.\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99m on it.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s happy, right?\nLeonard: Yeah.\nSheldon: Nailed it.\nScene: Professor Laughlin\xe2\x80\x99s office.\nProf Laughlin: Dr. Koothrappali, come on in. I was surprised to hear you were interested In joining our little team. Giving up on those trans-Neptunian objects, are we?\nRaj: No, no, it\xe2\x80\x99s a very promising area. In a perfect world I\xe2\x80\x99d spend several more years on it. But I just couldn\xe2\x80\x99t pass up the opportunity to work with you on your tremendously exciting and not yet conclusively disproved hypothesis.\nProf Laughlin: Splendid. Uh, please sit down. Can I offer you a sherry?\nRaj: It\xe2\x80\x99s a little early, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\nProf Laughlin: Not on Proxima Centauri.\nRaj: That\xe2\x80\x99s very good. Jolly amusing, but if you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind, I\xe2\x80\x99ll hold off until sunset on titan.\nProf Laughlin: Oh, well done. I have a feeling you\xe2\x80\x99re going to fit in just fine, Dr. Koothrappali.\nRaj: Thank you, sir. (There is a knock on the door. A young woman enters)\nWoman: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. Am I late?\nProf Laughlin: No, no, no. Right on time. Dr. Koothrappali, may I present Dr. Millstone from MIT. She\xe2\x80\x99ll be heading up our data analysis team.\nDr Millstone: It\xe2\x80\x99s nice to meet you, Dr. Koothrappali. I read your paper on Kuiper belt object size distribution. I really enjoyed it. How did you correct for the selection bias? (During this, Raj surreptitiously wanders over to where Prof Laughlin\xe2\x80\x99s drinks are, pours himself a large sherry and knocks it back in one.)\nRaj: Well, I ran a simulation that allowed me to correct for the observational efficiency.\nDr Millstone: That\xe2\x80\x99s just fascinating.\nRaj: Thank you. Would you like to hear more about it in my hot tub? So, when do I start?\nScene: The apartment.\nHoward: What do you mean you didn\xe2\x80\x99t get the job? How could you not get it?\nRaj: You know, he\xe2\x80\x99s British, I\xe2\x80\x99m Indian, ever since Gandhi they haven\xe2\x80\x99t liked us very much.\nLeonard: Wait, are you saying that he discriminated against you? Because we should file a complaint.\nRaj: That\xe2\x80\x99s okay. A complaint has been filed. So, that\xe2\x80\x99s it. That was my last hope. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to be deported, sent home in disgrace, exposed to the sardonic barbs of my cousin Sanjay. Or, as you may know him, Dave from AT&T customer service.\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m really going to miss you.\nRaj: Will you come visit me in India?\nHoward: Gee, that\xe2\x80\x99s, like, a 17-hour flight. How about I meet you halfway?\nRaj: Halfway is 600 miles off the coast of Japan.\nHoward: Tell you what, we\xe2\x80\x99ll skype.\nSheldon (arriving): Gentlemen.\nLeonard: Hey.\nSheldon: Raj, did you get the job with Professor Laughlin?\nRaj: No.\nSheldon: I assumed as much. But never fear. Like the subordinate male protagonist in countless action movies who disappears half way through the second reel, I have returned to save the day. Odd, usually, he\xe2\x80\x99s met by cheers. Anyway, I was thinking about exploring the string theory implications of gamma rays from dark matter annihilations, and it occurred to me that I could benefit\xe2\x80\xa6\nLeonard: Excuse me, Sheldon, how many reels before the subordinate male protagonist gets to his point?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, if you didn\xe2\x80\x99t cheer at my entrance, it\xe2\x80\x99s too late to buy into the premise. Anyway, I got some extra money from the head of the department, and raj can come work for me.\nRaj: You want me to work with you?\nSheldon: For me. You\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to listen more carefully when you\xe2\x80\x99re on the job.\nRaj: Okay, uh, please don\xe2\x80\x99t take this the wrong way, but I\xe2\x80\x99d rather swim buck-naked across the Ganges with a paper cut on my nipple and die a slow, agonizing death from a viral infection than work with you.\nSheldon: For me.\nScene: Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s office.\nRaj (knocking and entering): Sheldon, are you busy?\nSheldon: Of course I\xe2\x80\x99m busy.\nRaj: Shall I wait?\nSheldon: Yes, please. (After about 30 seconds) How may I help you?\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99ve reconsidered your offer to let me work with you.\nSheldon: For me.\nRaj: Yes, for you. I do, however, have a few conditions. First, at all times, I am to be treated as a colleague and an equal. Second, my contributions shall be noted in all published material. And third, you are never allowed to lecture me on Hinduism or my Indian culture.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m impressed, Raj. Those are very cogent and reasonable conditions.\nRaj: Thank you.\nSheldon: I reject them all.\nRaj: Then you leave me no choice. I accept the job.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, I believe you\xe2\x80\x99ve misunderstood. I\xe2\x80\x99m not giving you the job. I\xe2\x80\x99m simply affording you the opportunity to apply for it. Have a seat, we\xe2\x80\x99ll get started with the interview.\nRaj: Wha\xe2\x80\xa6 You\xe2\x80\x99re kidding!\nSheldon: Please.\nRaj: All right.\nSheldon: So, that\xe2\x80\x99s what you wear to an interview?\nRaj: Come on, dude, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been friends for years.\nSheldon: Oh, pulling strings, are we?\nRaj: Sheldon, for God\xe2\x80\x99s sakes, don\xe2\x80\x99t make me beg.\nSheldon: Bazinga! You\xe2\x80\x99ve fallen victim to another one of my classic practical jokes. I\xe2\x80\x99m your boss now. You may want to laugh at that.\nScene: The apartment.\nPenny: Ah, it\xe2\x80\x99s nice having the place to ourselves, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\nLeonard: Uh-huh. Now that Raj is working for Sheldon, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have to chauffeur him around anymore. Plus, yeah, with them working late so much, we get some privacy.\nPenny: Mm-hmm. Hey, want to get a little crazy?\nLeonard: What are you thinking?\nPenny: Let\xe2\x80\x99s slide over to Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s spot a make out.\nLeonard: You are a dirty girl.\nPenny (as the making out is interrupted by a knock on the door): Oh, God, how did he know?\nHoward: Hello.\nLeonard: Hi, Howard.\nHoward: Am I interrupting?\nLeonard: Little bit, yeah.\nHoward: Guess I should have called.\nPenny: Yeah, maybe.\nHoward: Tonight\xe2\x80\x99s the night I usually go line dancing with Raj at the palomino.\nLeonard: Uh-huh.\nHoward: But he\xe2\x80\x99s working with Sheldon.\nPenny: Yes, we know.\nHoward: Want me to leave?\nLeonard: You know, whatever.\nHoward: Okay, I guess I can hang for a little while. So what are we watching? Sex and the city.\nYikes.\nPenny: Hey, I happen to love this movie.\nHoward: Fine, let\xe2\x80\x99s watch it. Maybe all our periods will synchronize.\nScene: Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s office.\nSheldon: All right, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be designing an experiment to look for the annihilation spectrum resulting from dark matter collisions in space.\nRaj: Ooh, dark matter. We better bring a flashlight. I was making a joke.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m the boss. I make the jokes.\nRaj: Sorry, go ahead and make your joke.\nSheldon: This is not the time for joking. We\xe2\x80\x99re doing serious research, which requires complete and utter focus.\nRaj: All right, let\xe2\x80\x99s buckle down and work.\n(To the tune of Eye of the Tiger by Survivor, there is a montage of images, in all of which Sheldon and Raj are staring at the same equation on a whiteboard.)\nRaj: Sheldon.\nSheldon: What?\nRaj: I need an aspirin.\nSheldon: Top desk drawer.\nRaj: Thank you.\nSheldon: Alright?\nRaj: Yes.\nSheldon: Good.\n(Montage of scenes resumes)\n  Scene: Penny and Leonard exiting Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom.\nLeonard: That was fun. Thank you.\nPenny: Leonard, honey, you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to say thank you every time we have sex.\nLeonard: Oh. Okay. Tomorrow you\xe2\x80\x99re going to get a card in the mail. Just throw it away.\nHoward: Top o\xe2\x80\x99 the mornin\xe2\x80\x99o ya!\nLeonard: What are you doing here?\nHoward: Well, usually, on Sundays, I go with Raj to scam on hippie chicks at the farmers market, but he\xe2\x80\x99s still working with Sheldon, so I thought I\xe2\x80\x99d come over here and make you guys scrambled eggs and salami. It\xe2\x80\x99s the perfect meal for apres l\xe2\x80\x99amour.\nPenny: Oh, kill me.\nHoward: By the way, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help overhearing your big finish. Bravo, Leonard.\nPenny: See, if you had killed me when I said kill me, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have had to hear that.\nHoward: What do you guys think? Want to take in a matinee, maybe go rollerblading, catch a step class?\nPenny: Do something.\nLeonard: Yeah, okay. Um, Howard, we need to talk.\nHoward: Sure. \xe2\x80\x98sup, homes?\nLeonard: Uh, please understand that it\xe2\x80\x99s not that we don\xe2\x80\x99t want you around, but Penny and I occasionally need some alone time.\nHoward: Oh. I get it, I\xe2\x80\x99m the third wheel. Sorry, I should have seen that. I\xe2\x80\x99ll get out of your way. Uh, you\xe2\x80\x99re gonna want to eat those eggs while they\xe2\x80\x99re still hot.\nLeonard: Thank you. There\xe2\x80\x99s lox and cream cheese in the fridge, the bagels are in the oven, I was warming them up.\nPenny: That\xe2\x80\x99s great.\nHoward: Ill just hang out with my mom. That\xe2\x80\x99s always fun.\nLeonard: Good.\nPenny: Are we terrible people?\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. What do you want me to do?\nPenny: Get him, bring him back.\nLeonard: Are you sure?\nPenny: Yeah.\nLeonard: Okay. Howard come back.\nHoward: Oh, you guys had me scared for a minute.\nScene: Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s office. Sheldon is writing on the whiteboard.\n  Raj: No, no, no, no! That rate is much too low for what we\xe2\x80\x99d expect from this collision. Do you understand that we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about dark matter colliding in outer space?\nSheldon: Of course I understand. And who are you to tell me about outer space?\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99m the astrophysicist. Astro means space.\nSheldon: Astro means star.\nRaj: Okay, well, let me just tell you, if we were having this argument in my native language, I\xe2\x80\x99d be kicking your butt.\nSheldon: English is your native language.\nRaj: Okay, you got me there, but you\xe2\x80\x99re wrong about this!\nSheldon: There is a fine line between wrong and visionary. Unfortunately you have to be a visionary to see it.\nRaj: My god, you think that every thought that comes out of your head is pure gold. Well, let me tell you something. Some of those thoughts are pure caca.\nSheldon: Caca?\nRaj: It means doo-doo.\nSheldon: All right! First of all, Dr. Koothrappali, when I first proposed that you work with me\xe2\x80\xa6\nRaj: Aha! So I am working with you.\nSheldon: In this context, with me means for me.\nRaj: Ah, well, in this context\xe2\x80\xa6 (blows raspberry)\nSheldon: Oh! If I\xe2\x80\x99m wrong, prove it.\nRaj: Okay. Here\xe2\x80\x99s where we derive the mass of the dark matter particle.\nSheldon: No, no, no, you\xe2\x80\x99ve misstated the atomic weight of the target.\nRaj: Let me finish.\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re defacing my work.\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99m not defacing it, I\xe2\x80\x99m fixing it.\nSheldon: Give me the eraser.\nRaj: No.\nSheldon: I said give it to me.\nRaj: Come and get it.\nSheldon: Fine. (Uses hand as an eraser. Then realises his hand is dirty) Oh, lord. Dr. Koothrappali, as your superior, I forbid you from writing on my board!\nRaj: You are not my superior.\nSheldon: I am in every way.\nRaj: Oh, yeah? Can you do this? (Performs  complex finger trick*) Nice working with you. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, for you. (Exits. Sheldon stares a moment, then tries to perform the trick. Fails.)\nScene: Outside Raj\xe2\x80\x99s flat.\n  Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Raj. (Knock, knock, knock) Raj. (Knock, knock, knock) Raj.\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99m busy.\nSheldon: Doing what? (Performs finger trick again) All right, you\xe2\x80\x99ve made your point.\nRaj: What do you want, Sheldon?\nSheldon: I looked over the board and it turns out you were right.\nRaj: So you were wrong.\nSheldon: I didn\xe2\x80\x99t say that.\nRaj: That\xe2\x80\x99s the only logical inference.\nSheldon: Nevertheless, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t say it. Anyway, I would like you to come back and work for me.\nRaj: For you or with you?\nSheldon: In this context for me could mean with me.\nRaj: All right, but I have some conditions.\nSheldon: I reject them all.\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99ll take the job. See you Monday.\nSheldon: Wait, you have to drive me home.\nRaj: How did you get here?\nSheldon: I walked.\nRaj: So walk home.\nSheldon: I can\xe2\x80\x99t. There\xe2\x80\x99s a big dog outside. On the way home, we can start thinking about methods of optimizing the detector for 500 GEV particles.\nRaj: All right. (As they walk down the corridor, Eye of the Tiger starts playing again.)\n(* to perform trick, place both hands together as if praying, then fold two middle fingers over so that they pass to the right of one another, finally rotate right hand anti-clockwise and waggle both middle fingers)\nAdvertisements'
