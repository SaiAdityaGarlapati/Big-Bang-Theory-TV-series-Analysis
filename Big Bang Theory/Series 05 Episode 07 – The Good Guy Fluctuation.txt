b'Scene: Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s office.\nSheldon: And reverse the spin on the antiproton, and gamma becomes alpha, multiplied by a matrix of negative I comma zero, and there we have it. Conclusive proof that I am absolutely worthless after nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\nGhostly voice: Sheldon, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Hmm. (Looks outside office door. Corridor lamp sparks and goes out. Corridor is bathed in an eerie glow) All right, all right. I see what\xe2\x80\x99s going on. A little pre-Halloween hijinkery. A ghostly moan, a rattling of chains, a witch\xe2\x80\x99s cackle. The trifecta of haunted house clich\xc3\xa9s. Instead of eek, I say yawn.\nGhostly voice: Sheldon.\nSheldon: Oh, the walls are dripping blood, which looks nothing like a phenolphthalein indicator exposed to a sodium carbonate solution. (Reading message on wall) See you in hell Sheldon. The most frightening thing about that is the missing comma. (A luminous skeleton rushes towards him) Ah. Okay, all right. That one was clever. Skeleton with phosphorous on a zip line. Come on out, merry pranksters. Take a bow.\nRaj: You should\xe2\x80\x99ve seen your face.\nSheldon: Yes, there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing quite like the slightly widened eyes of mildly startled.\nHoward: Come on, admit it. We got you, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Please, fright depends on an element of surprise. The simple fact is, because I am much smarter than you, and able to anticipate your actions, it is highly unlikely that you two rubes could ever surprise me. (Leonard creeps out behind him wearing a Star Trek Balok mask)\nRaj: He\xe2\x80\x99s probably right.\nHoward: We can\xe2\x80\x99t beat him. He\xe2\x80\x99s just too smart.\nSheldon: Gentlemen. (Turns and sees Leonard. Screams and faints).\nHoward: Who had money on faints?\nRaj: I had pee his pants.\nLeonard: Hang on. Looks like everyone\xe2\x80\x99s a winner.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The comic book store.\nLeonard: Oh. Watch out, Sheldon. This little boy Casper is a g-g-g-ghost!\nSheldon: Droll.\nHoward:Not as droll as a grown man passed out in a puddle of his own urine.\nLeonard: That was pretty droll. With a hint of ammonia.\nSheldon: Yes, enjoy your japes, gentlemen. You think you\xe2\x80\x99ve poked fun at a milquetoast academic. Well, you\xe2\x80\x99ve forgotten one thing. I am also a son of the Lone Star state. I\xe2\x80\x99m Texas through and through. And we know how to settle scores down there. If you doubt me, ask Mexico.\nStuart: Hot girl, nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock. Don\xe2\x80\x99t everybody look at once!\nRaj: What is she doing in a comic book store?\nStuart: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, she might be lost. Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter. Watch and learn. Hi.\nHot girl: Hi.\nStuart: Um\xe2\x80\xa6 it-it-it\xe2\x80\xa6 (returns to guys) Shut up.\nHot girl (to Leonard): Are you getting this Next Men?\nLeonard: Uh, yeah. It\xe2\x80\x99s issue number 21. First appearance of Hellboy.\nHot girl: I know. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been looking for it for years.\nLeonard: Sorry.\nHot girl: Hey, if I pretended to hit on you, could I distract you enough to sneak it away?\nLeonard: Yes, but you\xe2\x80\x99d be using your superpowers for evil.\nHot girl: Damn, I\xe2\x80\x99m forbidden by my Kryptonian father to do so. I am Alice.\nLeonard: Leonard.\nAlice: You are very cute, Leonard.\nLeonard: Thanks. You, too. You know, go ahead and take it.\nAlice: No, no. No, no, I, I, I did evil. Would you be open to a trade?\nLeonard: Uh, yeah, yeah, sure, I guess.\nAlice: Okay. Here. This is my number, call me.\nLeonard: Sorry, palm\xe2\x80\x99s a little sweaty. What\xe2\x80\x99s that word?\nAlice: Alice.\nLeonard: Oh, right, your name. That makes more sense than penis.\nAlice: Later.\nHoward: Did we just see you pick up a girl in a comic book store?\nStuart: \xe2\x80\x98Cause if you did, you get your picture up there on the Wall of Heroes.\nLeonard: No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I picked her up. Besides, I have a girlfriend.\nStuart: Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter. This is the closest anyone\xe2\x80\x99s ever come. You\xe2\x80\x99re going on the wall, my friend.\nScene: Entering the apartment building.\nSheldon: Be sure to check the mail.\nLeonard: How many times are you gonna tell me? What\xe2\x80\x99s with you?\nSheldon: Nothing. It\xe2\x80\x99s not suspicious that I\xe2\x80\x99m fixating. It\xe2\x80\x99s consistent with my personality.\nLeonard: Right.\nPenny: Hey, guys.\nLeonard: More Halloween candy? Didn\xe2\x80\x99t you just buy a bunch of it yesterday?\nPenny: Oh. Yeah. That\xe2\x80\x99s gone. It\xe2\x80\x99s a rough month when Halloween and PMS hit at the same time.\nSheldon: Leonard doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have time to chat, he has to get the mail.\nLeonard: Will you relax? I\xe2\x80\x99ll get it in a minute. Hey, how was work?\nSheldon: Open the mail!\nLeonard: Excuse me. (Sheldon holds fingers in ears) A couple of circulars, nothing important.\nPenny: What\xe2\x80\x99s with him?\nLeonard: Hang on. (Sheldon opens mail box. A loud horn blows and a balloon with Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s face on pops out. Sheldon faints again.) You might be from Texas, but I\xe2\x80\x99m from New Jersey.\nScene: The apartment. Leonard is with Alice.\nLeonard: Check it out. Jim Lee drew this of me two years ago at Comic Con.\nAlice: What are you wearing?\nLeonard: Well, you know, it\xe2\x80\x99s Comic Con. I\xe2\x80\x99m Lion-O from ThunderCats.\nAlice: Wow, you must have gotten so laid.\nLeonard: No. But Jessica Alba did rub my furry belly.\nAlice: Want to see a comic I draw?\nLeonard: You\xe2\x80\x99re kidding. You have your own book?\nAlice: Yeah. It\xe2\x80\x99s kinda based on my life.\nLeonard: Cool. Oh, look. That\xe2\x80\x99s you having sex with a guy in the top half of a Chewbacca costume. Comic Con?\nAlice: You\xe2\x80\x99d think, but no.\nLeonard: You\xe2\x80\x99re very talented. This is really good. Did you do\xe2\x80\xa6 (she kisses him.)\nAlice: So, can I trade you my comic for the Hellboy?\nLeonard: You can have my car.\nScene: Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s office.\nSheldon (creeps into office carrying a box): Oh, dear. (Reaches into box, picks up a snake) Oh, dear. (Puts snake into Raj\xe2\x80\x99s top drawer) Oh, dear, oh, dear. Oh, dear, oh, dear. Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Purell, Purell, Purell, Purell.\nRaj (entering): Good morning, Sheldon.\nSheldon: It is, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? Oh, bother. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that just always the way? You go to staple something, and you\xe2\x80\x99re out of staples. Gosh, I wish I\xe2\x80\x99d known that earlier today when I was at Staples.\nRaj: You have a thing of paper clips right there.\nSheldon: well, no, no, I need something more permanent to join these papers. Say, don\xe2\x80\x99t you keep staples in your top desk drawer?\nRaj: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Maybe.\nSheldon: Be a lamb and check.\nRaj: All right. (Opening drawer) Who do we have here?\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s a snake. A terrifying snake.\nRaj: Oh, did some bad man put us in a drawer?\nSheldon: Stop talking like that. You\xe2\x80\x99ve been rendered speechless by fear.\nRaj: Let\xe2\x80\x99s go to the biology lab and find you some nice yummy mice.\nSheldon: I tried to scare an Indian with a snake. Come on, Cooper. You\xe2\x80\x99re better than this.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment. There is a knock.\nPenny: It\xe2\x80\x99s open.\nLeonard: Hey, you got a minute?\nPenny: Yeah, sure, come on in.\nLeonard: Thanks.\nPenny: Want some mac and cheese?\nLeonard: No. Lactose. Gas.\nPenny: Glass of wine?\nLeonard: No. Sulfites. Migraines.\nPenny: Okay, well, I\xe2\x80\x99d offer you Halloween candy, but that\xe2\x80\x99s gone. So, what\xe2\x80\x99s up?\nLeonard: Okay, we used to go out, right?\nPenny: Oh, my God, that\xe2\x80\x99s where I know you from.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m dealing with a situation and it\xe2\x80\x99s kind of about my love life, so I know that might be weird for us to talk about, but in this area, as you know, all my other friends are just so stupid.\nPenny: All right, what\xe2\x80\x99s going on?\nLeonard: So, you\xe2\x80\x99re okay talking about this?\nPenny: Yes.\nLeonard: You\xe2\x80\x99re sure it\xe2\x80\x99s not weird.\nPenny: It\xe2\x80\x99s okay.\nLeonard: You know what, if you ever want to talk to me about a problem in your life with a guy, then I would be fine with that.\nPenny: Okay, good, because there\xe2\x80\x99s this one guy I used to date who\xe2\x80\x99s about to be force-fed wine and cheese if he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get to the point.\nLeonard: Okay, uh, here it is. Is it cheating if a guy has a girlfriend\xe2\x80\xa6\nPenny: Yeah, probably.\nLeonard: Come on.\nPenny: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, go ahead.\nLeonard: I met this girl, and she\xe2\x80\x99s great. We have a lot in common.\nPenny: Did you guys do it?\nLeonard: No. We just made out a little.\nPenny: Oh, look at you, you bad boy. Did you tell her about Priya?\nLeonard: Well, I was gonna, but there were too many tongues in my mouth.\nPenny: That\xe2\x80\x99s gross.\nLeonard: Here\xe2\x80\x99s the thing, I, I\xe2\x80\x99m not one of those guys who sneaks around and sleeps with more than one woman.\nPenny: Well, good for you.\nLeonard: The problem is, I want to be one of those guys.\nPenny: So sleep with the new girl and lie to Priya.\nLeonard: Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s not who I am.\nPenny: All right, then break it off with the new girl.\nLeonard: Now, let\xe2\x80\x99s not do anything rash. She\xe2\x80\x99s really hot.\nPenny: If you like this girl so much, why don\xe2\x80\x99t you just end things with Priya?\nLeonard: Priya and I are in love. I think we could get married someday.\nPenny: Leonard, you\xe2\x80\x99re looking for a way to sleep with both women and have everybody be happy about it.\nLeonard: Now we\xe2\x80\x99re getting somewhere.\nPenny: What does your gut tell you?\nLeonard: Go ask Penny; she\xe2\x80\x99ll know what to do.\nScene: The apartment. Sheldon is adjusting a device on his arm.\nSheldon: Hello, Howard. I\xe2\x80\x99ve realized that you scaring me was all in jest. Allow me to say, job well done. (Grabs his own hand. Electrocutes himself.) Perfect.\nLeonard: What are you doing?\nSheldon: Science. You wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t understand.\nLeonard: Hey, well, see you. I\xe2\x80\x99m going out. (Starts to go out. Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t.)\nSheldon: I thought you were leaving the apartment.\nLeonard: Yeah, me, too. I can\xe2\x80\x99t make up my mind.\nSheldon: Are you concerned because the world is filled with big dogs and bullies?\nLeonard: No. I\xe2\x80\x99m having a moral crisis.\nSheldon: Well, if it\xe2\x80\x99s of any help, I\xe2\x80\x99ve read all the great moral philosophers, including Dr. Seuss.\nLeonard: Oh, what the hell. I\xe2\x80\x99m supposed to go see that girl from the comic book store, Alice, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if I should, because I\xe2\x80\x99m going out with Priya, but she\xe2\x80\x99s in India.\nSheldon: All right. So the topic at hand is sexual fidelity. Probably won\xe2\x80\x99t be relying on Seuss here. Although One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish might be surprisingly applicable. Go on.\nLeonard: Well, they say at the end of your life, you regret the stuff you didn\xe2\x80\x99t do more than the stuff that you did, and I\xe2\x80\x99m pretty sure Alice is the stuff I want to do.\nSheldon: You know, the German philosopher, Friedrich Nietzsche, believed that morality is just a fiction used by the herd of inferior human beings to hold back the few superior men.\nLeonard: That actually does help.\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s worth noting that he died of syphilis.\nLeonard: Screw it, I\xe2\x80\x99m going.\nSheldon: On your way home, will you pick up some orange juice?\nLeonard: Do you mind? I\xe2\x80\x99m questioning a lot of things in my life right now.\nSheldon: Is one of those things your fondness for orange juice?\nLeonard: No.\nSheldon: Great. Tropicana, no pulp.\nScene: Howard\xe2\x80\x99s house. Sheldon rings the doorbell.\nHoward: Hey, Sheldon.\nBernadette (off): Who is it?\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s me, Sheldon, Mrs. Wolowitz.\nHoward: That\xe2\x80\x99s not my mom, it\xe2\x80\x99s Bernadette.\nSheldon: Really? That\xe2\x80\x99s very unsettling.\nBernadette: Hi, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Hi.\nHoward: What\xe2\x80\x99s up?\nSheldon: It just occurred to me that I never formally congratulated you on your pending nuptials. So I hopped on the first bus and hightailed it down here to shake your hand. Put \xe2\x80\x98er there, you old so-and-so.\nHoward: Well, I, I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna see you at work in 12 hours, don\xe2\x80\x99t you think it could have waited until then?\nSheldon: Holy smoke, why didn\xe2\x80\x99t I think of that? You\xe2\x80\x99re a better man than I, Howard Wolowitz. You put \xe2\x80\x98er there, you son of a gun!\nHoward: Whatever. (Takes his hand. Starts to be electrocuted) My\xe2\x80\xa6 oh\xe2\x80\xa6 it\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\xa6 (Clutches heart and collapses)\nBernadette: Oh, my God, Howard! What did you do?\nSheldon: It was a harmless Halloween prank. Look.\nBernadette: Howard has a heart condition! You know that!\nSheldon: Well, I thought he made that up. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t hypochondria a common idiosyncrasy of Jewish people?\nBernadette: This is adrenaline, we\xe2\x80\x99re gonna have to inject it into his heart.\nSheldon: We are?\nBernadette: You are. I\xe2\x80\x99m not strong enough to get it through his chest plate, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve only got one shot.\nSheldon: Oh, no! I can\xe2\x80\x99t!\nBernadette: Hurry! We\xe2\x80\x99re running out of time!\nSheldon: Okay.\nBernadette: Just do it!\nSheldon: Oh, God! One, two, three!\nHoward: Trick or treat, bubbeleh.\nSheldon: What? No. You mean this was all a ruse? Oh, how could I be so stu\xe2\x80\xa6 (puts hand to forehead. Electrocutes himself).\nScene: Alice\xe2\x80\x99s apartment. Alice and Leonard are kissing.\nLeonard: Damn it, I can\xe2\x80\x99t. I can\xe2\x80\x99t, I can\xe2\x80\x99t do this.\nAlice: Uh, is it my tongue stud? \xe2\x80\x98Cause if that freaks you out, you\xe2\x80\x99re in for a real surprise later on.\nLeonard: No, no, no. I, I can\xe2\x80\x99t do this. Believe me, I really want to.\nAlice: But?\nLeonard: But I kind of have a girlfriend.\nAlice: Are you kidding?\nLeonard: You\xe2\x80\x99re cool with you and me just being friends, right?\nAlice: I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe this.\nLeonard: Wait, I don\xe2\x80\x99t, which part?\nAlice: I\xe2\x80\x99m so stupid. I thought for once I\xe2\x80\x99d met a good guy, but you\xe2\x80\x99re just another jackass.\nLeonard: Oh, no, no, you have it wrong. No. I, I was going to be a jackass, but I stopped myself. I stayed a good guy, so, I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna pass on the sex. But you should know, that\xe2\x80\x99s not a comment on your hotness but on my goodness. That\xe2\x80\x99s kind of my superpower. I\xe2\x80\x99m, like, Captain Good Guy.\nScene: Leonard being ejected into the corridor.\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s okay. Did the right thing. You idiot!\nScene: The apartment. Leonard is on skype.\nLeonard: Hey, Priya.\nPriya: Hey, sweetheart. How\xe2\x80\x99s it going?\nLeonard: Uh, not so good. We have to talk.\nPriya: Oh, sounds serious. What\xe2\x80\x99s up?\nLeonard: Okay, uh, here it is. I met this girl and I kissed her, and I feel terrible about it. But it\xe2\x80\x99s done, it\xe2\x80\x99s never gonna happen again. And I am so, so sorry.\nPriya: Leonard, relax. It\xe2\x80\x99s okay.\nLeonard: It is?\nPriya: Yeah, these things happen. They happen to everybody.\nLeonard: Oh, my God, you are amazing. I mean, I don\xe2\x80\x99t deserve you. Wh, what do, what do you mean everybody?\nPriya: Leonard, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know if I should tell you, but I kind of cheated on you, too.\nLeonard: Uh, kind of?\nPriya: A couple of weeks ago, I slept with my ex-boyfriend. So, I guess we both messed up a little.\nLeonard: No, no, I messed up a little. You messed up a lot.\nPriya: Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s not a competition.\nLeonard: Oh yeah, it is, and you won. I, I, I\xe2\x80\x99m, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, I have to go. I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe this.\nSheldon (leaping out of the base of the sofa): Bazinga, punk. Now we\xe2\x80\x99re even.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
