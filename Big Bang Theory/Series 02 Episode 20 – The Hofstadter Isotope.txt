b'Scene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Hu-u-u-uh\xe2\x80\xa6. Hu-u-u-uh!\nLeonard: Problem?\nSheldon: This is Thai food.\nHoward: Here we go.\nSheldon: We don\xe2\x80\x99t have Thai food on Thursday. We have pizza on Thursday.\nLeonard: Yes, but we all agreed that the third Thursday of every month would be Anything Can Happen Thursday.\nSheldon: Well apparently the news didn\xe2\x80\x99t reach my digestive system, which, when startled, has its own version of Anything Can Happen Thursday.\nHoward: Come on, the whole idea behind Anything Can Happen Thursday is to get out of this rut we\xe2\x80\x99ve been in lately.\nSheldon: Rut? I think you mean consistency. And if we\xe2\x80\x99re going to abandon that, then why even call it Thursday? Let\xe2\x80\x99s call it Quonko Day and divide it into 29 hours of 17 minutes apiece, and celebrate it by sacrificing a goat to the mighty god Ra.\nRaj: I could go for some goat.\nLeonard: Sheldon, we agreed we\xe2\x80\x99d do something different tonight.\nSheldon: All right. Let\xe2\x80\x99s go to the comic book store.\nRaj: We went to the comic book store last night.\nSheldon: Last night was Wednesday. Wednesday is comic book night. Tonight, we\xe2\x80\x99ll be going on Thursday, because it\xe2\x80\x99s Anything Can Happen Thursday.\nLeonard: Way to think outside but pressed right up against the box, Sheldon.\nRaj: So what are we going to do tonight?\nHoward: If I may proffer a suggestion, in bars all across this great nation of ours, Thursday night is Ladies\xe2\x80\x99 Night. Which means, as the evening progresses, we will get better looking courtesy of 99 cent margaritas and two-for-one Jell-O shots.\nLeonard: Come on, Howard, the odds of us picking up girls in a bar are practically zero.\nHoward: Really? Are you familiar with the Drake Equation?\nSheldon: The one that estimates the odds of making contact with extraterrestrials by calculating the product of an increasingly restrictive series of fractional values such as those stars with planets, and those planets likely to develop life? N equals R times FP times NE times FL times FI times FC times L?\nHoward: Yeah, that one. You can modify it to calculate our chances of having sex by changing the formula to use the number of single women in Los Angeles, the number of those who might find us attractive, and what I call the Wolowitz Coefficient.\nRaj: The Wolowitz Coefficient?\nHoward: Neediness times dress size squared. Crunching the numbers, I come up with a conservative 5,812 potential sex partners within a 40-mile radius.\nLeonard: You\xe2\x80\x99re joking.\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m a horny engineer, Leonard. I never joke about math or sex.\nRaj: Well, what are we waiting for? Let\xe2\x80\x99s bounce, bitches.\nLeonard: You\xe2\x80\x99re right. It\xe2\x80\x99s Anything Can Happen Thursday, let\xe2\x80\x99s hit the clubs and meet hot women!\nRaj: Here we go. Lock up your daughters! We\xe2\x80\x99re going to hit it and quit it.\nLeonard: Or we could finish eating and go to the comic book store.\nRaj: Also a good plan.\nHoward: Alright, but next Anything Can Happen Thursday, we\xe2\x80\x99re definitely going to a bar.\nLeonard: Oh, absolutely.\nRaj: You heard that, Ladies\xe2\x80\x99 Night ladies? We\xe2\x80\x99re eventually coming for you!\nSheldon: Fascinating.\nCredits sequence.\nPenny: Oh hey, guys, where\xe2\x80\x99re you headed?\nSheldon: To the comic book store. You\xe2\x80\x99re probably thinking, the comic book store? On a Thursday? Why, I\xe2\x80\x99ve fallen down the rabbit hole and into a land of madness. What you have failed to take into account, Penny, is that this is Anything Can Happen Thursday.\nPenny: You got me. While you\xe2\x80\x99re there, could pick me up a few comics for my nephew\xe2\x80\x99s birthday?\nSheldon: I think you mean comic books. Comics are feeble attempts at humour featuring talking babies and anthropomorphized pets found traditionally in the optimistically named funny pages.\nPenny: Leonard, could you pick me up a few comics for my nephew\xe2\x80\x99s birthday?\nLeonard: Sure. What does he like?\nPenny: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, he\xe2\x80\x99s 13. Just pick out anything.\nSheldon: Just pick out anything? Maybe at the same time we can pick out a new suit for him without knowing his size, or pick out his career for him without knowing his aptitude, or pick out a new breakfast cereal without knowing his fibre requirements or his feelings about little marshmallows.\nPenny: Spider-Man. Get him Spider-Man.\nSheldon: Amazing Spider-Man, Ultimate Spider-Man, Spectacular Spider-Man, The Marvelous Adventures of Spider-Man, Spider-Man 2099?\nPenny: Leonard?\nLeonard: You know this can go on all night, why don\xe2\x80\x99t you just come with us?\nPenny: Ugh, that\xe2\x80\x99s what I was trying to avoid.\nSheldon: Oh, I forgot Sensational Spider-Man.\nScene: The comic book store.\n  Penny: Oh, what a cute, little store. Everybody\xe2\x80\x99s staring at me.\nLeonard: Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry, they\xe2\x80\x99re more scared of you than you are of them.\nPenny: Unlikely. Here, what about this one for my nephew?\nSheldon: A superb choice.\nPenny: Oh, great.\nSheldon: Yeah, provided he has already read Infinite Crisis and 52, and is familiar with the re-establishment of the DC multiverse.\nPenny: What\xe2\x80\x99s a multiverse?\nSheldon: Get her out of here.\nLeonard: Come on, I\xe2\x80\x99ll help you pick something.\nRaj: That\xe2\x80\x99s right. She\xe2\x80\x99s with us. Guys like that are so pathetic.\nHoward: Tell me about it. Look, a new Batman belt buckle.\nStore clerk: Oh, hey, Leonard. Can I help you find something?\nLeonard: Oh, hey, Stuart. This is Penny. She\xe2\x80\x99s looking for some comic books.\nStuart: Oh, really. Blink twice if you\xe2\x80\x99re here against your will.\nLeonard: I think we\xe2\x80\x99re fine, Stuart.\nStuart: Let me know if you need anything.\nPenny: Thanks. He seems like a nice guy.\nLeonard: You mean for someone who\xe2\x80\x99s into comic books?\nPenny: No, no, no, I just meant for\xe2\x80\xa6 yeah.\nLeonard: Penny, just because people appreciate comic books doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make them weirdos. Stuart\xe2\x80\x99s a terrific artist. He went to the Rhode Island School of Design.\nPenny: What about the guy over there in the superhero T-shirt tucked into his sweatpants?\nLeonard: Ah, yeah, that\xe2\x80\x99s Captain Sweatpants. He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t really help the point I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to make.\n(Howard and Sheldon are looking through a rack of comic books. Each says \xe2\x80\x9cGot it\xe2\x80\x9d in turn as they look past each book until they eventually reach the one in the middle when they both together grab the book and shout \xe2\x80\x9cNeed it!\xe2\x80\x9d)\n  Howard: Let it go, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Why should I let it go? I saw it first.\nHoward: Yes, but I saw it from the front.\nSheldon: A far less impressive feat.\nHoward: Oh, come on! I need this for my Batman collection.\nSheldon: I need it for my Robin collection.\nHoward: Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock?\nSheldon: Why would I gamble? It\xe2\x80\x99s mine. Let go.\nHoward: You let go.\nSheldon: No, you!\nLeonard: Problem?\nSheldon: Yes, he won\xe2\x80\x99t let go of my comic book.\nHoward: It\xe2\x80\x99s my comic book!\nSheldon: Leonard, we need a ruling.\nLeonard: Uh, cut it in half?\nPenny: Excuse me.\nStuart: Hello again.\nPenny: Hi. What would you recommend as a present for a 13-year-old boy?\nStuart: A 13-year-old girl. But if you\xe2\x80\x99re dead set on a comic book, try this.\nPenny: Oh, Hellblazer. What\xe2\x80\x99s this about?\nStuart: A morally ambiguous confidence man who smokes, has lung cancer and is tormented by the spirits of the undead.\nPenny: Well, if that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make me the favourite aunt, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what will. Is this me?\nStuart: Depends. Do you like it?\nPenny: It\xe2\x80\x99s really good.\nStuart: Yes, that\xe2\x80\x99s you.\nPenny: That\xe2\x80\x99s so sweet, but what if I didn\xe2\x80\x99t like it?\nStuart: It\xe2\x80\x99d still be you, but I\xe2\x80\x99d feel like an idiot.\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe it. Stuart\xe2\x80\x99s putting the moves on Penny.\nHoward: I have got to learn how to draw. Hey!\nSheldon: Once again, defeated by your own prurient interests.\nRaj: Guys, have you seen Stuart all up in Penny\xe2\x80\x99s business over there?\nLeonard: Nobody\xe2\x80\x99s up in anybody\xe2\x80\x99s business, let\xe2\x80\x99s just buy our stuff and go.\nPenny: Okay, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got my number, now, give me the picture.\nStuart: You drive a hard bargain, but here.\nPenny: All right. So, um, just give me a call.\nSheldon: So, Leonard, how are you enjoying Anything Can Happen Thursday?\nScene: The apartment. Sheldon has the comic book.\n  Sheldon: Look at that, that\xe2\x80\x99s a dent. Thank you, Howard Ham-Fisted Wolowitz. Did you just shut the TV off in the middle of the classic Deep Space Nine/Star Trek The Original Series Trouble With Tribbles crossover episode?\nLeonard: Apparently so.\nSheldon: Are you ill?\nLeonard: No.\nSheldon: All right. Then is it fair to say that you\xe2\x80\x99re experiencing some sort of emotional turmoil over the events involving Penny earlier this evening?\nLeonard: When did you pick up on that?\nSheldon: A moment ago, when you turned off the TV in the middle of }during the classic Deep Space Nine/Star Trek The Original Series Trouble With Tribbles crossover episode. Would you like some advice?\nLeonard: Sure, why not?\nSheldon: Then, this is the perfect time to launch a blog with an interactive comments section.\nLeonard: Gee, thanks a lot.\nSheldon: Would you rather I offer my personal insight?\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t need any insights. I just want to know why Penny\xe2\x80\x99s more interested in Stuart than me. We\xe2\x80\x99re practically the same guy.\nSheldon: Oh, I disagree. Stuart is taller, artistic, self-employed and, most significantly, he gets 45 percent off comic books.\nLeonard: You\xe2\x80\x99re right, I really should be asking strangers on the Internet.\nSheldon: My original point.\nScene: The stairs.\n  Sheldon: Chinese food, vintage video games. After the nightmare of Anything Can Happen Thursday, this is Friday night the way it was meant to be.\nHoward: Who\xe2\x80\x99s up for Sheldon-Free Saturday?\nPenny (coming out of apartment): Oh, hey guys.\nLeonard: Hey, Penny\xe2\x80\xa6 and Stuart, hey Stuart.\nStuart: Hey, guys.\nHoward: So what are you kids up to?\nPenny: Uh, Stuart has a piece in an art show that\xe2\x80\x99s opening tonight.\nLeonard: And you guys are going together, great\xe2\x80\xa6\nStuart: It is great. Really great. Freaking awesome. What are you guys doing?\nPenny: It\xe2\x80\x99s Friday night, that means Chinese food and vintage video games, right?\nSheldon: Vintage doesn\xe2\x80\x99t even begin to describe what we have planned. Tonight, we are playing the classic 1980 interactive text adventure, Zork. It\xe2\x80\x99s the buggy beta version.\nPenny: Wow, Zork. Well, you guys have fun.\nStuart: Yeah, see you guys.\nHoward: See you, Stuart.\nLeonard: Hey, Howard?\nHoward: Yes.\nLeonard: Take me to a bar with women.\nHoward: Really?\nLeonard: Yeah.\nHoward: Okay! Let me just go inside and slip off my underwear.\nLeonard: Why?\nHoward: Well, if I get lucky, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be caught in my Aquaman briefs.\nLeonard (to Raj): Do you\xe2\x80\xa6? (Raj checks his underwear) Let\xe2\x80\x99s go.\nScene: A bar.\nRaj: May I have a grasshopper with a little umbrella, please?\nHoward: No, he may not.\nRaj: Why?\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m not sitting here with a guy drinking a grasshopper with a little umbrella.\nRaj: Fine. I\xe2\x80\x99ll have a chocolate martini.\nHoward: Wrong again!\nRaj: Come on, you know I can\xe2\x80\x99t talk to women unless I\xe2\x80\x99m lit up like the Hindu festival of Diwali.\nHoward: Look, there are plenty of bars in Los Angeles where you can order grasshoppers and chocolate martinis, but you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have to because there are no women in them.\nRaj: Gotcha. I\xe2\x80\x99ll have a Brandy Alexander.\nHoward: All right, the Three Musketeers just became the Dynamic Duo.\nLeonard: Should we talk to some of these women?\nHoward: It\xe2\x80\x99s way too early in the night for that. See, first we let the lawyers and the jocks thin the herd, and then we go after the weak and the old and the lame.\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99s your system?\nHoward: That\xe2\x80\x99s my system. Oh, and if you spot a chick with a Seeing Eye dog, she\xe2\x80\x99s mine.\nScene: The stairwell.\nPenny: Oh come on. I think it\xe2\x80\x99s nice that Captain Sweatpants showed up to your art opening.\nStuart: Yeah, it would have been nicer if he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t touched all the cheese.\nPenny: Um, you know, it\xe2\x80\x99s kind of early. Do you want to maybe come in for some coffee or something?\nStuart: Oh, gee, it\xe2\x80\x99s a little late for coffee, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\nPenny: Oh, you think coffee, means coffee, that is so sweet. Come on, I think I have decaf.\nSheldon: Oh, good, Stuart, I thought I heard your voice. Do you have a moment?\nStuart: Uh, yeah, I guess.\nPenny: Sheldon, we\xe2\x80\x99re a little busy here, so\xe2\x80\xa6\nSheldon: What are you doing?\nStuart: We\xe2\x80\x99re having coffee.\nSheldon: Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it a little late for coffee?\nStuart: It\xe2\x80\x99s okay. She thinks she has decaf.\nPenny: I\xe2\x80\x99ll just go look for it.\nStuart: What\xe2\x80\x99s up?\nSheldon: Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ve spent the last three hours in an online debate in the DC Comics Batman chatroom, and I need your help.\nStuart: Oh yeah. Those guys can be very stubborn. What\xe2\x80\x99s the topic?\nSheldon: I am asserting, in the event that Batman\xe2\x80\x99s death proves permanent, that original Robin, Dick Grayson, is the logical successor to the Bat Cowl.\nStuart: Ooh, Sheldon, I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be more wrong.\nSheldon: More wrong? Wrong is an absolute state and not subject to gradation.\nStuart: Of course it is. It\xe2\x80\x99s a little wrong to say a tomato is a vegetable, it\xe2\x80\x99s very wrong to say it\xe2\x80\x99s a suspension bridge. But returning to the original issue, Dick Grayson became Nightwing, a superhero in his own right. Batman 2 has to be the second Robin, Jason Todd.\nSheldon: Has to be? Has to be? I hope you\xe2\x80\x99re being deliberately provocative.\nPenny: I found the decaf!\nStuart: Oh, great!\nSheldon: Yeah, herbal tea for me, please.\nScene: The bar.\nRaj: Barkeep! Alexander me.\nLeonard: How about those two?\nHoward: Nah, they\xe2\x80\x99re eating peanuts, and my allergies, one kiss would put me in Cedar-Sinai for a week.\nLeonard: What about the ones in the corner?\nHoward: Possible, very possible. Do you want the one in the whiplash collar or the one who keeps blinking?\nLeonard: I think Blinky\xe2\x80\x99s cute.\nHoward: You got it, sir.\nLeonard: Wait, so we just go over there?\nHoward: No, we have a little prep work to do. Put this in your mouth. We walk past them, you stumble a bit. I say, sorry, my friend\xe2\x80\x99s had a little too much, and then I start to pull it out of your mouth and say, a little too much fun. Get it? I mean, they\xe2\x80\x99re laughing, we\xe2\x80\x99re laughing, and then we get them up to about a .15 blood alcohol level, and tell them we\xe2\x80\x99re millionaires.\nLeonard: What else you got?\nHoward: Depends. Are you willing to sit on my lap and pretend to be a ventriloquist dummy?\nLeonard: No.\nHoward: I can\xe2\x80\x99t sit on your lap, you don\xe2\x80\x99t know the routine.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nStuart: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, but you\xe2\x80\x99re obviously stuck in a pre-Zero Hour DC universe.\nSheldon: Of course I am. Removing Joe Chill as the killer of Batman\xe2\x80\x99s parents effectively deprived him of his raison d\xe2\x80\x99\xc3\xaatre.\nStuart: Okay, you can throw all the French around you want, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make you right.\nSheldon: Au contraire.\nStuart: Plus, you\xe2\x80\x99re forgetting that the Infinite Crisis storyline restored Joe Chill to the Batman mythology.\nSheldon: I am forgetting nothing and I resent your tone.\nStuart: Okay, look, Sheldon, it\xe2\x80\x99s late and I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to get some sleep.\nSheldon: So, I win.\nStuart: No, I\xe2\x80\x99m tired.\nSheldon: So, I win.\nStuart: Fine. You win.\nSheldon: Darn tootin\xe2\x80\x99, I win.\nStuart: Penny, I really had a terrific time. Penny?\nSheldon: No, no, no, no, don\xe2\x80\x99t wake her. She\xe2\x80\x99ll maul you like a rabid wolverine.\nStuart: You know, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that was decaf.\nScene: The bar.\nHoward: Wait, is this your card or isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? Trust me, this was their card.\nLeonard: I thought you were good at this. You\xe2\x80\x99re always talking about how you go to bars and meet women.\nHoward: I do, all the time.\nLeonard: Well, what happened? We\xe2\x80\x99ve been sitting here all night and the longest conversation you\xe2\x80\x99ve had with a woman was when your mom called.\nHoward: Wow, you\xe2\x80\x99re just going to make me come out and say it, aren\xe2\x80\x99t you?\nLeonard: Say what?\nHoward: You\xe2\x80\x99re weighing me down. I\xe2\x80\x99m a falcon who hunts better solo.\nLeonard: Fine. I\xe2\x80\x99ll sit here. You take flight and hunt.\nHoward: Don\xe2\x80\x99t be ridiculous, you can\xe2\x80\x99t just tell a falcon when to hunt.\nLeonard: Actually, you can. There\xe2\x80\x99s a whole sport built around it. Falconry.\nHoward: Shut up. Let\xe2\x80\x99s just get Koothrappali and go. (They turn to see Raj with his tongue down the throat of a \xe2\x80\x9clarger lady\xe2\x80\x9d by the bar.) Lucky bastard. It\xe2\x80\x99s got to be that stupid accent of his. (To a girl nearby) Hello. I am Sanjay Wolowitz from Bombay. Okay, I\xe2\x80\x99m stumped.\nScene: Raj\xe2\x80\x99s apartment. He wakes up clutched in the arms of the large lady. Tries to get away. She clutches him tighter. He shrugs and goes back to sleep.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
