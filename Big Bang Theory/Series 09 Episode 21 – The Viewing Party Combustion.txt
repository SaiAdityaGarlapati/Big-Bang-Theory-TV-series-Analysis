b'Scene: The comic book store.\nSheldon: I have a question about Batman. Batman is a man who dresses up like a bat. Man-bat is a part man, part bat hybrid. Now, if Man-Bat dressed up as a man to fight crime, would he be Man-Batman?\nLeonard: No, he\xe2\x80\x99d be Bat-Man-Bat.\nRaj: But wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t Man-Batman just be a Batman that was bitten by a radioactive man?\nHoward: But Batman is a man. You\xe2\x80\x99re talking about a man who would have the powers of a man. That\xe2\x80\x99s just Man-Man.\nSheldon: Well, isn\xe2\x80\x99t Man-Man just Man?\nLeonard: But what if Man-Man dressed as a bat?\nRaj: Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s just Batman.\nLeonard: No, if a man dresses as a bat, that\xe2\x80\x99s Batman, but if Man-Man dresses as a bat, that\xe2\x80\x99s Batman-Man.\nHoward: So does that answer your question?\nSheldon: Oh, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t asked it yet.\nRaj (checking text on phone): Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s Claire. Got to run.\nLeonard: I thought you were back with Emily.\nRaj: Uh, actually I\xe2\x80\x99m seeing both of them.\nLeonard: You mean like through their window from behind a bush?\nRaj: No, I\xe2\x80\x99m actually dating two women. Later.\nLeonard: Really? The guy who for years couldn\xe2\x80\x99t even talk to women is suddenly going out with two of them? How is that possible?\nHoward: I know. Scientists have tried to reproduce it with computational models, but, in each case, the world blows up.\nLeonard: Seriously, that guy\xe2\x80\x99s dating two women?\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: What, why did you get a party sub?\nLeonard: People are coming over, it looked fun.\nSheldon: Well, we\xe2\x80\x99re only watching Game of Thrones. A party sub implies it\xe2\x80\x99s a party.\nLeonard: Your attendance implies it\xe2\x80\x99s not.\nSheldon: I like a party as much as the next man, as long as the next man doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like a party. Oh, by the way, don\xe2\x80\x99t forget, tomorrow is our quarterly roommate agreement meeting.\nLeonard: Oh, Sheldon, we don\xe2\x80\x99t need a meeting every three months.\nSheldon: Hmm? Well, it sounds like the kind of thing one would bring up at a quarterly roommate agreement meeting. Lucky for you it\xe2\x80\x99s tomorrow.\nLeonard: Oh, you know what? I\xe2\x80\x99m not going.\nSheldon: Well, you have to go. It\xe2\x80\x99s Penny\xe2\x80\x99s first time leading the Pledge of Allegiance.\nLeonard: This meeting is a waste of time. Whether we make the switch from Post Raisin Bran to Kellogg\xe2\x80\x99s Raisin Bran should not require parliamentary procedure.\nSheldon: You realize one of them has sugar on the raisins.\nLeonard: You\xe2\x80\x99re the only one who eats them.\nSheldon: And yet you get to weigh in. Democracy, it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty cool, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m not going, you can\xe2\x80\x99t make me.\nSheldon: Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ll just see about that.\nPenny: What is the problem?\nSheldon: He says he\xe2\x80\x99s not coming to the roommate agreement meeting tomorrow.\nPenny: Well, why the hell did I memorize the Pledge?\nLeonard: You have fun. I will not be attending.\nSheldon: Oh, fine. We don\xe2\x80\x99t have to have a roommate agreement meeting if you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to.\nLeonard: Thank you.\nSheldon: Of course, it will require a vote. Unfortunately, my official gavel is in my bedroom, but luckily, I have my travel gavel.\nLeonard: You\xe2\x80\x99re being ridiculous.\nSheldon: There\xe2\x80\x99s a motion on the floor, I\xe2\x80\x99m ridiculous. Do we have a second? Hmm? Hmm? There is no second. The motion is denied. Next time, make sure you have the votes first. That was embarrassing.\nLeonard: Can you please talk to him?\nPenny: Well, why are you fighting him on this?\nLeonard: Because I am tired of him always getting his way. We don\xe2\x80\x99t need a stupid meeting. We don\xe2\x80\x99t even need a roommate agreement, and I hope that sandwich does cause a party.\nPenny: Well, I will still come to your meeting.\nSheldon: Well, I should hope so. Tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s picture day.\nLeonard: Why are you taking his side?\nPenny: Because it\xe2\x80\x99s important to him, and when we signed the roommate agreement, we made a deal.\nSheldon: You keep talking like that, you\xe2\x80\x99re gonna make colour guard.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s house.\nRaj: Man, I\xe2\x80\x99m worn out.\nHoward: I know. Imagine if we were actually moving.\nRaj: No, it\xe2\x80\x99s just, ever since I started dating Claire and Emily at the same time, it\xe2\x80\x99s exhausting.\nHoward: You\xe2\x80\x99re exhausted? Try folding every five pages in a pregnancy book so your wife thinks you read it.\nRaj: But, dude, you\xe2\x80\x99re so lucky. Getting to stay home at night with the woman you love.\nHoward: I guess I am lucky.\nRaj: You are, because dating two women, I mean, I can\xe2\x80\x99t even remember the last time I slept in my own apartment. I wake up and I\xe2\x80\x99m like, am I at Claire\xe2\x80\x99s or am I at Emily\xe2\x80\x99s? Is there a third girl I\xe2\x80\x99ve forgotten about? Like, where am I?\nBernadette: Hey, Raj.\nRaj: Hey, how\xe2\x80\x99s the mommy-to-be?\nBernadette: Good. A little tired.\nRaj: I feel you. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been dating multiple women.\nHoward: You sure you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to come watch Game of Thrones with us?\nBernadette: You guys have fun. I\xe2\x80\x99m just gonna snuggle up in bed with a book.\nRaj: Oh, that sounds great, a bed to yourself. Can\xe2\x80\x99t even remember what that\xe2\x80\x99s like.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Are you up-to-date on Game of Thrones?\nPenny: Mm, I think so. Dragons, snow zombies, and all the hot guys are dead.\nSheldon: Oh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Theon Greyjoy looks pretty good for a guy who had his genitals cut off.\nPenny: Uh-oh, somebody\xe2\x80\x99s still pouting.\nLeonard: Leave me alone.\nPenny: If it\xe2\x80\x99s because you lost a stick, I know where it went.\nLeonard: Not funny.\nPenny: You know you\xe2\x80\x99re gonna make up with him. Can we just skip to that part?\nLeonard: Oh, of course, because I\xe2\x80\x99m the only adult around here.\nPenny: Really? The only adult?\nLeonard: Yeah, that\xe2\x80\x99s right.\nSheldon: Tonight I\xe2\x80\x99ll be watching a show rated M.A., and that stands for mature audiences, buster.\nPenny: All right, you would think the only adult wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t let something silly ruin our entire night.\nLeonard: And I\xe2\x80\x99d think you\xe2\x80\x99d understand why I\xe2\x80\x99m annoyed.\nSheldon: All this could be avoided if you\xe2\x80\x99d just come to the meeting.\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to.\nSheldon: Oh, it\xe2\x80\x99s just a meeting. One simple meeting.\nLeonard: Stop saying meeting.\nSheldon: Meeting, meeting, bo-beeting, banana-fana, fo-feeting, fee-fi mo-meeting.\nAmy: I brought my famous spinach dip.\nSheldon: Yeah, Amy, just one second. Meeting.\nScene: Howard\xe2\x80\x99s car.\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure if I\xe2\x80\x99m hoping for a boy or a girl. I mean, if it\xe2\x80\x99s a boy, I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna have to teach him to play catch. Which means I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna have to google how to play catch. If it\xe2\x80\x99s a girl, I mean, they\xe2\x80\x99re so innocent and you know how guys are.\nRaj: Totally, guys are the worst. I mean, look at me. I let Emily make me a frittata and I kept the leftovers in Claire\xe2\x80\x99s fridge that night. I\xe2\x80\x99m such a dog.\nHoward: There you go again.\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, have I been complaining about it too much?\nHoward: Actually, what you\xe2\x80\x99re doing is pretending to complain, but really trying to brag.\nRaj: How could you say that?\nHoward: Oh, I wish could enjoy a cup of tea without a naked girl bouncing up and down on me.\nRaj: I never said that.\nHoward: Don\xe2\x80\x99t you hate it when you can\xe2\x80\x99t remember whose bra it is you found wedged in your couch?\nRaj: Okay, that I said. But that\xe2\x80\x99s a real problem. You give a girl another woman\xe2\x80\x99s bra, and you will not be having sex with her that night. Maybe the other girl, but not her.\nScene: The apartment.\nAmy: What\xe2\x80\x99s going on with him?\nPenny: Oh, he\xe2\x80\x99s all bent out of shape about having a roommate agreement meeting.\nSheldon: Apparently, perfect attendance isn\xe2\x80\x99t cool any more.\nPenny: Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry, he\xe2\x80\x99ll come around.\nAmy: Well, I get why he\xe2\x80\x99s annoyed.\nSheldon: Well, then you don\xe2\x80\x99t understand what\xe2\x80\x99s happening. See, Leonard refused to participate in a mandatory quarterly roommate agreement meeting. This is what a generation raised on Bart Simpson looks like.\nLeonard: You love The Simpsons.\nSheldon: I love Lisa Simpson.\nAmy: Well, I know how he feels. I never enjoyed our relationship agreement meetings.\nSheldon: Wait. You were pretending?\nAmy: Sorry.\nSheldon: No. I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe you. I could tell.\nAmy: Oh, Sheldon, I never thought re-filing a matter in a standing subcommittee could be so fascinating.\nSheldon: Hmm, what do you think?\nPenny: You don\xe2\x80\x99t know?\nScene: The stairwell.\nRaj: Hey, did I say something to upset you?\nHoward: No, I\xe2\x80\x99m fine.\nRaj: Really? Because usually we walk side by side, and I just went up two flights of stairs staring at your bottom.\nHoward: Just drop it.\nRaj: Okay, I think I see what\xe2\x80\x99s happening here. You\xe2\x80\x99re jealous of me.\nHoward: Oh, please. What could you possibly have that I would be jealous of?\nRaj: It\xe2\x80\x99s not what I have, it\xe2\x80\x99s how many people I\xe2\x80\x99m having it with.\nPenny: Come on, Sheldon, we\xe2\x80\x99ll watch Game of Thrones over here.\nSheldon: Gladly.\nLeonard: Oh, good, go. You know, it\xe2\x80\x99ll be nice to watch an episode without someone saying, I read the books, don\xe2\x80\x99t get too fond of this character.\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s not always because they die. In one case, it\xe2\x80\x99s because they\xe2\x80\x99ve become involved with underground tree people from the dawn of time. Yeah, but I won\xe2\x80\x99t say who it is. It\xe2\x80\x99s Brann.\nHoward: Wait, what is going on?\nPenny: Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s being a jerk, so we\xe2\x80\x99re gonna watch over here.\nAmy: Do you guys want to watch with us?\nHoward: As long as I don\xe2\x80\x99t have to watch with him.\nRaj: Fine, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to watch with you either. I\xe2\x80\x99ll go over here.\nHoward: Why do you get to pick?\nRaj: Okay, then you go there.\nHoward: Don\xe2\x80\x99t tell me where to go.\nLeonard: Howard, just come in here.\nPenny: Yeah, come on, Raj.\nRaj: Wait, did Amy make her spinach dip?\nSheldon: She did.\nHoward: And I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna eat it all.\nScene: The apartment.\nHoward: So what the hell happened?\nLeonard: Oh, I just ran out of patience with Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s nonsense.\nHoward: Tell me about it. I\xe2\x80\x99ve had it with Raj, too.\nAmy: You know, like women, men have a monthly hormone cycle. Dips in testosterone can cause irritability.\nHoward: Interesting. Maybe my male cycle synced up with Raj\xe2\x80\x99s actual period.\nLeonard: If Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s testosterone dipped, he\xe2\x80\x99d become a butterfly. (Knock on door) Oh. Maybe someone\xe2\x80\x99s here to apologize.\nStuart: Hey, Leonard.\nLeonard: Stuart.\nStuart: Uh, is this not a dress-up party?\nLeonard: No.\nStuart: Was it ever a dress-up party?\nLeonard: No.\nStuart: Howard, didn\xe2\x80\x99t you tell me it was a dress-up party?\nHoward: Yeah.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment. Knock on door.\nStuart: I was told this is where to go if I\xe2\x80\x99m mad at Howard.\nPenny: May I take your cloak?\nStuart: Thanks. This thing kept getting caught in the chain of my bike.\nSheldon: Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll catch you up. Uh, Penny is angry at Leonard, Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s angry at me and Penny, I\xe2\x80\x99m angry at Leonard and Amy, Raj is angry at Howard, and I\xe2\x80\x99m angry at George R.R. Martin \xe2\x80\x99cause there are no new books for me to spoil for Leonard.\nStuart: So what happened with you and Howard?\nRaj: Says I was talking too much about dating Claire and Emily, and I accused him of being jealous.\nStuart: I\xe2\x80\x99m jealous. Closest I\xe2\x80\x99ve come to dating two women was that time I dated one woman.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how you put up with it. He\xe2\x80\x99s impossible. I mean, holding a meeting to decide what breakfast cereal we should buy.\nHoward: Yeah. Cap\xe2\x80\x99n Crunch with Crunch Berries, move on.\nLeonard: Anyway, Amy, thank you for sticking up for me.\nAmy: Oh, I honestly couldn\xe2\x80\x99t care less.\nLeonard: Sorry?\nAmy: Well, I just took your side \xe2\x80\x99cause sometimes I get annoyed at how close Sheldon and Penny are.\nLeonard: Well, they argue all the time. They aren\xe2\x80\x99t that close.\nAmy: Who\xe2\x80\x99s always comforting him when he\xe2\x80\x99s upset?\nLeonard: Penny, but\xe2\x80\xa6\nAmy: Who\xe2\x80\x99s the only one who can make him take his medicine when he\xe2\x80\x99s sick?\nLeonard: I try to hide it in his peanut butter, but he spits it out.\nAmy: Okay. And did you know she has him add things to the roommate agreement so she can get her way and not fight with you about it?\nLeonard: Son of a bitch. Why is that funny?\nHoward: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I like the pain of others.\nLeonard: Oh, well, then you\xe2\x80\x99ll enjoy this. Bernadette does the same thing with you and Koothrappali.\nHoward: No, she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t.\nLeonard: She defends him all the time.\nHoward: She does not.\nAmy: Who told you to stop making all those Gandhi jokes about him?\nHoward: Well, she did. And human resources.\nLeonard: Who do you think told Koothrappali to go to human resources?\nHoward: Son of a bitch.\nLeonard: You\xe2\x80\x99re, you\xe2\x80\x99re right, it feels good.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nRaj: All right, it\xe2\x80\x99s almost game time. Get it? Game of Thrones, game time?\nStuart: Two women, huh?\nSheldon (at knock on door): Oh, perhaps it\xe2\x80\x99s Amy coming to her senses.\nPenny: What\xe2\x80\x99s up?\nLeonard: You know, you don\xe2\x80\x99t need to use Sheldon to get your way with me in a dumb roommate agreement.\nPenny: Where\xe2\x80\x99d you get that from?\nLeonard: From Amy.\nPenny: Ugh. Amy, why did you tell him that?\nAmy: Because you were defending Sheldon like you always do.\nPenny: I don\xe2\x80\x99t always defend Sheldon.\nLeonard: Oh, yes, you do. You know you have a weird brother-sister-Elliott-E.T. relationship with him.\nPenny: What about your weird relationship with him?\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99s different. I\xe2\x80\x99m like the little girl in Poltergeist and he\xe2\x80\x99s the creepy thing in the TV.\nHoward: Um, guys? Were there any nuts in that food?\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t think so. Why?\nHoward: Well just a feeling.\nScene: A hospital waiting room.\nLeonard: It just said Italian sub. I had no idea mortadella has pistachios in it.\nSheldon: Interesting fact, in Italian, the morta in mortadella means death.\nAmy: Sheldon.\nSheldon: I didn\xe2\x80\x99t say fun fact. I\xe2\x80\x99m not a monster.\nBernadette: He\xe2\x80\x99s gonna be okay.\nSheldon: Now it\xe2\x80\x99s a fun fact.\nStuart: Boy, stuff like this really puts things in perspective.\nBernadette: Why are you dressed like that?\nStuart: Oh, uh, Howard thought it\xe2\x80\x99d be funny to tell me it was a costume party.\nBernadette: That wasn\xe2\x80\x99t nice.\nStuart: No, but he almost died, so we\xe2\x80\x99re cool.\nRaj: You know, if you think about it, tonight was kind of like a real-life Game of Thrones.\nAmy: How?\nRaj: Well, Howard eating that pistachio was like when King Joffrey got poisoned.\nPenny: Okay, well, that was murder, this was an accident.\nRaj: Okay. But you using Sheldon to do your dirty work is like when Cersei used the King\xe2\x80\x99s Guard to do her bidding.\nSheldon: Cersei uses her body to manipulate men. Penny just takes me to The LEGO Store.\nRaj: Okay. Oh, how about this? Stuart\xe2\x80\x99s dressed like a brother of the Night\xe2\x80\x99s Watch, and they don\xe2\x80\x99t have sex.\nPenny: There you go.\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99s true.\nSheldon: Fair enough.\nHoward: Hey.\nLeonard: Hey.\nBernadette: You all right?\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m fine. Just a little embarrassed I had to be carried down the stairs like a baby. Thanks.\nLeonard: Let\xe2\x80\x99s get out of here.\nAmy: That was scary.\nSheldon: Well, the important thing is I said that big sandwich would ruin everything, and I was right.\nScene: The street.\nRaj (shouting from upstairs window): Hey, Jon Snow. How come your horse has a basket on it?\nStuart: How come your head has your face on it?\nSheldon: They don\xe2\x80\x99t wear bicycle helmets in Game of Thrones. You\xe2\x80\x99re thematically inaccurate, but I applaud your commitment to safety.\nStuart: Don\xe2\x80\x99t you guys have anything better to do?\nLeonard: Better than watching a guy in a fur cloak ride a girl\xe2\x80\x99s bike? Nope.\nStuart: That\xe2\x80\x99s it, you just lost bathroom privileges at the comic book store. Horse has a basket on it. Stupid\xe2\x80\xa6 aaargh!\nScene: Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom.\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard. (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard. (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard.\nLeonard: What?\nSheldon: I never got to ask my question about Batman.\nLeonard: What is it?\nSheldon: If Batman were bitten by a radioactive Man-Bat, and then fought crime disguised as Man-Bat, would he be Man-Bat-Man-Bat-Man or simply Man-Bat-Man-Bat-Batman?\nPenny: Is he still wearing the Batman suit under the Man-Bat suit?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99ll be back.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
