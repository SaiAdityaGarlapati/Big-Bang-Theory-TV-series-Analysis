b'Scene: The stairwell.\nLeonard: What\xe2\x80\x99s going on with that woman you\xe2\x80\x99re dating?\nRaj: I broke up with her.\nLeonard: Why?\nRaj: She said she didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to see me any more and I found that insulting.\nHoward: I thought things were going well. What happened?\nRaj: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, she didn\xe2\x80\x99t even give me a reason.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s not a problem, we can figure this out. What are the reasons women reject Raj?\nRaj: Can we not play this game?\nSheldon: Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like games. That\xe2\x80\x99s one.\nLeonard: Ignore him. Yeah, sorry about the breakup.\nRaj: That\xe2\x80\x99s okay, I\xe2\x80\x99m fine.\nSheldon: Of course you\xe2\x80\x99re fine. Not every member of a species finds a mate. Sir Isaac Newton died a virgin, look at the contributions he made.\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99m not a virgin, Sheldon.\nSheldon: So now you think you\xe2\x80\x99re better than Isaac Newton? Oh, no wonder women don\xe2\x80\x99t like you.\nLeonard: You\xe2\x80\x99re not being very nice.\nSheldon: What? He said he was fine.\nHoward: Sometimes people say things they don\xe2\x80\x99t mean.\nSheldon: Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s a paradox. I mean if you meant what you just said, then that means you may not have meant what you just said.\nLeonard: Careful, I saw this on Star Trek. Smoke\xe2\x80\x99s gonna come out of his ears soon. Hey.\nPenny: Hey, boys. How\xe2\x80\x99s it going?\nSheldon: Well, I thought we were having a nice conversation, but it turns out I was being offensive.\nBernadette: So, normal.\nSheldon: Yeah.\nAmy: Sheldon, what did you do?\nSheldon: We were discussing Raj\xe2\x80\x99s recent breakup and apparently, I was insensitive to him.\nRaj: It\xe2\x80\x99s okay, I\xe2\x80\x99m fine.\nSheldon: Don\xe2\x80\x99t fall for it. He\xe2\x80\x99ll get you to compare him to a dead virgin, and suddenly you\xe2\x80\x99re the bad guy.\nRaj: Sheldon, when I said I was fine, I meant I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to talk about it any more.\nSheldon: Then why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you say that?\nHoward: Because that\xe2\x80\x99s not what people do.\nSheldon: Well, I would prefer if people told me exactly what is on their mind.\nPenny: No. No, you don\xe2\x80\x99t, you really don\xe2\x80\x99t. I actually can\xe2\x80\x99t say don\xe2\x80\x99t enough.\nSheldon: Well, it certainly would be easier. You have no idea what it\xe2\x80\x99s like to struggle with recognizing emotional cues.\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99m sure it\xe2\x80\x99s extremely frustrating.\nSheldon: Thank you.\nAmy: And also a little sad.\nSheldon: Okay, now you\xe2\x80\x99re just showing off.\nBernadette: You know, I just read that a team at MIT. developed a device that helps people read human emotions.\nLeonard: And you think we can get those guys to reprogram Sheldon? Cool.\nBernadette: It\xe2\x80\x99s supposed to be accurate, like, 85% of the time.\nPenny: Wow, I find that hard to believe.\nLeonard: That a bunch of awkward scientists with no social skills would invent a machine to do it for them?\nPenny: I take it back. I believe it.\nHoward: You if it\xe2\x80\x99s at MIT, I can make some calls. Maybe we can get Sheldon a prototype.\nAmy: What do you think?\nSheldon: A machine that reads emotions is intriguing. It could help me be a more considerate friend.\nBernadette: Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t that be nice.\nSheldon: It could also help me identify my enemies, discover their fears and then I could use those fears to destroy them.\nBernadette: I like the first one.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The comic book store.\nRaj: Now that Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s across the hall, have you decided what you\xe2\x80\x99re doing with his old room?\nLeonard: I was thinking maybe a library or a gaming room.\nSheldon: You could make it a train room.\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t like trains. You like trains.\nSheldon: I know, and Amy says I can\xe2\x80\x99t have a train room.\nHoward: Sheldon, I just heard from the guys at MIT about that emotion reader. They\xe2\x80\x99re sending a prototype for you to beta test.\nSheldon: Wonderful. Although I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure how I feel about being used as a guinea pig.\nLeonard: Well, when you get the machine, you can find out.\nRaj: Maybe I could use it to understand why women keep dumping me.\nHoward: Well, you don\xe2\x80\x99t need a machine for that, just send a survey card to all your ex-girlfriends and tell them if they fill it out they might win a prize.\nRaj: That\xe2\x80\x99s actually not a bad idea. Maybe I could even get them all together, sort of like a, a focus group, to find out what\xe2\x80\x99s wrong with me.\nLeonard: No, Raj, that\xe2\x80\x99s a terrible idea.\nHoward: Yeah, I was joking.\nSheldon: Really? Uh, little tip: jokes are often better when you end them with wocka wocka or ha-cha-cha.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: Hey, great news. The TV I want will fit in the gaming room, and if I leave the curtains open, I can watch it from work.\nPenny: Hey, can you hold off redoing the room? My brother\xe2\x80\x99s coming out here in a few weeks.\nLeonard: Oh. Yeah. Okay, sure. What\xe2\x80\x99s going on with your brother?\nPenny: My dad asked if I can get him a job interview at my work.\nLeonard: Huh. Is that a good idea? I mean, you think they\xe2\x80\x99ll consider someone who was in prison for selling drugs?\nPenny: Well, I sell pharmaceuticals. That\xe2\x80\x99s just a really hard to spell word for drugs.\nLeonard: Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure he\xe2\x80\x99ll appreciate carrying his samples in a briefcase instead of his colon. How long do you think he\xe2\x80\x99ll stay?\nPenny: I, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure. Maybe a few days. Unless he gets the job, then who knows?\nLeonard: Hmm. Who knows? That\xe2\x80\x99s exciting. I\xe2\x80\x99ll get to wake up every morning and see if he\xe2\x80\x99s still here.\nPenny: You don\xe2\x80\x99t have a problem with this, do you?\nLeonard: Of course not. I mean, he\xe2\x80\x99s your brother.\nPenny: Okay. Thank you, you\xe2\x80\x99re the best. Mm.\nLeonard: Remember that when the new TV falls off the wall and crushes us both.\nScene: Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s office.\nHoward: This thing\xe2\x80\x99s pretty cool. It interprets emotions using a wireless signal to analyse subtle changes in breathing and heart rate.\nAmy: It\xe2\x80\x99s amazing a machine can do that.\nSheldon: Yes. Now, when the robots rise up, they\xe2\x80\x99ll know that I\xe2\x80\x99ve been rooting for them the whole time.\nHoward: The display is synced to your phone. Give it a try.\nAmy: All right. Now, I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna look at some pictures to prompt an emotional response, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll see if the machine can identify them accurately.\nHoward: Okay, remember, it can only detect happy, sad, angry and excited. Not other things you\xe2\x80\x99re feeling, like, what have I done with my life?\nAmy: Okay, I\xe2\x80\x99m looking at the first picture.\nSheldon: You are happy?\nAmy: Yes. I\xe2\x80\x99m looking at puppi\nSheldon: Aw. Somebody\xe2\x80\x99s ignoring their tiny needle teeth, but all right.\nHoward: Try another one.\nAmy: Okay. What does it say I\xe2\x80\x99m feeling?\nSheldon: Sad.\nAmy: Yes. I\xe2\x80\x99m looking at a picture of my grandma.\nSheldon: Oh, that makes sense, \xe2\x80\x99cause she\xe2\x80\x99s gone and you miss her.\nAmy: Yes.\nSheldon: And you\xe2\x80\x99re worried that turkey neck is in your future. What, now, see, now it says you\xe2\x80\x99re mad. Make up your mind.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s kitchen.\nRaj (on phone): Okay, Emily. Yeah, sounds great. See you then.\nBernadette: Is that Emily your ex-girlfriend?\nRaj: Yeah. I\xe2\x80\x99m getting all my exes together in order to discuss why they broke up with me and how I can be a better boyfriend.\nHoward: Oh, God. You went through with that? What is wrong with you?\nRaj: We are going to find out.\nBernadette: Why would you do that, Raj?\nRaj: Well, I want information in order to improve myself.\nBernadette: You\xe2\x80\x99re not gonna get information, you\xe2\x80\x99re just gonna get criticism that hurts your feelings.\nRaj: Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry, I\xe2\x80\x99m a grown man. I have a thick skin.\nHoward: You\xe2\x80\x99re so stupid.\nRaj: Hey.\nScene: The apartment.\nPenny: Hey, would you take a look at my brother\xe2\x80\x99s r\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9? I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to help him clean it up a little.\nLeonard: Yeah, sure. He really worked with the Drug Enforcement Agency?\nPenny: He didn\xe2\x80\x99t know it till he was cuffed, but yeah.\nSheldon: Hey, Leonard, if you\xe2\x80\x99re happy and you know it, no need to clap your hands, because I have an emotion detector.\nLeonard: How\xe2\x80\x99s it working out?\nSheldon: Surprisingly well.\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99s great, I\xe2\x80\x99m happy for you.\nSheldon: No, wait, uh, hold on. Oh, what, you are. Aren\xe2\x80\x99t you sweet?\nAmy: What\xe2\x80\x99s that? Are you working on your resume?\nPenny: No, it\xe2\x80\x99s my brother\xe2\x80\x99s. I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to help him get a job out here.\nSheldon: Oh, ooh! And that makes Leonard angry.\nLeonard: No, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t.\nSheldon: What, Leonard, please. I know an angry face when I see it. It\xe2\x80\x99s this red frowny guy on my phone.\nPenny: What? Are you really upset about Randall coming?\nLeonard: No.\nSheldon: Yes.\nLeonard: I said no.\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s like you\xe2\x80\x99re twins.\nPenny: Leonard, if you\xe2\x80\x99re mad about this, just tell me.\nLeonard: Fine. You invited your drug dealer brother to stay with us for God knows how long and didn\xe2\x80\x99t bother to ask me first.\nPenny: He\xe2\x80\x99s my brother. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t think I needed your permission.\nSheldon: Well, hey. Now she\xe2\x80\x99s angry, too. This thing works like gangbusters.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m not saying you have to ask my permission, but you could have talked to me about it before you said it was okay.\nPenny: Like you talked to me about your gaming room?\nLeonard: Our gaming room. I was gonna put a scented candle in it.\nSheldon: He\xe2\x80\x99s still mad.\nAmy: Stop enjoying their fight.\nSheldon: You first.\nPenny: If you were this upset, why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you say so when I told you?\nLeonard: Because I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to sound like a jerk.\nPenny: Well, you sound like one now. I don\xe2\x80\x99t see the big deal if my brother comes and stays for a while.\nLeonard: If you get him a job, he\xe2\x80\x99s gonna live here forever!\nPenny: He would get his own place.\nLeonard: Has he ever had his own place?\nPenny: Yes.\nLeonard: Did it have a metal toilet next to the bed?\nPenny: It still counts. You know, how is this any different from you making me live with Sheldon?\nSheldon: Hey, I shared my Honey Nut Cheerios with you.\nPenny: You gave me a bill at the end of every month.\nLeonard: Stay out of this. You and your stupid machine started this fight.\nSheldon: You are lucky that this feelings machine doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have feelings.\nAmy: Come on, Sheldon, let\xe2\x80\x99s go.\nSheldon: Gladly. Can we storm out?\nAmy: I think it loses its impact if we\xe2\x80\x99re chatting about it.\nSheldon: Fine. I\xe2\x80\x99ll just give them the finger.\nScene: Raj\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nRaj: Okay, first off, I want to thank you all so much for coming. Howard is here to interpret for Emily, and to take notes.\nHoward: No, he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s stupid.\nRaj: Uh, heads up, both of you are named Emily, so we\xe2\x80\x99ll call you red-headed Emily, and you, red-headed Emily, Junior.\nHoward: Hey, you went out with him. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t.\nRaj: Okay, uh, let\xe2\x80\x99s get things started. Um, why don\xe2\x80\x99t we go around the room, say your name, and why you broke up with me. Want to kick it off?\nLucy: Oh, okay. Um, I\xe2\x80\x99m Lucy, and I broke up with Raj because I have severe social anxiety, and he kept trying to force me into uncomfortable situations.\nHoward: Like this one?\nLucy: Yeah.\nRaj: I did do that. I can be insensitive to other people\xe2\x80\x99s boundaries. Howard, would you write that down?\nHoward: Schmuck. Got it.\nRaj: Uh, next?\nClaire: Okay. Um, I\xe2\x80\x99m Claire. And I guess I broke up with you because you were just really needy. Also, you were incredibly vain, like, all the time you spent shaping your eyebrows.\nRaj: Okay, new rule, everybody only gets one. Uh, next?\nEmily: Ooh, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure I\xe2\x80\x99m comfortable sharing details about our relationship in front of Howard.\nRaj: Oh. He\xe2\x80\x99s here to support me, so anything you have to say you can say in front of him.\nEmily: Okay. Well, whenever you and I were in bed\xe2\x80\xa6\nRaj: Howard, get out.\nHoward: Not a chance. So, you were telling us how Raj was terrible in bed.\nScene: Sheldon and Amy\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nAmy: Sheldon, dinner\xe2\x80\x99s ready. I made beef loaf, because I know you\xe2\x80\x99re uncomfortable with the non-specificity of meat loaf. Sheldon? Hey, are you okay?\nSheldon: Not really.\nAmy: What\xe2\x80\x99s going on?\nSheldon: I wish I never tried that device. And I know I said the same thing after the massage chair, but this time I mean it.\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry Leonard and Penny hurt your feelings.\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s more than that. It\xe2\x80\x99s me. I always knew I had trouble recognizing other people\xe2\x80\x99s emotions, but that machine just made it so real.\nAmy: Well, everybody has things that they need help with. Like me, I can\xe2\x80\x99t see without my glasses. And right now you\xe2\x80\x99re just a, a cute, pink smudge wearing a childish green smudge.\nSheldon: I thought I was getting better at it, but clearly I\xe2\x80\x99m not.\nAmy: Yes, you are. There have definitely been days when I was sad and you could tell.\nSheldon: Yeah, but that\xe2\x80\x99s shooting fish in a barrel. You\xe2\x80\x99re kind of a sad sack. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have said that. I\xe2\x80\x99m just upset.\nAmy: No, see, right there, you knew you hurt my feelings. And I\xe2\x80\x99m proud of you, for reasons I\xe2\x80\x99m sure have something to do with my father. And if you don\xe2\x80\x99t like that machine, get rid of it. Because I love you exactly the way you are.\nSheldon: I feel the same way about you. Now, put your glasses back on. You look weird.\nScene: Raj\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nHoward (translating for other Emily): I thought you were great, but, oh, my God, you were so dominated by your parents.\nEmily: Oh, yeah, that used to drive me nuts. He\xe2\x80\x99s kind of a mama\xe2\x80\x99s boy.\nClaire: Kind of?\nRaj: Okay, that\xe2\x80\x99s enough. Write down loving son.\nLucy: Can I just say something? Going out with Raj was one of the best things that ever happened to me.\nRaj: Yes, I\xe2\x80\x99ll take you back.\nLucy: Let me finish. It\xe2\x80\x99s like I needed to go through that experience to know what exactly I don\xe2\x80\x99t want in a man.\nRaj: Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s hard to hear, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll still take you back.\nEmily: You know, the same thing happened to me. After I broke up with Raj, I met Gary, who\xe2\x80\x99s just amazing.\nHoward: Sorry, is that Gary with one R or two?\nRaj: Would you stop writing? Wait, so, did all of you go on to better relationships after me?\nLucy: Oh, yeah.\nEmily: Without question.\nClaire: Little before, actually.\nHoward (responding to other Emily): Oh, wow. Don\xe2\x80\x99t let him get away.\nRaj: What did she say?\nHoward: Uh, basically, she traded you for Bruce Wayne.\nRaj: Okay, maybe we should just end this.\nHoward: Wait, hang on. I just want to point out to everyone here, this is a man who is going to great lengths to better himself. Even at the risk of being humiliated. And I, for one, think that\xe2\x80\x99s very brave.\nRaj: Thank you, Howard.\nEmily: Honestly, I\xe2\x80\x99m surprised you two didn\xe2\x80\x99t wind up together.\nHoward: Well, like you gals, I had to suffer through him to find Bernadette.\nScene: Sheldon and Amy\xe2\x80\x99s door.\nSheldon: Yes?\nLeonard: We owe you an apology.\nSheldon: Oh, it\xe2\x80\x99s fine. You needed a suitcase, I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t home, you borrowed a suitcase.\nLeonard: That was six years ago. I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about tonight.\nSheldon: Oh. Well, I thought we were going in order.\nPenny: Look, we got really angry at each other, and you just got caught in the middle of it.\nLeonard: And, sorry about the suitcase.\nSheldon: Yeah, well, you should be. Your socks were still in it. I had to throw it away. Anyway, I, uh, trust that you\xe2\x80\x99ve resolved your conflict.\nPenny: Yes, we\xe2\x80\x99re fine.\nLeonard: Mm, Penny\xe2\x80\x99s gonna call her dad and tell him it\xe2\x80\x99s not a good time for Randall to visit.\nPenny: Hopefully, he won\xe2\x80\x99t be too upset.\nLeonard: Oh, you\xe2\x80\x99re his little girl, he can\xe2\x80\x99t stay mad at you.\nPenny: He won\xe2\x80\x99t be mad at me. I mean, you\xe2\x80\x99re the one who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want my brother to come, so\xe2\x80\xa6\nLeonard: So you\xe2\x80\x99re gonna throw me under the bus?\nPenny: Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna throw you so hard, I might actually win a stuffed animal.\nSheldon: Uh, guys, it sounds like you\xe2\x80\x99re getting angry again.\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99s because we are.\nSheldon: Yes. I don\xe2\x80\x99t need an emotion machine. I am one.\nScene: Raj\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nHoward: Thanks, ladies, this was fun. Let\xe2\x80\x99s not wait so long for another bizarre, awkward night.\nRaj: Well, that was a waste of time. I\xe2\x80\x99m such an idiot.\nHoward: Don\xe2\x80\x99t beat yourself up. That\xe2\x80\x99s what I\xe2\x80\x99m here for.\nRaj: Maybe I won\xe2\x80\x99t settle down. Maybe I\xe2\x80\x99ll just play the field.\nHoward: Yeah, the field was just here. The field said no.\nRaj: Dude, come on.\nHoward: Okay, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what. I\xe2\x80\x99ll make you a deal. 30 years from now, if you\xe2\x80\x99re still single and things don\xe2\x80\x99t work out with me and Bernadette, you and I can give it a go.\nRaj: I appreciate the offer, but if things don\xe2\x80\x99t work out with you two, I\xe2\x80\x99m swooping in on her like a vulture.\nHoward: Too late. Stuart called dibs.\nRaj: But theoretically, if you and I were in a gay relationship, how would we tell people? Like, print up announcements?\nHoward: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. What difference does it make?\nRaj: Well, I want to make sure we get invited to all the parades.\nHoward: Those do look fun.\nRaj: Yeah. Well, if you want to march in a fishnet crop top, you better lay off that dip.\nHoward: If you didn\xe2\x80\x99t want me to eat it, why\xe2\x80\x99d you put it out?\nRaj: It was for the girls. They broke up with me, I don\xe2\x80\x99t care if they get fat.\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m not gonna get fat.\nRaj: Oh, you want to bet? You never exercise.\nHoward: Fine. Look, I\xe2\x80\x99ll exercise right now. One, two. These are crunches, by the way.\nRaj: Very mature. Keep eating like that, you\xe2\x80\x99re gonna have a heart attack.\nHoward: Okay. How about if I eat like this?\nRaj: You\xe2\x80\x99re such a child.\nHoward: Hey, is that any way to talk to your future husband?\nRaj: Hey, I was being hypothetical, okay? I would never marry you.\nHoward: Please. When you see the ring I pick out, you\xe2\x80\x99re gonna melt.\nRaj: Yeah, right. Wait, is it rose gold? Actually, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell me, I want to be surprised.\nScene: The apartment.\nPenny: So, did you wind up sending that machine back?\nSheldon: I did. You know, I\xe2\x80\x99m not even sure how accurate it was. I took it to the train store, it said everyone was sad.\nBernadette: I finally got Halley to sleep.\nRaj: You know, I just read a study that suggests new mothers are better at sensing emotions for up to two years.\nAmy: It\xe2\x80\x99s true. Pregnancy causes physiological changes in the brain that result in increased empathy.\nPenny: So, all we need to do is get Sheldon knocked up.\nLeonard: We can\xe2\x80\x99t. He was already fixed when I found him at the shelter.\nSheldon: Hey, uh, Bernadette, let\xe2\x80\x99s test this theory. What do you think I\xe2\x80\x99m feeling right now?\nBernadette: Let\xe2\x80\x99s see. You\xe2\x80\x99re better than us, a little bit sorry for us, but mostly glad you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to be us.\nSheldon: Keep filling this one with babies. She\xe2\x80\x99s good.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
