b'After a previously on sequence.\nScene: The apartment.\nPenny: What, what\xe2\x80\x99s all this?\nLeonard: Well, it sounded like you were having a rough day, so i wanted you to come home to something nice.\nPenny: Oh, that is so thoughtful.\nLeonard: Hey, do you remember when we went wine tasting in Santa Barbara and you said that was you\xe2\x80\x99d ever had?\nPenny: Yeah, i remember us driving up there, going to the winery and, that\xe2\x80\x99s it.\nLeonard: and this wine is why.\nPenny: Oh. Hey, what smells so good?\nLeonard: I made your favourite. Pizza bagels.\nPenny: Pink wine and pizza bagels? It\xe2\x80\x99s like eighth grade all over again. I am so lucky to have you.\nLeonard: Well, now be careful, these are hot. i could explain the thermodynamics of why the cheese seems hotter than the crust, but instead I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna keep it to myself.\nPenny: Oh, you always know what not to say. I just, i can\xe2\x80\x99t believe you did all this.\nLeonard: Well, you know, It\xe2\x80\x99s easy to take each other for granted and I never want to do that to you, because your love, it\xe2\x80\x99s like a river. It\xe2\x80\x99s peaceful and deep. Your soul is, it\xe2\x80\x99s like a secret that I could never keep.\nPenny: You did not just quote an Nsync song.\nLeonard: I quoted your favourite Nsync song.\nPenny: Oh.\nOut of daydream sequence.\nLeonard: Damn. I burped so hard, i died in my game.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The stairwell.\nSheldon: Leonard, i\xe2\x80\x99ve been meaning to ask you, what size shoe do you wear?\nLeonard: Why?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to take more of an interest in other people\xe2\x80\x99s lives.\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99s nice. I wear a size eight and a half.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s small. So, tell me, do you have any plans for the weekend?\nLeonard: Are you gonna laugh at the answer?\nSheldon: Only if the answer is shopping for baby shoes.\nLeonard: If you must know, Penny won a spa weekend from work, and she\xe2\x80\x99s taking me.\nSheldon: Oh, well you know, that is interesting. I wonder what kind of infection you\xe2\x80\x99ll come home with. My money\xe2\x80\x99s on fungal. They\xe2\x80\x99re still having girls night across the hall.\nLeonard: So, hang out with me and we\xe2\x80\x99ll have boys\xe2\x80\x99 night.\nSheldon: At our age, why don\xe2\x80\x99t we call it man\xe2\x80\x99s night?\nLeonard: Because we just spent our allowance on comic books.\nScene: Sheldon and Amy\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nAmy: Penny, is it weird that we\xe2\x80\x99re having girls\xe2\x80\x99 night here, but you don\xe2\x80\x99t live here any more, so it\xe2\x80\x99s basically my girls\xe2\x80\x99 night?\nPenny: I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t really thought about it.\nAmy: But now you\xe2\x80\x99re thinking about it and it bothers you? I get that.\nBernadette: Things going well with you and Sheldon living together?\nAmy: Better than ever. He asks about my day, takes an interest in my life. He\xe2\x80\x99s like my boyfriend in college, except he\xe2\x80\x99s real, so people can see him.\nBernadette: I\xe2\x80\x99ve been seeing him for years, I\xe2\x80\x99m still not convinced he\xe2\x80\x99s real.\nPenny: Hey, can I ask you a question? You\xe2\x80\x99ve been married for a while, is it normal for the husband to kind of completely stop giving a crap?\nBernadette: Uh oh, what\xe2\x80\x99s going on?\nPenny: Well, Leonard used to do all these things, like bring me flowers and wear pants.\nBernadette: It\xe2\x80\x99s okay, Howie never has on pants. The Domino\xe2\x80\x99s guy brings the pizza like this now.\nAmy: Well Sheldon always has his pants on. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I could pick his knees out of a line-up.\nPenny: Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s not just the pants, it\xe2\x80\x99s just, it\xe2\x80\x99s like since we got married he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t really try any more.\nAmy: Uh, Penny, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how to say this, but this is my first girls\xe2\x80\x99 night and you\xe2\x80\x99re kind of bumming everybody out.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s kitchen.\nHoward: All right, got Halley to sleep.\nRaj: Yeah, i heard you on the baby monitor. Didn\xe2\x80\x99t think you could think you could turn the theme from Walking Dead into a lullaby.\nHoward: Yeah, got to get her hooked on TV or someday she\xe2\x80\x99ll want me to play outside. Boy, that floor is so squeaky. I\xe2\x80\x99m surprised I didn\xe2\x80\x99t wake her up walking out of the room.\nRaj: Have you tried anything to fix it?\nHoward: Well, i put the rug down. It didn\xe2\x80\x99t help.\nRaj: I know. Blue shag, what were you thinking?\nHoward: Did try nailing a couple of the boards down.\nRaj: Did that do anything?\nHoward: Yeah, it left little holes in the floor, that\xe2\x80\x99s why I bought the rug.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: If you do that, i\xe2\x80\x99ll win in eight moves. I\xe2\x80\x99ll win in five moves. I\xe2\x80\x99ll win in one move.\nLeonard: Oh, no. Good game.\nPenny: Hey.\nLeonard: Hey.\nSheldon: Oh, Penny, I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to take an interest in other people. Uh, how was your girls\xe2\x80\x99 night?\nPenny: Oh, it was fine.\nSheldon: Hmm. Did you have anything to eat?\nPenny: Uh, chips.\nSheldon: Anything to drink?\nPenny: Some wine.\nSheldon: Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m just playing tennis against the drapes here.\nLeonard: Just ignore him.\nPenny: Hm. At least he took an interest.\nLeonard: What\xe2\x80\x99s that supposed to mean?\nPenny: Nothing.\nLeonard: Hey, what\xe2\x80\x99s going on with you?\nPenny: I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to talk about it.\nLeonard: Well, hey, come on, just tell me.\nPenny: Fine. Lately I kind of feel like you\xe2\x80\x99ve been taking me for granted.\nLeonard: What? Where is this coming from?\nSheldon: Leonard, she might be drunk. All she had was chips.\nPenny: It\xe2\x80\x99s just, since we got married you seem to think you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to try any more.\nLeonard: That is ridiculous.\nPenny: This is exactly why I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to talk about it.\nLeonard: No, no, no, no, let\xe2\x80\x99s talk about it. I\xe2\x80\x99m the one who\xe2\x80\x99s made all the effort in this relationship since day one. Please tell me what more I could do?\nPenny: Okay, you know what? Maybe I\xe2\x80\x99ll take Amy with me to the spa this weekend instead.\nLeonard: Fine, go ahead.\nSheldon: Amy is free. She had a harp lesson on Saturday but it got cancelled. Boy, when you take an interest in people, you really uncork a geyser of nonsense.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s kitchen.\nBernadette (on phone): Okay. Thanks, daddy. He said the only way to really fix an old floor like that is to tear it up and replace the whole thing.\nHoward: That sounds expensive.\nRaj: Hang on. No offence to her father, but he\xe2\x80\x99s not an MIT trained engineer. Thinking and building is what you do.\nHoward: MIT\xe2\x80\x99s motto is mind and hand, which just so happens was also my motto as a lonely teenager.\nRaj: Oh come on, we just need to be more creative. What if you didn\xe2\x80\x99t step on the floor at all? Like, what if you swung on a rope from the ceiling?\nHoward: No.\nRaj: Okay, um, okay, what if you rig up a pulley system and move yourself across the room in a harness?\nHoward: No.\nBernadette: I have one. What if you got a giant slingshot and flung yourself into the wall?\nHoward: Is that supposed to be funny?\nRaj: Hold on. Yeah, that\xe2\x80\x99s funny.\nScene: The apartment.\nPenny: All right, we\xe2\x80\x99re heading out.\nLeonard: Mm-hmm.\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99ll call you when we get to the hotel.\nSheldon: And if they have any of those tiny bottles of shampoo?\nAmy: I will bring them home so you can show me how Godzilla takes a shower.\nLeonard: Have fun.\nPenny: Thanks. Are you ready?\nAmy: Uh-huh. Bye, Sheldon.\nSheldon: You know what? I feel uncomfortable engaging in a public display of affection while their relationship is strained.\nLeonard: Go ahead, it\xe2\x80\x99s fine.\nSheldon: Bye.\nAmy: Bye.\nLeonard: Okay.\nPenny: Let\xe2\x80\x99s go.\nAmy: Bye.\nSheldon: Bye.\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99ll miss you.\nSheldon: Yeah, I\xe2\x80\x99ll miss you too.\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99ll miss you more.\nSheldon: Well, if x equals the amount that you\xe2\x80\x99ll miss me, then I\xe2\x80\x99ll miss you x plus one.\nAmy: If you miss me x plus one, I\xe2\x80\x99ll miss you open paren x plus one, close paren to the second\xe2\x80\xa6\nLeonard: Thank you.\nScene: The apartment, later.\nSheldon: Here. You\xe2\x80\x99re sad, so I made you tea.\nLeonard: Thanks.\nSheldon: And it\xe2\x80\x99s just the way you like it.\nLeonard: Earl grey?\nSheldon: Yes.\nLeonard: Honey?\nSheldon: Yes.\nLeonard: Unsweetened almond\xe2\x80\xa6\nSheldon: Good Lord, I made you tea, just drink it.\nLeonard: Sorry, thank you.\nSheldon: Well, what can we do to cheer you up?\nLeonard: I really don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\nSheldon: You want to play Jenga? Or, uh, Ticket to Ride? Hearthstone? What would you be the happiest losing at?\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to play a game, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Wow, and I remember when you loved playing games with me. Maybe Penny isn\xe2\x80\x99t the only relationship you\xe2\x80\x99re phoning in.\nLeonard: Its not that I\xe2\x80\x99d stopped trying, its just how relationships progress. They start with infatuation, but over time mellow into something more comfortable.\nSheldon: Hmm. Yeah, you\xe2\x80\x99re right. It\xe2\x80\x99s like when I first encountered the Pythagorean theorem. You know, I was blown away that the square of the hypotenuse was the sum of the squares of the opposite sides. But now I\xe2\x80\x99m just like, eh.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s nursery.\nHoward: Okay, this grid represents the room. All we need to do is plot out where each squeak is, and we can find a quiet path to the crib.\nRaj: It looks like a map from Dungeons and Dragons.\nHoward: Mm. Except the creature in the crib is a level-nine poop monster.\nRaj: Okay, uh, you check for squeaks, and I will mark them down.\nHoward: Okay, space A3, here we go. It\xe2\x80\x99s squeaking. Mark it.\nRaj: It\xe2\x80\x99s nice to think that you grew up in this room and now your daughter\xe2\x80\x99s going to as well.\nHoward: Mm. I hope she has the same amount of sex in it I did. None. Next square.\nRaj: Why do you bounce with your hands in the air like that?\nHoward: It\xe2\x80\x99s a tradition of my people. (Singing) If I were a rich man, ya ba dibba dibba dibba dibba dibba dibba dum.\nRaj: Material Girl needs ot be retired, that is your karaoke song.\nScene: Leonards car.\nSheldon: Would you like to play a driving game I invented?\nLeonard: Is it about the failing state of my relationship with Penny?\nSheldon: Never mind. You know, Penny went to this spa to be away from you. Are you sure you should be going there?\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to wait two days for us to work this out.\nSheldon: Very well. You got married spur of the moment, I don\xe2\x80\x99t see why your divorce should be any different.\nLeonard: I would pull this car over and kick you out, but If Penny dumps me, you\xe2\x80\x99re all I got.\nScene: The spa.\nPenny: When was the last time you got a massage?\nAmy: Sheldon walked on my back two weeks ago, but that was just \xe2\x80\x99cause there was a spider on his pillow and he was trying to get away.\nPenny: Leonard stood on me once, too, but he was just trying to see the Rose Parade.\nAmy: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the protocol, are you gonna be naked for your massage?\nPenny: Well, yeah.\nAmy: Hmm. Then this is probably too many clothes.\nLeonard: Hey.\nPenny: What are you doing here?\nLeonard: I came here to apologize.\nPenny: Okay. Leonard, I really appreciate that, but I need a little time to myself.\nLeonard: Okay. I don\xe2\x80\x99t get it, you said make an effort, here I am making an effort.\nSheldon: Hello, Amy. It\xe2\x80\x99s nice to see you.\nAmy: Nice to see you, too.\nSheldon: And that\xe2\x80\x99s how you make effort look effortless.\nPenny: All right. Can you please just go and we\xe2\x80\x99ll talk about this tomorrow?\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand what you want.\nPenny: I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to figure it out.\nSheldon: You know what? If you\xe2\x80\x99d like, I could whip up a quick relationship agreement. Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m at a spa, I might as well do something relaxing.\nAmy: Sheldon, why don\xe2\x80\x99t we give them some privacy?\nSheldon: Very well. Hey, later we\xe2\x80\x99ll check out the minibar, I\xe2\x80\x99ll show you how Godzilla gets drunk.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s nursery.\nHoward: So, what we did was map out the entire room to identify every squeak. Watch. It\xe2\x80\x99s easy,\nonce you get the hang of it. Step. Step. Hop onto Ottoman.\nRaj: Don\xe2\x80\x99t do that in socks, I almost broke my neck.\nHoward: Then simply sit, spin, stand, stretch, maybe in looser pants, then step, grab, tiny pivot, pull, and you\xe2\x80\x99re there. Easy peasy, mac and\xe2\x80\xa6 you get the idea.\nBernadette: You actually expect me to do this while holding a baby in the dark.\nRaj: Hold on, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think she was impressed.\nHoward: Bigger problems, I felt something pop.\nScene: The spa.\nSheldon: There\xe2\x80\x99s a cucumber in my water.\nAmy: Uh-huh.\nSheldon: Do they know it\xe2\x80\x99s there? I mean, should I tell somebody?\nAmy: It\xe2\x80\x99s there on purpose. It\xe2\x80\x99s refreshing.\nSheldon: Interesting. The world\xe2\x80\x99s most boring liquid and the world\xe2\x80\x99s most boring vegetable, but you put \xe2\x80\x99em together and bleugh.\nLeonard: Hey.\nPenny: Hey.\nSheldon: Oh good, you\xe2\x80\x99re here. Are you still fighting? If you get divorced, do I get two Christmas\xe2\x80\x99s?\nPenny: We\xe2\x80\x99re not getting divorced.\nLeonard: Listen, we realized, that, uh, we\xe2\x80\x99re facing some new challenges as a married couple.\nPenny: Yeah. And there are a few things we need to stay on top of. So we thought it would useful, and I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe I\xe2\x80\x99m about to say this, um.\nLeonard: Would you please help us make a relationship agreement? But one that\xe2\x80\x99s tailored to us, okay, we don\xe2\x80\x99t need a bathroom schedule.\nPenny: Although a rule about him texting me from in there might help with the romance.\nLeonard: What do you say?\nSheldon: I get to write a contract? I say, let\xe2\x80\x99s get this party of the first part started.\nPenny (after Amy laughs): Do you really think that\xe2\x80\x99s funny?\nAmy: It\xe2\x80\x99s in our agreement. I have to laugh.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: If you find this draft acceptable, then I believe your new relationship agreement is ready to be signed.\nPenny: Article 8, subsection B, Leonard will restrict videogaming in underpants to hours Penny is not home. This includes boxers, briefs, thongs, G-strings or anything else that calls attention to his pasty little thighs.\nLeonard: Does it really need to say that?\nSheldon: I did this for free, let me get a little something.\nLeonard: Article 10, subsection C, if questioned Penny may not say that everything is fine if it isn\xe2\x80\x99t. Other unacceptable responses include, it\xe2\x80\x99s nothing, don\xe2\x80\x99t worry about it, and, I said it\xe2\x80\x99s nothing don\xe2\x80\x99t worry about it.\nPenny: I think this all looks good.\nLeonard: Me, too.\nSheldon: Oh well, great then, here, you sign here, date here, and Penny, if you could initial here to indicate that you\xe2\x80\x99re accepting Leonard in as is condition.\nAmy: I remember signing our first relationship agreement.\nSheldon: Mm. You seem to be forgetting the no nostalgia clause.\nAmy: Right, right. Got it.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
