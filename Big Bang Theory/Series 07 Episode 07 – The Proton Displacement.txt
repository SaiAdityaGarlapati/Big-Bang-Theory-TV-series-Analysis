b'Scene: A supermarket\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen him this happy before.\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99s because you\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen him on restock the medicine cabinet day.\nSheldon: Look. A new topical antihistamine with lidocaine. Wow. I can\xe2\x80\x99t wait until I get a rash.\nLeonard: Oh, Gas-X has a new ultra strength. I guess they really do read their mail.\nSheldon: Hey, isn\xe2\x80\x99t that Professor Proton?\nLeonard: Oh, yeah.\nSheldon: Look at him, just standing in line like he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t moderately famous 30 years ago. Let\xe2\x80\x99s go say hello.\nLeonard: Oh, maybe we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t bother him.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to bother him, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to talk to him.\nLeonard: He thinks there\xe2\x80\x99s a difference.\nSheldon: Arthur? Arthur, it\xe2\x80\x99s me, Sheldon Cooper. You may not remember because of your advanced age.\nArthur: Trust me, I, I remember.\nSheldon: This is my girlfriend, Amy. Amy, this is television legend Arthur Jeffries. His science show inspired millions of children.\nArthur: Hold, hold, hold on. You, you have a girlfriend?\nAmy: Yes, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard so much about you. Hey look, we\xe2\x80\x99re wearing the same orthopaedic shoes. I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe I dress like a celebrity.\nArthur: Oh, okay, I get it now.\nLeonard: Dr. Jeffries, hello again. Leonard Hofstadter.\nArthur: Oh, oh, right, I remember your, your girlfriend. Is, is she, is she here?\nLeonard: No, she\xe2\x80\x99s not.\nSheldon: So, what prescription are you getting filled?\nLeonard: Sheldon.\nSheldon: No. Wait, I want to guess. Don\xe2\x80\x99t tell me.\nArthur: I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to tell you.\nAmy: Sheldon, come on.\nSheldon: No, no, no. I\xe2\x80\x99m really good at this. All right, give me a hint. Does it involve difficulty initiating a stream of anything?\nArthur: Well, given my age, that\xe2\x80\x99s more than just a lucky guess.\nLeonard: Hey, Sheldon, let\xe2\x80\x99s go mock the people buying homeopathic medicine, you love that.\nSheldon: But I\xe2\x80\x99m hanging out with my friend, and we\xe2\x80\x99re having fun. Look how happy he is.\nCredits sequence.\nThe cafeteria.\nHoward: Bernie\xe2\x80\x99s having a girls\xe2\x80\x99 night on Friday at our place. You want to do something?\nRaj: Actually, I\xe2\x80\x99m busy.\nHoward: Doing what?\nRaj: There\xe2\x80\x99s a new sports bar over on Colorado Ave\xe2\x80\xa6\nHoward: You\xe2\x80\x99re going to girls\xe2\x80\x99 night.\nRaj: Yeah.\nHoward: You know they\xe2\x80\x99re making jewellery right?\nRaj: You think they came up with that? They were going to drink beer and play darts.\nLeonard: What\xe2\x80\x99s up?\nHoward: Not his testosterone levels.\nRaj: Excuse me. I happen to be very comfortable with my masculinity.\nHoward: How is that possible?\nLeonard: Hey, I got an email from Professor Proton.\nSheldon: Goody. What\xe2\x80\x99s it say?\nLeonard: He\xe2\x80\x99s working on a paper about nano vacuum tubes, and wants to know if I\xe2\x80\x99d take a look at it.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s strange. That he would come to you for that and not me. Oh, I got two emails from him. Do you have Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s email address? And. Never mind, I found it. I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe he picked you over me.\nHoward: You don\xe2\x80\x99t want to read a paper by some old has-been who hasn\xe2\x80\x99t done any real science in decades.\nRaj: Yeah, it\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to cry about.\nSheldon: Sheldon Cooper does not cry.\nHoward: It\xe2\x80\x99s true, you\xe2\x80\x99d rust.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: And to think I idolized that man. And why? At the end of the day he\xe2\x80\x99s just another Hollywood phony.\nAmy: Is it really worth getting upset about?\nSheldon: Yeah, they say don\xe2\x80\x99t meet your heroes. Don\xe2\x80\x99t peek behind that curtain of fame and celebrity, because if you do, you\xe2\x80\x99ll see them as they really are, degenerate carnival folk.\nAmy: Come on, he\xe2\x80\x99s a retired kids show host.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s even worse. Using the sweet candy of science to trick children into loving him. Pervert.\nAmy: Have you ever thought about why Arthur didn\xe2\x80\x99t want you to read his paper?\nSheldon: Yes, I have. And my only conclusion is the prescription he was picking up the other day was for cuckoo pills.\nAmy: Maybe he found you, um, a bit much.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s kind of a stretch. Look, when it comes to social skills, I\xe2\x80\x99ve mastered the big three. There\xe2\x80\x99s the coy smile. There\xe2\x80\x99s the friendly chuckle. There\xe2\x80\x99s the vocalization of sympathy. Aw. That last one\xe2\x80\x99s tricky, I\xe2\x80\x99m still working on it.\nAmy: From what I saw the other day, I could understand why he and some people might find you\xe2\x80\xa6\nSheldon: What?\nAmy: Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter.\nSheldon: No, go ahead, say it. I know what it is. I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard it my whole life. The word\xe2\x80\x99s annoying. Go ahead, say it. Say it. Say I\xe2\x80\x99m annoying.\nAmy: Sheldon.\nSheldon: Oh, it won\xe2\x80\x99t hurt my feelings. Go ahead, Amy, say I\xe2\x80\x99m annoying. I\xe2\x80\x99m annoying. I\xe2\x80\x99m annoying. I\xe2\x80\x99m annoying. Yeah, now, uh, now where are you going? Look, you know you want to say it, say it. Say I\xe2\x80\x99m annoying. Go ahead, say it. Say it. Say it. Amy, say it. Well, she can\xe2\x80\x99t stand it when I\xe2\x80\x99m right.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nAmy: This is fun. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to feel like such a vixen wearing jewellery that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have a list of medications I\xe2\x80\x99m allergic to.\nRaj: Penny, how\xe2\x80\x99s it going over there?\nPenny: Good, I\xe2\x80\x99m just having little trouble with the glue.\nAmy: How do you not know how to use glue? Did you ditch pre-school?\nPenny: Yeah, but only because I was dating a second grader.\nHoward: Hello, everyone.\nRaj: Okay, let me have it. Let\xe2\x80\x99s hear all the Raj is a girl jokes.\nHoward: Nope. Bernadette told me it isn\xe2\x80\x99t nice and I\xe2\x80\x99m not allowed.\nRaj: Thank you.\nHoward: So I won\xe2\x80\x99t be making fun of you, or the things you like, or the fact that you just want to have fu-un.\nBernadette: Howie, stop. Come on, look at what I\xe2\x80\x99m making.\nHoward: Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s actually pretty nice.\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99m making a bracelet.\nPenny: Yeah, I\xe2\x80\x99m just making a mess.\nHoward: You know, instead of beads and glue, you guys can use my soldering iron. You\xe2\x80\x99d be able to make much cooler stuff.\nRaj: Oh, I think we\xe2\x80\x99re doing just fine, thank you.\nAmy: Actually, I\xe2\x80\x99d kind of like to try that.\nBernadette: Me, too.\nHoward: Be right back.\nPenny: When did I have pistachios?\nScene: Professor Proton\xe2\x80\x99s house.\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Arthur. (Knock, knock, knock) Arthur. (Knock, knock, knock) Arthur. Door knocker. That\xe2\x80\x99s TV money.\nArthur: Sheldon, what are you doing here?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, did I wake you?\nArthur: Of course you woke me, it\xe2\x80\x99s seven thirty.\nSheldon: Well, I would have been here sooner, but for some reason your home isn\xe2\x80\x99t on this map of Hollywood stars.\nArthur: What do you want, Sheldon?\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s been pointed out by my girlfriend that I may have been annoying to you.\nArthur: She sounds like a keeper.\nSheldon: Anyway, I wanted to apologize. I am truly sorry.\nArthur: All right, apology accepted. Have a nice night.\nSheldon: No, no, now that we\xe2\x80\x99ve cleared the air, I wanted to discuss another matter with you.\nArthur: Sheldon, in a couple hours I have to get up, pee and then wander around the house.\nSheldon: Well, then, I\xe2\x80\x99ll make this quick. Um, I want to talk about the paper you sent Leonard. Now, I know he said it\xe2\x80\x99s promising and he\xe2\x80\x99s going to collaborate on it, but now that you and I are friends again, I am at your disposal. And, um, frankly, lending my name and reputation to it will help, because a lot of people think that you\xe2\x80\x99re a washed-up has-been. Or dead.\nArthur: I should be so lucky.\nSheldon: So, uh, what do you say?\nArthur: You know, if it\xe2\x80\x99s all the same with you, I, I think I\xe2\x80\x99ll, I\xe2\x80\x99ll stick with Leonard.\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s because I\xe2\x80\x99m annoying, right? I know it is. Say it. Say it. Say I\xe2\x80\x99m annoying.\nArthur: Good night.\nSheldon: Say it. Arthur, say it. Say I\xe2\x80\x99m annoying. Say it. Say it. I\xe2\x80\x99m annoying. Say it.\nArthur: You\xe2\x80\x99re annoying.\nSheldon: Well, that really hurt.\nScene: Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s laboratory.\nLeonard: If you would have told me when I was a kid that someday I would be doing science next to Professor Proton, I would not have believed you.\nArthur: If someone had told me that people would still call me Professor Proton when I was 83 years old, I never would have quit smoking.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, Dr. Jeffries, I\xe2\x80\x99m just excited. This nano vacuum tube idea of yours is, it\xe2\x80\x99s really interesting.\nSheldon: Hello, Leonard. Oh, hello, Arthur. What an odd coincidence that you\xe2\x80\x99re both here.\nLeonard: Why is it odd?\nSheldon: Because as it just so happens, I\xe2\x80\x99m also spending the day with a beloved children\xe2\x80\x99s television science personality. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that right, new friend and colleague Bill Nye the Science Guy. Sorry, I replaced you with a newer model.\nBill Nye: Wow, Arthur Jeffries. It\xe2\x80\x99s an honour to meet you. My show never would have happened without yours.\nArthur: That\xe2\x80\x99s what I told my lawyers.\nLeonard: Mr. Nye, hello. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry he got you involved in this nonsense.\nBill: He said I\xe2\x80\x99d be speaking to a class.\nSheldon: No, I said you were teaching someone a lesson. Now let\xe2\x80\x99s go.\nBill: What are you guys working on?\nLeonard: Oh, uh, we\xe2\x80\x99re making nano vacuum tubes.\nBill: Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s interesting.\nArthur: Haven\xe2\x80\x99t you stolen enough from me? Back off, bow tie.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nPenny: Hey, guys, what do you think?\nAmy: Wow, Penny, good job.\nPenny: Thanks. Target, four ninety-nine. I\xe2\x80\x99m getting a drink.\nAmy: What are you working on?\nRaj: Ah, I\xe2\x80\x99m making a necklace for my mom.\nAmy: That\xe2\x80\x99s sweet.\nRaj: Yeah, she and my dad are going through a bit of a rough patch, so I wanted to do something to let her know I was thinking about her.\nPenny: What\xe2\x80\x99s going on with them?\nRaj: They\xe2\x80\x99re just having a little trouble communicating. My dad says it\xe2\x80\x99s because the sound of my mom\xe2\x80\x99s voice makes him want to tear his ears off and sew them over his eyes so he never has to look at her again.\nBernadette: Hi.\nPenny: Hey, guys.\nAmy: Hello.\nHoward: Look who\xe2\x80\x99s here to put the Jew in jewellery night.\nBernadette: Oh, sure, so it\xe2\x80\x99s fine when you say it.\nHoward: Sorry we\xe2\x80\x99re late. I wanted to swing by the lab and pick up some even cooler tools for us to use.\nRaj: I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know you were coming again.\nHoward: Well, last week was a blast. Plus, I thought you might like having a guy here.\nPenny (laughing): It was not funny.\nAmy: So, what tools did you bring?\nHoward: Everything we need to make jewellery moulds. Here\xe2\x80\x99s some silver, a crucible and an acetylene torch to melt it down.\nPenny: Ooh, that looks like fun.\nBernadette: Maybe you should master glue before you move on to fire.\nHoward: Okay, who\xe2\x80\x99s up first?\nAmy: Rajesh, do you want to make a bracelet for your mom to go with the necklace?\nRaj: No, thanks.\nHoward: I was gonna make a necklace for my mom, but unfortunately she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have a neck. She\xe2\x80\x99s just chins and fat and feet.\nScene: Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s laboratory.\nLeonard: Okay, we\xe2\x80\x99re almost ready to go. Once we bond the wires, we can test the tubes.\nArthur: This is so exciting, I, I feel like I\xe2\x80\x99m 75 again.\nLeonard: Oh, God.\nArthur: What, what is it?\nLeonard: Sheldon just sent me a picture of him and Bill Nye getting smoothies.\nArthur: Can, can I ask you a question?\nLeonard: Yeah, sure.\nArthur: Why do you put up with Sheldon?\nLeonard: Oh, uh, you know, because we\xe2\x80\x99re friends.\nArthur: Why?\nLeonard: Wow, you ask really hard questions.\nArthur: Yeah.\nLeonard: Look, I know he can be aggravating, but what you have to remember is that he\xe2\x80\x99s not doing it on purpose. It\xe2\x80\x99s just how he is. But he\xe2\x80\x99s also loyal and trustworthy and we have fun together.\nArthur: You, you know you\xe2\x80\x99re describing a dog.\nLeonard: He did bite me once. But in his defence, I came up behind him while he was eating, so\xe2\x80\xa6\nArthur: Yeah, they, they hate that.\nLeonard: You know what, Sheldon is the smartest person I have ever met. And he\xe2\x80\x99s a little broken and he needs me. I guess I need him, too.\nArthur: Why, why is that?\nLeonard: Boy, you will not let this go, will you? Oh, jeez.\nArthur: Another photo from Sheldon?\nLeonard: No, I have to go pick him up. Bill Nye ditched him at the smoothie place.\nArthur: He probably stole his wallet, too.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nHoward: You know, if you guys are interested, there\xe2\x80\x99s a technique where I can take a lock of your hair, refine it into carbon dust and use the hydraulic press at work to turn it into a tiny little diamond with your DNA in it.\nPenny: Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s amazing,\nHoward: Yeah. See Bernie\xe2\x80\x99s engagement ring? That came right off my mom\xe2\x80\x99s back.\nBernadette: He\xe2\x80\x99s kidding. If that were true, it\xe2\x80\x99d be so much bigger.\nRaj: My name is Howard. I can make your hair into diamonds. My mom is morbidly obese. Everybody love me.\nHoward: Whoa, where is that coming from?\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you where it\xe2\x80\x99s coming from. All you do is make fun of me for coming to girls\xe2\x80\x99 night and now you\xe2\x80\x99re here ruining it for everyone.\nPenny: Raj, cool it, he\xe2\x80\x99s gonna make us hair diamonds.\nHoward: How am I ruining anything? I\xe2\x80\x99m just trying to help you make better jewellery.\nRaj: But this isn\xe2\x80\x99t about the jewellery. This is about me having a place where I can open up about my feelings.\nHoward: Since when can\xe2\x80\x99t you open up with me?\nRaj: There are just some things that I feel more comfortable sharing with the girls, because they won\xe2\x80\x99t make fun of me or and call me names, or ask me if my Koothrapanties are in a bunch.\nHoward: Buddy, I was just joking around.\nRaj: Yeah, well, sometimes your jokes hurt.\nHoward: You\xe2\x80\x99re right. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t realize I was making you feel that way. It was very brave of you to tell me.\nRaj: Thank you. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t easy.\nAmy: They\xe2\x80\x99re gonna have sex before Sheldon and I do, I know it.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Arthur?\nArthur: Hi, Sheldon.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m surprised to see you here.\nArthur: Yeah, me, too. Somewhere around the third floor I began to see a, a white light.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99ll get Leonard.\nArthur: No, no, no, I\xe2\x80\x99m, I\xe2\x80\x99m here, I\xe2\x80\x99m here to see you.\nSheldon: If you\xe2\x80\x99re hoping to get in touch with Bill Nye, I can\xe2\x80\x99t help you. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been informed that he\xe2\x80\x99s now Bill Nye the Restraining Order Guy.\nArthur: No, I, I, I was thinking, if it isn\xe2\x80\x99t too much trouble, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to get your opinion about my, my paper.\nSheldon: Thank you. It would be an honour.\nArthur: Oh. Uh, great.\nSheldon: Actually, I don\xe2\x80\x99t need that. I hacked into your e-mail account and read it.\nArthur: And, what did you think?\nSheldon: Well, first, I think the fact that you use your birthday as a password is embarrassing.\nArthur: Mmm. Thank you.\nSheldon: Second, um, I thought your paper was inspired.\nArthur: Oh, well, that, that means a lot to me.\nSheldon: Can I invite you in for tea?\nArthur: Uh, no, no. I, I really, I have, I have to run.\nPenny: Hey, Arthur. How are you?\nArthur: Well, I guess one cup wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t hurt.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nHoward: Oh, hey, buddy, what\xe2\x80\x99s up?\nRaj: Well, I was feeling bad about how I acted the other night so I made you a little something.\nHoward: You didn\xe2\x80\x99t have to do that.\nRaj: Well, it was fun. I used some of the jewellery techniques you taught us. It\xe2\x80\x99s a lightsabre belt buckle.\nHoward: Wow, this is so cool. Thanks.\nRaj: Oh gets better.\nHoward: Wow.\nRaj: And that\xe2\x80\x99s not even the best part. See? I have one, too. Check it out. You can wear yours and we can have little sword fights whenever we want.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Yeah, and my eighth favourite episode of Professor Proton was Alka-Seltzer rocket. You said, plop, plop, fizz, fizz, oh, what a blast-off it is. Remember? Remember that? Remember?\nLeonard: He can\xe2\x80\x99t help it. He can\xe2\x80\x99t. He really can\xe2\x80\x99t.\nSheldon: Oh, wait here. I\xe2\x80\x99ll get some Alka-Seltzer, we can build that rocket, and we can shoot it at Bill Nye\xe2\x80\x99s house. As long as I\xe2\x80\x99m not within 500 feet of it.\nArthur: So, you, uh, you have, you have any, single grandmothers?\nPenny: Sorry, they\xe2\x80\x99re both married.\nArthur: Good.\nPenny: Mmm.\nArthur: Hap, hap, happily?\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
