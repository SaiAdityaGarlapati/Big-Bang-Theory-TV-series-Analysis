b'After a \xe2\x80\x9cpreviously on\xe2\x80\x9d sequence\xe2\x80\xa6\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s van.\nHoward: Oh, man, this is really happening. You doin\xe2\x80\x99 okay?\nBernadette: Here comes another contraction.\nStuart: Let\xe2\x80\x99s pick it up.\nRaj: All right, hold on. I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna drive like we do in India. Get out of my way, you syphilitic dogs.\nHoward: Stop that, this isn\xe2\x80\x99t India.\nRaj: Fine. What do one point three billion people know about having babies?\nHoward: Sorry. I know you were just trying to help. I love you.\nRaj: I love you, too. We\xe2\x80\x99re good.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: Sheldon and Amy\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom.\nSheldon: Amy? Wake up.\nAmy: What\xe2\x80\x99s wrong?\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s midnight. Happy birthday.\nAmy: Sheldon. Okay, you can have this back in the morning.\nSheldon: This is for you. I was going to wrap it, but touching Scotch tape gives me the heebie-jeebies.\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99ll put in on the list with peaches and felt. What is this?\nSheldon: A functional MRI of my brain. I did Sudoku before they took it so I\xe2\x80\x99d be ripped.\nAmy: I love it. Thank you.\nSheldon: And it\xe2\x80\x99s not just an MRI. The orbitofrontal cortex is lit up because I was thinking of you.\nAmy: Sheldon.\nSheldon: We seem to be moving on to the annual coitus portion of your birthday festivities.\nAmy: Is that okay?\nSheldon: I didn\xe2\x80\x99t put on my come-hither plaid PJ\xe2\x80\x99s for nothing.\nAmy: You hate Scotch tape, but you love Scotch plaid. You are a mystery.\nPenny (off): Guys, wake up. Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s having her baby.\nLeonard (off): Come on, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to the hospital.\nAmy: I guess, I guess we should stop.\nSheldon: Yeah. I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid so. Childbirth, looming coitus? This is a banner night for female genitals.\nScene: A delivery room.\nMidwife: Now I see three of you. Do we know the father, or is this some Mamma Mia nonsense?\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m the father.\nMidwife: Okay, Dad, how far apart are the contractions?\nHoward: No idea. Ask him.\nRaj: 12 minutes.\nMidwife: 12 minutes? Why are you here?\nStuart: Aren\xe2\x80\x99t we supposed to get here an hour and a half early?\nMidwife: This is a hospital, not the airport.\nBernadette: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. It\xe2\x80\x99s our first time.\nMidwife: It\xe2\x80\x99s okay. This little one will be here before you know it. Do we know what we\xe2\x80\x99re having?\nHoward: No, we\xe2\x80\x99re keeping it a surprise.\nMidwife: Old school. Nice.\nBernadette: Not that old school. He knows.\nRaj: You see, I was at the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s office, the folder was right there, so I took a peek.\nHoward: And talking like this doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make it less creepy.\nMidwife: Sweetheart, go home. Come back when the contractions are five minutes apart for an hour.\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, that\xe2\x80\x99s ambiguous. Is it five minutes apart starting at the top of the hour, or five minutes apart starting with the first contraction, so essentially, like, 65 minutes?\nMidwife: I\xe2\x80\x99m just throwing this out there, but home births are very popular these days.\nScene: The stairwell.\nPenny: Sheldon, what took you so long?\nSheldon: Wolowitz might hand out cigars. I had to find my bubble gum cigar so I could join in without looking foolish.\nLeonard: Damn, I need my inhaler.\nAmy: Just don\xe2\x80\x99t smoke.\nLeonard: No, I went down the stairs too fast.\nPenny (answering phone): Hey.\nRaj: Don\xe2\x80\x99t come to the hospital. We\xe2\x80\x99re headed home.\nPenny: Oh, that was fast. Did she sneeze the baby out?\nBernadette: We showed up too early. We\xe2\x80\x99ll keep you posted.\nPenny: Okay, well, we\xe2\x80\x99ll talk to you guys later. Bye. She said not to come. It\xe2\x80\x99s gonna be a while.\nAmy: Well, first deliveries can be slow.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m starting to rethink the Flash onesie I bought this kid.\nLeonard: I found it, but it\xe2\x80\x99s empty.\nPenny: Well, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter. We\xe2\x80\x99re not going to the hospital now.\nLeonard: Are you sure? I\xe2\x80\x99d really like to.\nAmy: Well, should we, uh, head back up?\nPenny: Well while we\xe2\x80\x99re all awake, why don\xe2\x80\x99t we go to a diner or something?\nAmy: Oh, uh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Sheldon, you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to do that, do you?\nSheldon: It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter what I want. It\xe2\x80\x99s your birthday, you decide.\nPenny: Oh, my God. It\xe2\x80\x99s your birthday. Let\xe2\x80\x99s do something fun.\nAmy: Uh.\nPenny: We could go to a bar.\nAmy: Well.\nLeonard: Okay, I can breathe again. Babe, they want to have sex.\nPenny: Oh, of course. The annual birthday booty spectacular!\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s a bit childish, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\nPenny: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, and what flavour is your bubble gum cigar?\nSheldon: Grape. I find it the most mild.\nPenny: All right, well, you two go have fun.\nLeonard: If we find my backup inhaler, maybe we can get frisky.\nPenny: Oh, you sexy, wheezy little man.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s kitchen.\nBernadette: Do you really need to record this?\nRaj: You\xe2\x80\x99ll be happy I did. Okay, little one, here we are back at home because you weren\xe2\x80\x99t quite ready to come out yet. You wanted to make an entrance. I get it. And here\xe2\x80\x99s your daddy. When he tries to tell you he used to be cool, you can see he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t.\nHoward: All right, enough with the camera.\nRaj: Well, this is not for me, this is for the baby. Some day she\xe2\x80\x99s gonna want to see this.\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, who\xe2\x80\x99s gonna want to see this?\nRaj: I, I said she, but lot\xe2\x80\x99s of things are she, boats and cars, whales, like thar she blows!\nStuart: You\xe2\x80\x99re doing great.\nBernadette: Raj.\nRaj: Well, okay, I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna sign off now. This next part may contain some adult language.\nBernadette: How could you?\nHoward: We made it this far without knowing, and you\xe2\x80\x99ve ruined it.\nRaj: Well, you guys have no idea how hard it is to know something like this and not say it.\nStuart: You told me it was a girl, and I didn\xe2\x80\x99t say it.\nBernadette: Raj.\nRaj: You were supposed to keep that to yourself.\nStuart: Oh, yeah. I guess it is hard.\nScene: Sheldon and Amy\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom.\nAmy: So, where were we?\nSheldon: Well, I believe we were kissing like randy teenagers, and your nose was whistling ever so slightly.\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.\nSheldon: Oh, don\xe2\x80\x99t be. You were like a foxy tea kettle.\nAmy: Well, shall we start over?\nSheldon: Very well.\nAmy: What\xe2\x80\x99s wrong?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure. Earlier tonight, things began organically, and now it\xe2\x80\x99s feeling forced, like all the Pirates of the Caribbean sequels.\nAmy: Okay, that makes sense. I mean, the mood\xe2\x80\x99s a little different now. We, we don\xe2\x80\x99t have to rush.\nSheldon: Oh, I know, but just, Leonard and Penny think we\xe2\x80\x99re doing it, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to disappoint them.\nAmy: And the mood continues to change.\nSheldon: No, and also, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to disappoint you. I, you know, come on, it\xe2\x80\x99s your birthday. I can soldier through this.\nAmy: Hold on. I think I might have a little surprise that might help get things back on track.\nSheldon: Intriguing. Is back on track a hint that it has something to do with trains?\nAmy: No.\nSheldon: Because if it did have to do with trains, and you were gonna give\xe2\x80\xa6\nAmy: It\xe2\x80\x99s not about trains.\nSheldon: Not even a cozy sleeper car on the Orient Express?\nAmy: Stop talking about trains.\nSheldon: Who\xe2\x80\x99s killing the mood now?\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: Found the backup inhaler, want to have sex?\nPenny: Well, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t until I heard that.\nLeonard: Hang on. I\xe2\x80\x99m counting. It\xe2\x80\x99s okay.\nRaj (off): Hello. Howard and Bernadette kicked me out because I told them they\xe2\x80\x99re having a girl. Oopsy, I did it again.\nPenny: Maybe if we\xe2\x80\x99re quiet, he\xe2\x80\x99ll go away.\nRaj: You\xe2\x80\x99re gonna have to be quieter than that.\nScene: Sheldon and Amy\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom.\nSheldon: Can I look yet?\nAmy: One second. All right, you can open your eyes. I thought I\xe2\x80\x99d let Harry Potter make things hotter.\nSheldon: Wowza.\nAmy: I got a Gryffindor robe for you.\nSheldon: What, a Gryffindor sleeping with a Hufflepuff? How scandalous. You naughty girl, you went to the Wizarding World theme park without me.\nAmy: I did. Am I in trouble?\nSheldon: Yes, you\xe2\x80\x99re in trouble, you went to Wizarding World without me.\nAmy: Wait, what just happened?\nSheldon: You know I\xe2\x80\x99ve been wanting to go.\nAmy: Sheldon, do you really want to argue with me on my birthday?\nSheldon: Oh, you\xe2\x80\x99re right. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.\nAmy: Ooh. Happy birthday to me.\nRaj (off): Hello.\nAmy: Is this about the baby?\nRaj: No. People just keep kicking me out everywhere I go.\nAmy: Good. Then you\xe2\x80\x99re used to this.\nPenny: Hey, Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s water broke.\nLeonard: Come on, everyone to the hospital.\nAmy: You have got to be kidding me.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s van.\nHoward: Just try to relax, we\xe2\x80\x99ll be there any minute. Stuart, stop driving like an old man. Speed it up a little.\nStuart: I\xe2\x80\x99m not an old man, I just can\xe2\x80\x99t see at night.\nBernadette: Here comes another one. Hey, Squinty, the gas pedal\xe2\x80\x99s on the right.\nStuart: All right, hang on. If you see any pedestrians, just call \xe2\x80\x99em out.\nScene: Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s car.\nPenny: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s kid might be born on your birthday. How cool is that?\nAmy: :21,369 \xe2\x80\x93> 00:12:23,536\nYeah, but I thought this\nbaby was supposed to ruin their sex life, not mine.\nRaj: This is not how I imagined this day going, I should be with them right now.\nLeonard: Well, it is their child.\nRaj: I know that. But to be fair, I\xe2\x80\x99ve spent nine months helping Bernadette get ready for this baby, and Howard spent five minutes conceiving it. And I\xe2\x80\x99m being generous.\nSheldon: Five minutes? We must be doing it wrong. It took us hours.\nRaj: And, and the worst part is that they kicked me out and let Stuart stay.\nAmy: I understand, but this is a special day for them. Can you just try and let it go?\nSheldon: She\xe2\x80\x99s right. You know, I just learned Amy went to a theme park without me, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to ruin her birthday. I\xe2\x80\x99ll wait, and ruin 24 individual hours sprinkled throughout the year. Boop.\nScene: The delivery suite.\nHoward: Deep breaths, slow breaths.\nBernadette: I\xe2\x80\x99m so thirsty. Give me more ice chips.\nStuart: Sorry. I thought these were room ice chips. I\xe2\x80\x99ll go get some more.\nHoward: Uh, Stuart, while you\xe2\x80\x99re out there, don\xe2\x80\x99t come back.\nStuart: Okay.\nHoward: So, what are we gonna name this kid? Now that we know she\xe2\x80\x99s a girl, it kind of ruins my plan for Wally Wolowitz.\nBernadette: We could name her after your mom.\nHoward: Debbie? No. She hated that name.\nBernadette: Did she have a middle name?\nHoward: Melvina.\nBernadette: Let\xe2\x80\x99s keep thinking.\nHoward: Ah. It sucks that she\xe2\x80\x99s not here.\nBernadette: I know.\nHoward: Hm. She would\xe2\x80\x99ve been the best grandma.\nBernadette: She did always have candy in her pocket.\nHoward: Yeah. I was 20 years old before I figured out Tootsie Rolls weren\xe2\x80\x99t naturally warm.\nBernadette: I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know her five minutes and she asked, are you a Milky Way or a Snickers girl?\nHoward: Thank God you answered right, we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be here today.\nScene: The waiting room.\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to believe Howard\xe2\x80\x99s having a kid.\nAmy: Yeah. Penny, you\xe2\x80\x99re the one who introduced him to Bernie.\nPenny: How many times do I have to say I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry?\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s not just Howard and Bernadette. I mean, look how far we\xe2\x80\x99ve all come.\nStuart: Hmm. You two got married.\nAmy: Sheldon and I are living together.\nSheldon: But if my mom asks, we have bunk beds.\nLeonard: Penny was a struggling actress when we met, and now she\xe2\x80\x99s a successful pharmaceutical rep.\nPenny: Okay, you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to say struggling every time. You can just say actress.\nStuart: Howard went to space.\nAmy: Bernadette got her doctorate.\nLeonard: Sheldon, Howard and I are working with the government on our quantum gyroscope.\nAmy: We\xe2\x80\x99ve all come a long way. There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot to be proud of.\nRaj: For God\xe2\x80\x99s sake, just drive in the knife, why don\xe2\x80\x99t you.\nStuart: What\xe2\x80\x99s your problem?\nRaj: Well, you\xe2\x80\x99re all thinking it, I\xe2\x80\x99m the only one who hasn\xe2\x80\x99t done anything worthwhile.\nSheldon: I was not thinking it. Although, now that you point it out, it is undeniable.\nStuart: Raj, if it\xe2\x80\x99s any consolation, I\xe2\x80\x99m no better off than I was ten years ago.\nRaj: Oh, yay, I have a doctorate in astrophysics and I\xe2\x80\x99m every bit as awesome as the pasty-faced owner of a comic book store.\nSheldon: Raj, show some compassion. Those are things that we think but don\xe2\x80\x99t say.\nRaj: Excuse me.\nLeonard: Sorry, Stuart.\nStuart: Hey, I\xe2\x80\x99m in a hospital and I\xe2\x80\x99m not the patient. I\xe2\x80\x99m fine.\nScene: The delivery suite.\nHoward: Come on, Bernie, breathe. Remember what you learned in birthing class.\nBernadette: I remember thinking this is stupid, and I was right.\nHoward: Do you want me to get the nurse?\nBernadette: No. If one more person puts their fingers near my uterus, I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna cross my legs and snap \xe2\x80\x99em off.\nScene: The waiting room.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99ve come to peace with my relationship with my parents. That was a big milestone for me.\nSheldon: Oh, speaking of personal growth, I recently tried eating Swiss chard. You know, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t swallow it, but Amy said it counted.\nRaj: Hey.\nStuart: Hey. Still a loser or did you turn things around while you were gone?\nPenny: You know, Raj, honey, you\xe2\x80\x99re being too hard on yourself. When I first met you, you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t even talk to women. I mean, you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t even talk if one was in the room.\nRaj: Oh, great, now I can say things like I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe you\xe2\x80\x99re breaking up with me, why are you breaking up with me? Yes, I\xe2\x80\x99ll still help you move.\nPenny: Anyone else want to try?\nStuart: Uh, yeah, I got something. Raj, not everybody could be a dog owner. Oh, what? Did your doggie break up with you too?\nPenny: Hey, I bought M&Ms at the vending machine and two bags came out.\nRaj: I bought the first one, it didn\xe2\x80\x99t fall.\nPenny: Here.\nHoward: She\xe2\x80\x99s here, the baby\xe2\x80\x99s here.\nPenny: Oh!\nRaj: Congratulations.\nAmy: How\xe2\x80\x99s Bernadette?\nHoward: Tired, but great. They\xe2\x80\x99re both great.\nPenny: Does the baby have a name yet?\nHoward: We have named her Halley.\nPenny: \xe2\x80\x93 Oh.\nLeonard: Oh, like Halley\xe2\x80\x99s comet.\nHoward: Exactly. Also like the comet, Bernadette said she\xe2\x80\x99s not gonna have sex with me for another 75 years.\nAmy: That\xe2\x80\x99s not a real thing, he\xe2\x80\x99s just joking.\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna get back. Thank you for staying up, I can\xe2\x80\x99t wait for Halley to meet her new aunts and uncles and godfather.\nRaj: Really?\nHoward: Of course.\nRaj: You hear that, Stuart? I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a dog and a godchild, you have nothing.\nScene: The hospital nursery.\nPenny: Oh, look at all the babies.\nSheldon: Some will be successful, some may be homeless. It\xe2\x80\x99s fun to think about.\nLeonard; I wonder which one\xe2\x80\x99s Halley.\nAmy: Kind of hard to see the names.\nPenny: Mm, that one kind of looks like Bernadette.\nAmy: They all look the same to me.\nRaj: Guys, she\xe2\x80\x99s my goddaughter, I think I\xe2\x80\x99ll know when I see her. That one.\nScene: The stairwell.\nAmy: Well, that was quite a day.\nSheldon: It was. Bernadette had her baby, I made it to Wizarding World, and now it is time to complete your birthday celebration. Hankius pankius.\nAmy: I was afraid you\xe2\x80\x99d be too tired.\nSheldon: Amy, I just saw a magic train and reported somebody for cutting the line. If that\xe2\x80\x99s not foreplay, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what is.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
