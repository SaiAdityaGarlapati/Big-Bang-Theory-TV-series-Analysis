b'Scene: The apartment\nPenny: Oh, hey, if you guys are free this weekend, I won a night of wine tasting from work.\nLeonard: That sounds fun.\nPenny: Mm-hmm.\nLeonard: How come scientists don\xe2\x80\x99t win free stuff like salespeople do?\nHoward: \xe2\x80\x98Cause we\xe2\x80\x99re not in it for the stuff. We\xe2\x80\x99re in it for the groupies.\nSheldon: Personally, I find the notion of external rewards demeaning. I pursue science for the intrinsic joy of discovery.\nAmy: But you always say that you want to win a Nobel Prize.\nSheldon: I also say don\xe2\x80\x99t contradict me in front of my friends, but that you don\xe2\x80\x99t remember.\nPenny: All right, well, let me know if you guys want to go.\nRaj: I would love to. I do enjoy the complexity of an aged Pinot noir.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that would pair nicely with your fried nuggets of chicken.\nAmy: Well, it sounds like a nice night. We should go.\nSheldon: Wine again? Yeah, no, thank you. I like my grapes the old-fashioned way, in a juice box.\nAmy: Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m going. You couldn\xe2\x80\x99t stop me from getting a massage at the mall, and you\xe2\x80\x99re not stopping me now.\nSheldon: I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have to see my girlfriend get groped in public by another man.\nAmy: And I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have to see my boyfriend riding on a train for children around the mall.\nPenny: The little choo-choo for toddlers?\nAmy: And now you know why I needed the massage.\nHoward: Well, we\xe2\x80\x99re out. Bernie can\xe2\x80\x99t drink \xe2\x80\x99cause she\xe2\x80\x99s pregnant. And she\xe2\x80\x99s pregnant because we had sex. And we had sex because, well, come on.\nBernadette: It\xe2\x80\x99s okay, you should go.\nHoward: You sure?\nBernadette: Of course.\nPenny: Yeah, give her a break from, well, come on.\nSheldon: Well, Bernadette, looks like Saturday night, it\xe2\x80\x99s you and me.\nBernadette: Me? How? Why?\nSheldon: Well, it makes perfect sense. Because you\xe2\x80\x99re an expectant mother, you can\xe2\x80\x99t drink alcohol. I don\xe2\x80\x99t like to. You can\xe2\x80\x99t have sushi. I don\xe2\x80\x99t like to. You can\xe2\x80\x99t go in hot tubs. I consider them vats of sweaty people soup.\nBernadette: Gee, Sheldon, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\nSheldon: Oh, come on. Roller coasters, caffeine, runny eggs, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been avoiding these things all my life. And now, because you\xe2\x80\x99re pregnant, you have to.\nLeonard: The difference is she\xe2\x80\x99s bringing life into the world, and you suck it out.\nBernadette: I guess we could give it a try.\nSheldon: Well, little lady, you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard of party hearty, get ready to party hardly.\nHoward: I bet you\xe2\x80\x99d like a drink right now.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: Howard\xe2\x80\x99s workshop\nRaj: Hey, you think it\xe2\x80\x99d be okay if I brought Claire to the wine tasting?\nLeonard: Sure. I\xe2\x80\x99d like to meet her.\nRaj: Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s great. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been wanting her to meet you guys, too, so this seems like the perfect opportunity.\nSheldon: Oh, but I won\xe2\x80\x99t be there.\nRaj: Funny how that worked out.\nLeonard: Does this mean Emily\xe2\x80\x99s not in the picture anymore?\nRaj: No, I\xe2\x80\x99m still dating her.\nLeonard: Okay, help me out. How are you doing this? Do they know about each other?\nRaj: They know that we\xe2\x80\x99re not exclusive, and we just don\xe2\x80\x99t ask too many questions.\nSheldon: You know, it\xe2\x80\x99s like how I play Warlords of Ka\xe2\x80\x99a with you and Elder Sign with Frank and Alicia.\nLeonard: Who\xe2\x80\x99s Frank and Alicia?\nSheldon: You, you and I spend a lot of time together. Can there be a little mystery between us?\nHoward: Okay. Everything\xe2\x80\x99s hooked up. We\xe2\x80\x99re ready.\nSheldon: I am going to record this for posterity.\nLeonard: All right, here goes nothing.\nSheldon: Here goes nothing? This is the initial test of our prototype. Can we give it a little more gravitas?\nLeonard: Fine. Preliminary trial of the infinite persistence gyroscopic navigational system, phase one commencing.\nSheldon: Eh, maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s your voice. I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna see if I can get James Earl Jones to do it in post.\nRaj: It\xe2\x80\x99s, it\xe2\x80\x99s beautiful.\nHoward: Actually, it\xe2\x80\x99s making me dizzy.\nLeonard: Good, it\xe2\x80\x99s not just me.\nScene: Raj\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nClaire (on phone): Hello.\nRaj: Hey, Claire.\nClaire: Hey, what\xe2\x80\x99s up?\nRaj: Hi, yeah. Um, I was wondering, if you\xe2\x80\x99re free Saturday night, all my friends are going to a wine tasting.\nClaire: Sure, I guess. If you don\xe2\x80\x99t think meeting your friends is too big a step.\nRaj: Why would it be too big a step?\nClaire: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I just don\xe2\x80\x99t want things to get weird.\nRaj: Nothing to worry about. People meet people all the time, and it isn\xe2\x80\x99t weird. I met Bon Jovi once, which you\xe2\x80\x99d think might be weird. Turns out, total sweetheart.\nClaire: Okay, but you and I have been keeping things casual. Uh, will you introduce me as your friend or as your girlfriend? What if I like them and they don\xe2\x80\x99t like me? What if they like me and I don\xe2\x80\x99t like them?\nRaj: Boy, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t this hard with Bon Jovi. I said you rock, he said, thanks, man, and that was that.\nScene: The apartment.\nPenny: Hey, you ready to go?\nLeonard: Hang on.\nPenny: What are you doing?\nLeonard: Oh, I found a scratch-and-sniff book about wine tasting. It teaches the different flavour notes to look for.\nPenny: You actually smell the wine?\nLeonard: I mostly just smell my nasal spray.\nPenny: Are your sinuses acting up?\nLeonard: Since my preschool got a bunny.\nPenny: Hey, are you still hanging out with Bernadette tonight?\nSheldon: Yes. And we\xe2\x80\x99re going to prove that we don\xe2\x80\x99t need alcohol to enjoy ourselves.\nPenny: Oh, good for you.\nSheldon: Or caffeine, tobacco, sushi, soft cheese, processed meats and jacuzzis, which can all be harmful to an unborn baby.\nPenny: No honey baked ham in a hot tub, got it.\nSheldon: Oh, no bubble baths either. They can increase the risk of a urinary tract infection.\nLeonard: Okay, have fun.\nSheldon: Oh, and no swordfish, king mackerel, shark or tilefish, which are all high in mercury.\nLeonard: We\xe2\x80\x99re leaving now!\nSheldon: Oh, and no contact with guinea pigs or hamsters or their droppings, uh, no-no cat litter boxes, no paint fumes.\nPenny: Okay, we\xe2\x80\x99re leaving, love you, bye.\nSheldon: Boy, do I love restrictions.\nScene: The wine tasting.\nHoward: Hey. Where is everybody?\nAmy: Oh, we\xe2\x80\x99re the first ones here.\nHoward: Oh. Cool.\nAmy: Yeah. Cool.\nHoward: You know, I don\xe2\x80\x99t remember the last time it was just you and me hanging out.\nAmy: Oh, I do. It was three years ago.\nHoward: Oh, yeah, and we said we should do it more often. And, and, and, and, and here we are.\nAmy: So, Sheldon and Bernadette are hanging out.\nHoward: I know. What are they gonna talk about?\nAmy: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I really don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\nLeonard: Hey.\nHoward: Oh, good.\nAmy: Oh, thank God.\nPenny: You guys been here long?\nHoward: No, two minutes.\nAmy: But yes.\nHoward: Where\xe2\x80\x99s Claire?\nRaj: Oh, she\xe2\x80\x99s meeting us here. Hey, guys, do me a favour and don\xe2\x80\x99t ask too many questions about the relationship. We\xe2\x80\x99re just keeping it casual.\nLeonard: Oh, so I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t ask her how she feels about being a member of your harem?\nRaj: Yeah, I know you\xe2\x80\x99re teasing, but watch out for karma.\nAmy: Hey, Penny, isn\xe2\x80\x99t that your old boyfriend Zack?\nPenny: Oh, yeah.\nAmy: Are you gonna say hi to him?\nPenny: Uh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\nRaj: Hey, while you decide, who was better in bed, big hot Zack or wheezy little Leonard? Neener neener.\nScene: The apartment.\nBernadette: I brought sparkling cider.\nSheldon: Oh, the bubbles tickle my nose. I\xe2\x80\x99ll just open this now so it can get nice and flat before we drink it.\nBernadette: So what do you want to do tonight?\nSheldon: Oh, I have quite the evening planned. Our foetus-friendly festival of fun begins with an in-depth look at the world of model trains, and then we\xe2\x80\x99ll kick things up a notch and explore all the different ways that you can make toast.\nBernadette: There\xe2\x80\x99s more than one?\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99ve heard of French toast?\nBernadette: Yeah.\nSheldon: Cinnamon toast?\nBernadette: Yeah.\nSheldon: Melba toast?\nBernadette: Yeah.\nSheldon: You get where I\xe2\x80\x99m going here?\nBernadette: Yeah.\nScene: The wine tasting.\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99m getting an earthy note.\nPenny: Ah, there\xe2\x80\x99s definitely some oak.\nRaj: Also, uh, cherries?\nLeonard: I smell nothing.\nHoward: Really? Nothing?\nLeonard: Just a whole lot of Afrin.\nZack: Penny?\nPenny: Oh. Zack, hi. You guys remember Zack.\nHoward: Yeah, hey, buddy.\nAmy: Hello.\nRaj: Hey.\nZack: Hey, did you two get married?\nPenny: We did.\nLeonard: Yeah, mm-hmm.\nZack: To each other?\nPenny: Yes.\nZack: Cool. \xe2\x80\x98Cause other than when you broke up with him and dated me, then broke up with me, and then dated me one more time before going back to him, I was always rooting for you two.\nLeonard: Thanks.\nZack: So how\xe2\x80\x99s the science world? What are you guys up to?\nHoward: We\xe2\x80\x99ve actually been working on a prototype for a navigation system we invented.\nLeonard: But we won\xe2\x80\x99t bore you with the details.\nZack: Are you kidding? I love science. Einstein, Stephen Hawking, Mike deGrasse Tyson.\nAmy: Mike deGrasse Tyson?\nHoward: Yeah, you know, the boxer who grew a moustache and became a scientist.\nZack: So what\xe2\x80\x99s your invention?\nHoward: Well, we\xe2\x80\x99re using quantum vortices to replace gyroscopes in guidance systems.\nLeonard: What\xe2\x80\x99s neat is that they can maintain angular momentum indefinitely.\nZack: Angular momentum. I was wondering about that.\nHoward: You could put it in a satellite or a rocket, and it\xe2\x80\x99ll run forever.\nZack: Cool. Could it be used for missiles and war stuff?\nHoward: Yeah, but we didn\xe2\x80\x99t create it for weapons.\nLeonard: And I doubt the military would be interested in our little guidance system.\nZack: Is it better than the one they use now?\nHoward: A lot.\nLeonard: Way better.\nZack: Huh. You sure you guys are smart?\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: H-O gauge trains are 1/87th scale. N gauge are 1/160th scale. And that brings us to Z gauge, at a, you could easily swallow it, don\xe2\x80\x99t ask how I know, 1 to 220.\nBernadette: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, I have to ask.\nSheldon: When I was five, I ingested a Z gauge locomotive. I spent the next three days saying, I think I can pass it, I think I can pass it, I think I can pass it.\nBernadette: What is it about trains that you like so much?\nSheldon: What an interesting question. When I was a child, life was confusing and chaotic for me, and trains represented order. I could line them up, categorize them, control them. I guess you could say that they gave me a sense of calm in a world that didn\xe2\x80\x99t.\nBernadette: That\xe2\x80\x99s lovely, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Well, other than when they\xe2\x80\x99re chugging through your bowels, these things are magic.\nScene: The wine tasting.\nLeonard: I have to admit, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been worried about the military applications since we started talking about this.\nHoward: Me, too.\nLeonard: Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you say something?\nHoward: Same reason I don\xe2\x80\x99t talk about ass cancer. It\xe2\x80\x99s not a pleasant topic.\nRaj: You can\xe2\x80\x99t let this stop you. Almost any scientific advancement can be used for destructive purposes.\nAmy: It\xe2\x80\x99s true. Even Einstein\xe2\x80\x99s theory of relativity was later applied to the development of nuclear weapons.\nPenny: E equals MC squared. Yeah. E is for energy, M for mass, and C for the speed of light.\nAmy: How do you know that?\nPenny: Oh, Leonard mumbles it when he wants sex to last longer.\nClaire: Hey, Raj.\nRaj: Hey, Claire. Good, you\xe2\x80\x99re here. Guys, this is my friend Claire. We\xe2\x80\x99re casually dating, and there\xe2\x80\x99s no need for any further questions about it.\nLeonard: Would you like a glass of wine?\nRaj: I said no questions.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: And last but not least, this is one that I like to call Star Wars Toast because it has a light side and a dark side. All righty, it\xe2\x80\x99s time for Dungeons & Dragons.\nBernadette: Dungeons & Dragons? That sounds about right.\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re gonna enjoy this. I designed it especially for you.\nBernadette: Okay, but just for a little bit.\nSheldon: Oh, I have a feeling that once you start, you\xe2\x80\x99re not gonna want to or be allowed to stop.\nBernadette: All right.\nSheldon: Ready?\nBernadette: You bet.\nSheldon: Your name is Bernatrix. You are a warrior queen. You\xe2\x80\x99re strong, beautiful and tall.\nBernadette: Oh. I like the idea of being tall.\nSheldon: I think you\xe2\x80\x99re gonna like a lot of things I have in store. For example, in this world, only the men get pregnant, so your husband is home trying not to pee when he laughs.\nBernadette: This is getting fun. What\xe2\x80\x99s next?\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re parched and weary from battle. You stand in front of a tavern that serves the coldest, most delicious ale in all the realm.\nBernadette: Oh, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t had a drink in months.\nSheldon: What do you do?\nBernadette: I storm in, slam my sword down, and say, barkeep, bring me the strongest ale you have and serve it in the skull of a goblin.\nSheldon: He wants to see I.D.\nScene: The wine tasting.\nAmy: So, Claire, we\xe2\x80\x99ve heard so many wonderful things about you.\nClaire: Really? Like what?\nAmy: Uh, mostly Penny\xe2\x80\x99s heard them.\nZack: Boy, you get some dirty looks over there when you ask for ice.\nRaj: Zack, this is my friend Claire.\nZack: You\xe2\x80\x99re hot. You seeing anybody?\nRaj: Uh, she\xe2\x80\x99s seeing me.\nZack: Why\xe2\x80\x99d you say she\xe2\x80\x99s your friend?\nRaj: We\xe2\x80\x99re just keeping it casual.\nZack: Why is he being casual with you? You seem great.\nClaire: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Ask him.\nZack: Why are you being casual with her? She seems great.\nScene: The toilets.\nLeonard: Maybe we should take a step back.\nHoward: Take a step back? I\xe2\x80\x99m not a young man any more.\nLeonard: No, I mean re-evaluate what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing with the guidance system.\nHoward: But I got a baby on the way. I got to make some money.\nLeonard: What good is money gonna do if we inadvertently bring about Armageddon?\nHoward: Okay, let me stop you right there. We absolutely know our invention will not be used to destroy the world.\nLeonard: How?\nHoward: Because no one from the future has come back to kill us.\nLeonard: Very funny.\nHoward: You got something better?\nLeonard: Well, not really.\nHoward: Okay, then. Geez, how much wine did you drink?\nLeonard: Not a lot. I just couldn\xe2\x80\x99t start until you walked away.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: The Hell Prawn lunges out of the hot spring. You block it with your shield. Do you attack?\nBernadette: Does it have eyes?\nSheldon: Three giant red ones and they never blink. It\xe2\x80\x99s unsettling.\nBernadette: I stab it in the middle eye.\nSheldon: Good choice. Critical hit. Your sword goes through its eye into its tiny brain. With its final dying gasp, it says, you have reduced me to a pile of sushi. Enjoy me with this packet of soy sauce. It\xe2\x80\x99s low sodium. Aaaah.\nBernadette: Okay, I guess I should eat the Hell Prawn.\nSheldon: Using your sword, you prepare a beautiful sushi dinner. You slip into the hot spring and enjoy the warm water on your aching joints. As you happily close your eyes, you recall the incredible evening you\xe2\x80\x99ve had and notice that your feet and ankles are smaller than they\xe2\x80\x99ve ever been. The end.\nBernadette: Wow, this night turned out to be so much more fun than I thought.\nSheldon: Oh, the fun doesn\xe2\x80\x99t stop. You\xe2\x80\x99re still going home with a goodie bag full of toast.\nBernadette: Thank you for this. You know, ever since people found out I\xe2\x80\x99m having a baby, I feel like I became Pregnant Bernadette. It was nice to take a little break tonight.\nSheldon: I can understand that. From the moment people realized I was a genius, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been Sheldon the Genius. Although I\xe2\x80\x99ve never really wanted a break from that, so I suppose I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand. Which is ironic \xe2\x80\x99cause, you know, genius.\nBernadette: Well, thanks again.\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re welcome. And any time you need a break from being Bernadette the Pregnant, Bernatrix the Warrior Queen is here waiting.\nBernadette: I might just take you up on that.\nSheldon: Well, mind you now, that offer\xe2\x80\x99s only good until the third trimester. I can\xe2\x80\x99t risk getting amniotic fluid on my spot.\nScene: The wine tasting.\nRaj: Hey, dude, you\xe2\x80\x99re killing me with Claire.\nZack: What are you talking about?\nRaj: I mean, come on, look at you. You\xe2\x80\x99re classically handsome, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got a swimmer\xe2\x80\x99s body. Next to you, I look like me.\nZack: Oh, man, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to do that. But I do appreciate you recognizing my swimmer\xe2\x80\x99s body. Which, incidentally, I got from playing Marco Polo at the YMCA.\nRaj: Yeah, okay, just do me a favour and stop talking about how great Claire is.\nZack: Anything for you, my little foreign friend.\nClaire: So, I got to ask, does Raj bring around other girls?\nPenny: Uh, you know, I\xe2\x80\x99m not really around that much. Amy knows much more than I do.\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you have anything to worry about. Raj is a terrific guy, loyal to a fault.\nHoward: Yeah. He still has an AOL address.\nZack: I see what you\xe2\x80\x99re saying. She\xe2\x80\x99s not so great.\nRaj: Don\xe2\x80\x99t listen to him. He says crazy things all the time. Uh, watch. Marco.\nZack: Polo.\nRaj: So, uh, what are you guys talking about?\nClaire: Your friends were just telling me about all the other girls you\xe2\x80\x99re dating.\nRaj: Why would you do that? I specifically asked you not to do that.\nPenny: We didn\xe2\x80\x99t.\nAmy: You just did.\nZack: Wow. Maybe none of you guys are smart.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: Morning.\nSheldon: Morning.\nLeonard: Ugh. Too much wine.\nSheldon: Oh, I overdid it myself last night. Hair of the dog.\nLeonard: Hey, did you ever think about the military applications for the guidance system?\nSheldon: Of course.\nLeonard: Does it bother you?\nSheldon: No, it did at first, but then I talked it through with Frank and Alicia, and they really helped put things into perspective.\nLeonard: Who are these people?\nSheldon: Leonard, friends are like toilet paper. It\xe2\x80\x99s good to have extras under the sink.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
