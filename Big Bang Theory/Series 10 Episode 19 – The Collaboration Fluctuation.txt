b'Scene: The apartment.\nRaj: You know, downward-facing dog comes from the Sanskrit phrase adho mukha shvanasana.\nPenny: Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s beautiful. What does it mean?\nRaj: Downward-facing dog.\nPenny: Yeah, I guess they don\xe2\x80\x99t have Sanskrit for butts up and heads down.\nRaj: Hey, we wrote the Kama Sutra. If it involves butts, there\xe2\x80\x99s a word for it.\nLeonard: I thought we were getting breakfast before work.\nPenny: Oh, right, sorry.\nRaj: It\xe2\x80\x99s my fault. I asked Penny to do yoga with me.\nPenny: If you want, I can get ready in five minutes.\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s cute that you think that. Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry about it.\nRaj: Hey, can I ask you a favour? Would you mind taking Cinnamon for a walk?\nLeonard: Sure. You\xe2\x80\x99re living here for free, I guess I owe you.\nRaj: Bye, Cinnamon. Be a good girl.\nPenny: Yeah, bye, sweetie.\nLeonard: Bye.\nPenny: Yeah, yeah, bye, Leonard.\nRaj: Okay, and tree pose.\nLeonard: Well, she\xe2\x80\x99s done.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: Amy\xe2\x80\x99s car.\nSheldon: Things have been going really well with the infinite resistance gyroscope.\nAmy: That\xe2\x80\x99s great. How so?\nSheldon: Oh, the project is classified. I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell you. Oh, I suppose I could redact the classified parts. All right, um, I came up with an elegant solution to the (honks horn) I used the (honks horn) And then I (honks horn) And that did it. (Car passes honking horn) Wow, I wonder what they\xe2\x80\x99re redacting.\nAmy: Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you ask me what I\xe2\x80\x99m working on?\nSheldon: Oh, very well. What have you been working on? And feel free to honk during the boring parts.\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99m doing some experiments to show that the signal to move a muscle occurs before you know you even decided to move it.\nSheldon: So you\xe2\x80\x99re attempting to pinpoint where consciousness resides in the brain.\nAmy: Yes, I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to figure out to the nanometer and the attosecond, precisely where and when an event of awareness takes place.\nSheldon: Well, what do you know? Here I was, waiting to be bored with biology, and instead you tickle my intellectual fancy. Which, unlike my body, is an okay place to tickle.\nAmy: You know, when I was six, I wanted to marry the gorilla from Good Night, Gorilla. Maybe I was onto something.\nScene: The cafeteria.\nSheldon: Gentlemen, the most interesting thing just happened with this spoon.\nHoward: Unless it was singing Be Our Guest, I doubt it.\nSheldon: Yeah, I picked it up without thinking about it. Which raises a neuroscientific question, when did I decide to pick it up?\nRaj: The bigger question is, what are you gonna eat with that spoon? You didn\xe2\x80\x99t get any food.\nLeonard: He does raise an interesting point.\nSheldon: Amy is studying the time lag between intent and awareness, and I realized that applies to the measurement problem in quantum mechanics. Now, I recognize there will be a time lag between me saying that and you Googling what it means, so I\xe2\x80\x99ll wait.\nLeonard: I understand it, Sheldon.\nRaj: Yeah, me, too.\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, I spaced. Are we still talking about the spoon?\nRaj: It\xe2\x80\x99s nice to see you taking an interest in Amy\xe2\x80\x99s work.\nSheldon: Well, don\xe2\x80\x99t get me wrong. Neurobiology\xe2\x80\x99s nothing more than the science of gray squishy stuff. But, you know, when it connects to physics, gas up the Ford, Martha, we\xe2\x80\x99re going for a drive.\nScene: The apartment.\nRaj: So did you confront Jennifer?\nPenny: No, I was going to, but she called in sick. And guess who else called in sick.\nRaj: Paul.\nPenny: Paul.\nLeonard: Who\xe2\x80\x99s Paul?\nPenny: Oh, you met him at the office Christmas party. He\xe2\x80\x99s married to Nancy.\nLeonard: Oh, sure. Wait, Nancy?\nPenny: I bet Jennifer gets a promotion out of this, which is so unfair because I work twice as hard as she does.\nRaj: Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry, Jerry won\xe2\x80\x99t be fooled by that type of behaviour.\nLeonard: Jerry?\nRaj: It didn\xe2\x80\x99t work for Randy, it didn\xe2\x80\x99t work for Tina, it sure as hell isn\xe2\x80\x99t gonna work for Jennifer.\nPenny: Well, I hope not. I just hate when people play those kinds of games.\nLeonard: Tina?\nRaj: With your sales record, you have nothing to worry about.\nPenny: Mm.\nLeonard: I went to your office Christmas party?\nScene: Sheldon and Amy\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nAmy: You know, I like harp lessons, but I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking of switching to elevator repair lessons. What are you working on?\nSheldon: I was thinking about your experiment on the neuroscience of decision making, and I realized, if we connect it to the measurement problem in quantum mechanics, we have a chance to disprove the role of consciousness in the Copenhagen Interpretation.\nAmy: Wait, are you saying if we combine my experiment with your calculations, we can determine the precise moment in time when the wave function collapses?\nSheldon: It could be the most inspired combination since I mixed red Icee into my blue Icee. It was like drinking two sevenths of the rainbow.\nAmy: Sheldon, this is really interesting.\nSheldon: Yeah, and this one won\xe2\x80\x99t stain my teeth purple.\nAmy: You know, we\xe2\x80\x99ve never collaborated professionally before. Are you worried it might affect our relationship?\nSheldon: That is a valid point. Perhaps we should establish some ground rules.\nAmy: Well, that would make me feel better.\nSheldon: All right, let\xe2\x80\x99s start right now. Uh, rule number one, no using sexuality to get your way.\nAmy: That\xe2\x80\x99s a ridiculous rule.\nSheldon: Is it?\nScene: The apartment.\nPenny: Okay, how is that?\nRaj: I can actually feel the toxins being pulled out of my skin.\nPenny: Well, this is a moisturizing mask.\nRaj: Oh, well, then I can actually feel the moisture going into my skin.\nPenny: Hey, I hope you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind, I used a little of your eye cream last night.\nRaj: I thought someone looked brighter and tighter.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99d still like to know who Jerry is.\nPenny: Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry about it. Hey, after this, how about we all go out and do something together?\nLeonard: That would be great. Thank you.\nRaj: You want to go shopping?\nPenny: Ooh, yes. Fun.\nLeonard: Or we could do something we\xe2\x80\x99ll all enjoy, like play a board game.\nMontage of shopping scenes.\nScene: Sheldon and Amy\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nSheldon: I believe I\xe2\x80\x99ve made some progress on our ground rules.\nAmy: Oh, good. What are they?\nSheldon: Okay, uh, number one, in matters of physics, I have the final say. In matters of neuroscience, you have the final say. Unless I disagree. Oh, here. Number two, when we publish,\nmy name goes first. Oh, subsequently, if we win any awards, I speak first. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be talking when the orchestra plays us off.\nAmy: Can I see that?\nSheldon: Oh, of course. I\xe2\x80\x99ll get that back. Like all my underwear, that notebook says Property of Sheldon Cooper.\nAmy: Sheldon, if we\xe2\x80\x99re gonna have ground rules, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you the first ground rule. I make the ground rules.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99d write that down, but I can\xe2\x80\x99t now, can I?\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s minivan.\nLeonard: I mean, they didn\xe2\x80\x99t say anything, but I just kind of felt like I was being a weird third wheel.\nHoward: Huh, so you can tell what that feels like. Interesting.\nLeonard: Anyway, I figured I can hang out with my friends and have fun, too.\nBernadette: Well, if your idea of fun is riding in a minivan to Target for diapers, things are about to get nuts.\nLeonard: Oh, it\xe2\x80\x99s just nice to be with people who are happy to have me around. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that right, Halley?\nHalley: (cries)\nHoward: Well, at least someone had the courage to say it.\nScene: Sheldon and Amy\xe2\x80\x99s door.\nSheldon: Thank you, you are a good citizen. Told you. Go ahead, throw my underwear out the window. Same thing\xe2\x80\x99s gonna happen.\nAmy: Terrific. Do you want to hear our new set of ground rules?\nSheldon: Fire away.\nAmy: Number one, we\xe2\x80\x99re on the same team, we\xe2\x80\x99re not in competition.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s smart, because Sheldon 1, Amy 0.\nAmy: Number two, disagreements can happen politely. There\xe2\x80\x99s no need to call an idea stupid.\nSheldon: Aw, someone drew a penis in it.\nAmy: Are you listening?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, go ahead.\nAmy: Number three, to avoid getting frustrated, we take built-in breaks and reward our successes with a small treat.\nSheldon: Ooh, that sounds fun. Now, we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about real treats, right? Not Bible verses like my mother used to give me.\nAmy: Whatever you want. So, shall we get to work?\nSheldon: Biology and physics coming together, this is like the peanut butter cup of the mind. Oh, I know what I want my treat to be.\nMontage of Sheldon and Amy working together.\nAmy: Wow. Look at that.\nSheldon: Yes, this is remarkable.\nAmy: So we\xe2\x80\x99re agreed, it\xe2\x80\x99s complete garbage.\nSheldon: By the way, your name can go first.\nScene: Inside a store.\nLeonard: I mean, I\xe2\x80\x99m glad they\xe2\x80\x99re getting along, but it\xe2\x80\x99s starting to make me uncomfortable.\nBernadette: Well, are you worried he\xe2\x80\x99s like another man in her life?\nLeonard: A little, until I saw them in matching tops.\nHoward: Nice. 174 diapers. That ought to get us to Wednesday.\nBernadette: Well, have you talked to them about it?\nLeonard: Well, what am I supposed to say, stop having fun without me?\nHoward: This one says that every time I go out. See? I listen to you.\nBernadette: Look, Raj just gets along with women.\nLeonard: I know, but he was my friend first. It\xe2\x80\x99s like she\xe2\x80\x99s stealing him and they\xe2\x80\x99re just having the best time doing all their dumb girly stuff together.\nHoward: You sure you don\xe2\x80\x99t fit in? You sound like a catty bitch to me.\nScene: Sheldon and Amy\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nAmy: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know where we went wrong.\nSheldon: Yeah, the math is so inelegant. I\xe2\x80\x99m not even sure it makes sense.\nAmy: Well, don\xe2\x80\x99t give up. Maybe we can fix it.\nSheldon: Can you stop breathing so loud? I can hear your nose whistling.\nAmy: I can hear your face talking, so we\xe2\x80\x99re even.\nSheldon: All right, either blow your nose or teach it to play Camptown Races.\nAmy: Fine. Fine. You want me to blow my nose? Here, I\xe2\x80\x99ll blow it. Better?\nSheldon: No, I can still hear it. Oh, wait, that\xe2\x80\x99s me. Never mind, it\xe2\x80\x99s fine.\nAmy: You know, you\xe2\x80\x99re exhausting. I knew working together was a bad idea.\nSheldon: Hold on. I see what\xe2\x80\x99s wrong here. We did the propagation only to the occipital lobe, not to the prefrontal cortex.\nAmy: That would mean that this delayed parameter should be increased 250 milliseconds.\nSheldon: Oh, that is much better. Yeah, boy, if good ideas came out of your brain the way mucus comes out of your nose, we\xe2\x80\x99d be in good shape.\nScene: The apartment.\nRaj: Now, take a sip, swirl it around your mouth, and try to notice the flavours, the tannins, the textures. Well?\nPenny: I probably should have spit out my gum first.\nRaj: Yeah. You know, the last couple of weeks have been pretty rough, but, uh, staying here with you guys has really helped take my mind off of it.\nPenny: Mm. Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ve loved having you around. Right, sweetie? Leonard?\nRaj: When did he leave?\nPenny: Yeah, that\xe2\x80\x99s rude.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s minivan.\nLeonard: You know, it\xe2\x80\x99s nice to spend time with people who don\xe2\x80\x99t talk about work like it\xe2\x80\x99s some kind of soap opera.\nBernadette: Jennifer still trying to sleep her way to the top?\nLeonard: Yeah.\nHoward: You should be happy someone wants to do the stuff with Penny you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to.\nBernadette: Yeah, I wish I had that with Howard.\nHoward: Wait. What? What do I make you do?\nBernadette: Let\xe2\x80\x99s see, the magic store, the Doctor Who convention, the National Belt Buckle Collector\xe2\x80\x99s meet and greet.\nHoward: It said right there on the invitation, buckle up for fun. It\xe2\x80\x99s not my fault you didn\xe2\x80\x99t listen.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m sure I\xe2\x80\x99m overreacting.\nBernadette: You\xe2\x80\x99re entitled to feel how you feel. If you don\xe2\x80\x99t like it, you should just talk to her.\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to sound like a jealous baby.\nBernadette: Oh, then maybe you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t talk to her.\nScene: Sheldon and Amy\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nAmy: I had a feeling you were using the wrong computational model, but I didn\xe2\x80\x99t say anything \xe2\x80\x99cause you\xe2\x80\x99re so sensitive.\nSheldon: Just because I am easily bothered by light, heat, sound, smell and the way birds look at me does not mean I\xe2\x80\x99m sensitive.\nAmy: Hey, I wonder what kind of success we\xe2\x80\x99d have if we defined measurement as the first moment that an action potential is seen by the visual cortex.\nSheldon: That is a daring and insightful solution.\nAmy: We\xe2\x80\x99re finally making progress. I wish we could do it without fighting.\nSheldon: What if the fighting is the reason we\xe2\x80\x99re making progress?\nAmy: I suppose it\xe2\x80\x99s conceivable that the hormones associated with our fight-or-flight response could be sharpening our cognitive processes.\nSheldon: Well, if that\xe2\x80\x99s the case, then your grandparents mumble and have bad posture.\nAmy: How dare you speak that way about my Grammy and hey, wait a second. Wait. Delta T could equal alpha sub-zero.\nSheldon: It seems we have a choice to make. Abandon all ground rules in the name of science, or give up collaborating for the sake of our relationship.\nAmy: There\xe2\x80\x99s only one clear choice.\nSheldon: Science it is.\nAmy: No, you bonehead.\nSheldon: Name calling, that is perfect. Now, when I get to this equation here, really let me have it. You know? If it helps, I\xe2\x80\x99m not the sharpest dresser.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: Anyway, I know it\xe2\x80\x99s silly, but since Raj moved in, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been feeling a little left out.\nPenny: Well, sweetie, that\xe2\x80\x99s crazy.\nRaj: No, no, Penny, don\xe2\x80\x99t dismiss his feelings.\nLeonard: Thank you. I just feel\xe2\x80\xa6\nRaj: Hang on, I\xe2\x80\x99m not saying that his feelings aren\xe2\x80\x99t crazy. I just don\xe2\x80\x99t want him to think that this isn\xe2\x80\x99t a safe place.\nLeonard: Well, to be truthful\xe2\x80\xa6\nPenny: Well, why wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t this be a safe place? I mean, he\xe2\x80\x99s surrounded by his wife and one of his best friends.\nRaj: I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to speak for Leonard.\nLeonard: Thank you. I\xe2\x80\xa6\nRaj: But when you\xe2\x80\x99re insecure, no amount of external validation can ever make you feel safe.\nPenny: Yeah, you\xe2\x80\x99re right. You know, you\xe2\x80\x99re really sensitive about this kind of stuff.\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99m a good listener.\nPenny: Yeah.\nLeonard: Hey, Olsen twins\xe2\x80\xa6\nPenny: What?\nLeonard: Well, I mean, I\xe2\x80\x99m sitting right here. You\xe2\x80\x99re talking about my feelings and somehow leaving me out of the conversation.\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. What did you want to say?\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, you pretty much covered it.\nScene: Sheldon and Amy\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nSheldon: Can you read them back?\nAmy: Revised ground rule number one, we are on the same team, but it is a competition.\nSheldon: Excellent. Excellent. And on a related point, you\xe2\x80\x99re going down, punk.\nAmy: Revised ground rule number two, there are definitely stupid questions, and those who ask them can be told so right to their stupid face.\nSheldon: I love that one.\nAmy: Thanks, babe. Number three, fair topics for insult include educational pedigree, scientific field, intellectual prowess, and mamas.\nSheldon: Yeah, that list is strong. Like your mother\xe2\x80\x99s urge to be promiscuous with sailors.\nAdvertisements\nREPORT THIS AD\nREPORT THIS AD'
