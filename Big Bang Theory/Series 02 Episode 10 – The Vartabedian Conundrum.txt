b'Scene: The apartment.\nSteph: I don\xe2\x80\x99t see anything at all, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Well, you\xe2\x80\x99re the doctor, but I am constantly hearing this annoying sound.\nLeonard: Me, too.\nSheldon: Is it a high-frequency whistle?\nLeonard: No, it\xe2\x80\x99s more of a relentless, narcissistic drone.\nSteph: Yup, there\xe2\x80\x99s no inflammation at all, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Then it must be a tumour.\nSteph: I Seriously doubt it.\nLeonard: Maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s a lingering bacterial infection from all those childhood toilet swirlies.\nSheldon: Is that possible? I used to get those all the time. Even in church.\nSteph: Well, you know, if it is from a swirly, there\xe2\x80\x99s something I can do. Okay, circle, circle, dot, dot, now you have a cootie shot! I\xe2\x80\x99m going to bed\nLeonard: Okay, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be right in.\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s not enough that she mocks me, but that isn\xe2\x80\x99t even the correct procedure for a cootie shot.\nLeonard: Do you understand that Stephanie\xe2\x80\x99s not here to treat your imaginary ailments?\nSheldon: How is it imaginary that I keep hearing an octave above Middle C? Is that imaginary? I don\xe2\x80\x99t think so.\nLeonard: Good night.\nSheldon: Leonard, there\xe2\x80\x99s one more thing. Under Article One, Section Three of our Roommate Agreement, I\xe2\x80\x99m calling an emergency meeting.\nLeonard: No, you\xe2\x80\x99re not.\nSheldon: Leonard moves the meeting not occur. Is there a second? None heard, the motion fails. I\xe2\x80\x99d like to begin the meeting by congratulating you on the progress in your relationship with Dr. Stephanie.\nLeonard: Thank you.\nSheldon: That being said, we have to discuss the implementation of the agreed upon \xe2\x80\x9ccohabitation\xe2\x80\x9d rider which has been activated now that the two of you are living together.\nLeonard: We\xe2\x80\x99re not living together.\nSheldon: I beg to disagree. \xe2\x80\x9cA girlfriend shall be deemed quote living with un-quote Leonard when she has stayed over for A, ten consecutive nights or B, more than nine nights in three week period or C: all the weekends of a given month plus three weeknights.\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99s absurd.\nSheldon: You initialed it. See? L.H., L.H., L.H.\nLeonard: Wait, I only initialed it because I never thought it would happen! I initialed another clause naming you my sidekick in case I get superpowers.\nSheldon: Hmm, yes, you did. Now, to review the following provisions are hereby activated. In the refrigerator, as opposed to us having two separate shelves and one communal shelf, the three of us now get individual shelves and the door becomes communal. Next, apartment vacuuming shall be increased from two to three times a week to accommodate the increased accumulation of dead skin cells. Third,the bathroom schedule. Now, I\xe2\x80\x99m given to understand women have different needs, so, we\xe2\x80\x99ll have to discuss that.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m going to bed.\nSheldon: At least take this with you. Look, and have Stephanie initial here, here, here, here and here. This states that she does not now nor does she intend to play a percussive or brass instrument. Sure it sounds like a tumor pressing on the auditory nerve.\nCredits sequence.\n  Scene: The kitchen.\nLeonard: No, absolutely not.\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s not a big deal. We have latex gloves.\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t care what the symptoms are, my girlfriend is not going to give you a prostate exam.\nSteph: Hi, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Good morning, Dr. Stephanie. I trust Leonard satisfied you sexually last night.\nLeonard: Oh come on! Sheldon, we don\xe2\x80\x99t ask questions like that.\nSheldon: I heard you ask it over and over. How is it inappropriate for me to ask it once?\nSteph: He did very nicely.\nSheldon: See? She\xe2\x80\x99s not offended. And now you finally have an answer.\nPenny (entering): Out of coffee. Need coffee.\nSteph: Uh, hello.\nPenny: Hi! Stephanie, right?\nSteph: Uh-huh. And, and, and you are?\nPenny: I\xe2\x80\x99m Penny, I live across the hall. I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard a lot about you.\nSteph: Really?\nPenny: Mm-hmm.\nSteph: I haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard a thing about you. Leonard? Why haven\xe2\x80\x99t I heard a thing about this woman who lives across the hall and comes into your apartment in the morning in her underwear?\nLeonard: She\xe2\x80\x99s heard about you because we\xe2\x80\x99re, you know, involved and you haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard about her because\xe2\x80\xa6 I never slept with her, I swear!\nSheldon: In Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s defence, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t for lack of trying.\nLeonard: Thank you, Sheldon.\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re welcome, Leonard.\nLeonard: Look, I\xe2\x80\x99m just saying, um, Penny is one of our many neighbours, you know, and in our building, neighbours come and go, it\xe2\x80\x99s very casual, no dress code. In fact, some mornings I\xe2\x80\x99ll just mosey down to the third floor in my pyjamas and have cereal with Mrs. Vartabedian.\nSheldon: Really? I have never once been invited to have cereal with Mrs. Vartabedian.\nLeonard: She doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like you. Um, well, uh, you have a gall bladder to remove and I have to get in the shower and Penny has clothes to put on, so\xe2\x80\xa6\nSteph: Well, it was very nice meeting you.\nPenny: Nice to finally meet you, too.\nSteph:  And I\xe2\x80\x99ll see you tonight?\nLeonard: Okay, bye-bye.\nSteph: Bye.\nSheldon: What could I possibly have done to offend Mrs. Vartabedian?\nPenny: So, that\xe2\x80\x99s Stephanie, huh?\nLeonard: Why do I feel like I\xe2\x80\x99m the one that just got the prostate exam?\nPenny: You know, she seems very nice.\nSheldon: Oh, she is. She\xe2\x80\x99s terrific, and she\xe2\x80\x99s proving to be a valuable roommate.\nPenny: Roommate? You guys are living together?\nSheldon: Like hippies.\nLeonard: We\xe2\x80\x99re not living together.\nSheldon: Do I have to pull out the paperwork again?\nLeonard: We\xe2\x80\x99re not living together.\nPenny: Are you sure?\nLeonard: How could I not be sure?\nPenny: Well, let\xe2\x80\x99s find out.\nLeonard: Don\xe2\x80\x99t you think if a woman was living with me I\xe2\x80\x99d be the first one to know about it?\nPenny: Oh, sweetie, you\xe2\x80\x99d be the last one to know about it. (Looking through his wardrobe) Hmm, cute dresses. I bet this looks great on you!\nLeonard: We\xe2\x80\x99re not living together.\nPenny: Okay, hmm, scented candles, fuzzy slippers, ooh, floral bed sheets?\nLeonard: We\xe2\x80\x99re not living together.\nPenny: Okay, moving on. Now, who are these guys at Disney World?\nLeonard: Uh, the big dog is Goofy, and the older couple with the mouse ears , I have no idea. We\xe2\x80\x99re not living together!\nPenny: You\xe2\x80\x99re going to go down swinging, huh? All right, well, we got your body lotion, your InStyle Magazine, your jewellery box.\nLeonard: We\xe2\x80\x99re not\xe2\x80\xa6 Where\xe2\x80\x99s my Bat Signal?\nPenny: You have a Bat Signal?\nLeonard: I did. It was right here. She must\xe2\x80\x99ve\xe2\x80\xa6 Oh, my God, we\xe2\x80\x99re living together.\nPenny: Really? What was your first clue?\nScene: The university cafeteria.\n  Howard: New pants?\nLeonard: Yeah, Stephanie got them for me.\nHoward: Nice. Cotton?\nLeonard: Actually, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s more of wool, fire ant blend.\nHoward: So, the girlfriend\xe2\x80\x99s buying clothes for you, huh? Sounds serious.\nLeonard: It is actually. In fact, I gave it a lot of thought and I decided it was time for us to live together.\nHoward: Uh, Leonard, huge mistake. There\xe2\x80\x99s a whole buffet of women out there and you\xe2\x80\x99re just standing in the corner eating the same devilled egg over and over again.\nLeonard: At least I have an egg. What do you have?\nHoward: A veritable smorgasbord of potential sexual partners. See the blonde over there? I can hit on her and you can\xe2\x80\x99t.\nLeonard: So, go hit on her.\nHoward: She\xe2\x80\x99s not my type.\nRaj: Too bad, \xe2\x80\x99cause she was checking you out before.\nHoward: She was?\nRaj: Of course not. Look at her.\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t care what you guys think, Stephanie and I are very happy living together. I will give either of you 20 dollars, right now to trade pants with me.\nScene: The hospital.\nSteph: Sheldon, what are you doing here?\nSheldon: Hang on. 130 over 80. A little high. We can attribute that to the stress of sneaking past the security desk.\nSteph: Where did you get the stethoscope and the blood pressure cuff?\nSheldon: My aunt Marion gave them to me for my 12th birthday. She thought if I failed at theoretical physics that I should have a trade to fall back on. And by the way, the blood pressure cuff is called a sphygmomanometer.\nSteph: Thank you.\nSheldon: Didn\xe2\x80\x99t they teach you that in medical school?\nSteph: I\xe2\x80\x99m kinda busy here, Sheldon.\nSheldon: I understand. All I need is for you to authorize these tests.\nSteph: A cardiac stress test, a full body MRI, an electromyogram, a CBC, baseline glucose, upper GI?\nSheldon: Oh, and an exploratory laparoscopy. Last time I had hiccups, it felt like my diaphragm was just going through the motions.\nSteph: Go home, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Can I at least have the upper GI? I already drank the barium!\nScene: The laundry room.\nPenny: Oh hey.\nLeonard: Oh, good. Do you have any fabric softener?\nPenny: Yeah, sure. What are you washing? A crocodile?\nLeonard: No, the pants that Stephanie got me.\nPenny: Oh, sweetie, you can\xe2\x80\x99t machine wash these. They\xe2\x80\x99ll be ruined.\nLeonard: Are you sure?\nPenny: Absolutely.\nLeonard: Oh, no. I wish you\xe2\x80\x99d told me that sooner.\nPenny: Are you guys having problems?\nLeonard: No, everything\xe2\x80\x99s fine.\nPenny: Really?\nLeonard: Yeah. It\xe2\x80\x99s wonderful. Okay, maybe this whole living together happened kind of suddenly, but it\xe2\x80\x99s fine, it\xe2\x80\x99s great.\nPenny: Okay, Leonard, honey, you know, if you\xe2\x80\x99re uncomfortable with the way things are going, you\xe2\x80\x99re allowed to say something.\nLeonard: Are you sure? That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t sound right.\nPenny: Believe me, your feelings are just as important as hers.\nLeonard: No that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t sound right either.\nPenny: Just tell her you need the relationship to move at a pace that you both are comfortable with.\nLeonard: Yeah, I could say something like that to her. I\xe2\x80\x99ll go do that. Thank you.\nPenny: Sure.\nLeonard: You have a really good grasp on this. Maybe you could talk to her?\nPenny: You\xe2\x80\x99re kidding, right?\nLeonard: No, but that\xe2\x80\x99s okay. I\xe2\x80\x99ll go talk to her. Want to come with?\nPenny: Go! Wow.\nScene: The apartment.\n  Steph: Oh, no.\nSheldon: Wha??\nSteph: You were right. Your larynx is terribly inflamed. I mean, I\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen anything like it.\nSheldon: I knew it! What do I do?\nSteph: You\xe2\x80\x99re going to need to stop talking immediately.\nSheldon: For how\xe2\x80\xa6\nSteph: Du-du-du-du! Immediately.\nLeonard: Hey.\nSteph: Oh, hi, honey.\nLeonard: Sheldon. (He waves) What\xe2\x80\x99s going on?\nSteph: I just performed a Sheldonectomy.\nLeonard: Careful, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t get it all, it\xe2\x80\x99ll only come back worse.\nSteph: Gotcha.\nLeonard: Listen, we need to talk.\nSteph: Oh-oh. Do we need to talk or do we \xe2\x80\x9cneed to talk\xe2\x80\x9d?\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what that means.\nSteph: Okay, why don\xe2\x80\x99t you just tell me what it is you have to tell me?\nLeonard: Okay, um, well, look, it\xe2\x80\x99s just that things between you and me have been going pretty quick.\nSteph: And?\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s just a little scary.\nSteph: Well, yeah, but scary good, right?\nLeonard: Sure, when is scary not good? But, okay, um, I have feelings, right?\nSteph: Uh-huh.\nLeonard: Okay, and it\xe2\x80\x99s perfectly okay to express those feelings, right?\nSteph: Of course honey why don\xe2\x80\x99t you tell me what it is you\xe2\x80\x99re feeling?\nLeonard: Okay, well, I ju\xe2\x80\xa6 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to remember that we move at a pace that is our speed and\xe2\x80\xa6 oh, shoot, I had it!\nSteph: Okay, how about this? How about I tell you what I\xe2\x80\x99m feeling?\nLeonard: What\xe2\x80\x99s that? Really? Right now?\nSteph: Why not?\nLeonard: I just ate, aren\xe2\x80\x99t you supposed to wait an hour?\nSteph: I think that\xe2\x80\x99s for swimming.\nLeonard: Oh, okay. I just hope I don\xe2\x80\x99t get cramps.\nSteph: Yeah.\nScene: The laundry room.\nLeonard: Hey.\nPenny: Hey. Oh, I put your clothes in the dryer.\nLeonard: Thank you.\nPenny: Your pants are ruined.\nLeonard: Good.\nPenny: So, how did the talk with Stephanie go?\nLeonard: Well, um, on one level, really, really well.\nPenny: So, you told her you wanted to slow things down?\nLeonard: Not specifically, but, uh, I did tell her that I had feelings.\nPenny: Good, good. And then what?\nLeonard: And then the, the subject got changed somehow.\nPenny: You had sex, didn\xe2\x80\x99t you?\nLeonard: Um, little bit. (She looks at her watch) What?\nPenny: Nothing. Okay, well, it sounds like things are going to work out.\nLeonard: Yeah, yeah it\xe2\x80\x99s all good. Everything\xe2\x80\x99s going to work out. One way or another.\nPenny: Come on, Leonard, you are entitled to try and make things go the way you want them to.\nLeonard: Really?\nPenny: Yes, you don\xe2\x80\x99t always have to go along with what the woman wants.\nLeonard: Huh.\nPenny: What?\nLeonard: Nothing, just rethinking my whole life. Okay, here\xe2\x80\x99s the thing, I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid that if I ask her to move out, she\xe2\x80\x99ll just dump me.\nPenny: Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s a chance you have to take. I mean, look, if it\xe2\x80\x99s meant to be, it\xe2\x80\x99ll be.\nLeonard: Very comforting. Okay, so what do I say to her?\nPenny: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I mean, what have women said to you when they wanted to slow a relationship down?\nLeonard: I really like you, but I want to see how things go with Mark?\nPenny: Yeah, that\xe2\x80\x99ll slow it down.\nScene: Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom. Leonard and Steph have just had sex.\n  Steph: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, I totally interrupted you. What were you saying?\nLeonard: Oh, right, yeah, um, so, Stephanie, here\xe2\x80\x99s the thing. I really like you.\nSteph: Oh, God, here comes the speech.\nLeonard: What speech?\nSteph: I really like you, but maybe we should spend a little less time together \xe2\x80\x98cause I need my space but I\xe2\x80\x99ll call you on Tuesday, and then you never call me so I call you, but you don\xe2\x80\x99t call me back and then when I run into you at the coffee shop you pretend like you\xe2\x80\x99ve been having problems with your voice mail and I know that you\xe2\x80\x99re lying, but I pretend like I don\xe2\x80\x99t care even though I\xe2\x80\x99m dying inside!\nLeonard: No! No, no! I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to say any of that. I was just going to say, I really like you.\nSteph: Oh. Oh, good! \xe2\x80\x98Cause I really like you, too.\nLeonard: Terrific.\nScene: The university cafeteria.\n  Leonard: Hey.\nRaj: Hey.\nHoward: Hey. Nice sweater.\nLeonard: Yeah, Stephanie got it for me. It\xe2\x80\x99s kind of fun.\nRaj: It\xe2\x80\x99s got a big bird on it, dude.\nLeonard: Yeah, yeah, that\xe2\x80\x99s the fun part. We\xe2\x80\x99re also getting new curtains for my bedroom, and a dust ruffle, and a duvet, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t even know what a duvet is but I\xe2\x80\x99m pretty sure if I did I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want one, but every time I talk to her about moving out she cries and we have sex.\nRaj: You\xe2\x80\x99re lucky. With me, it\xe2\x80\x99s usually the other way around.\nHoward: You know, if you can\xe2\x80\x99t talk to her, why don\xe2\x80\x99t you just text her?\nLeonard: Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that kind of cowardly?\nHoward: Oh, yeah. It\xe2\x80\x99s beyond contemptible.\nRaj: It\xe2\x80\x99s true, but on the other hand you are wearing a bird sweater.\nLeonard: Sold. \xe2\x80\x9cI think it would be better for our relationship if you moved back to your place.\xe2\x80\x9d There. It\xe2\x80\x99s done.\nHoward: Good for you.\nLeonard: Yeah, good for me. I\xe2\x80\x99ll never have sex again. (Phone buzzes) I was wrong. See ya.\nScene: Outside Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment. Sheldon has his laptop. He knocks three times, the presses a button and an electronic voice says \xe2\x80\x9cPenny\xe2\x80\x9d. He does this three times.\nPenny (opening door): Sheldon?\nComputer voice: I have an inflamed larynx.\nPenny: Okay?\nComputer voice: We\xe2\x80\x99re out of herbal tea. Do you have any?\nPenny: Okay, let me check.\nComputer voice: Some hiney would be nice, too.\nPenny: Hiney?\nComputer voice: Honey.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
