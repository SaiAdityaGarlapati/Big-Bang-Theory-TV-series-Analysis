b'Scene: The apartment. Sheldon is on the phone.\nSheldon: Buona sera, Luigi\xe2\x80\x99s Pizza. Buona sera. It means good evening in Italian. May I say, having to explain that to you calls into question the authenticity of your ristorante?\nLeonard: Okay, I\xe2\x80\x99m out of here.\nSheldon: Un momento. Oh, for heaven\xe2\x80\x99s sake, now you\xe2\x80\x99re being deliberately stupid. (to Leonard) Where are you going?\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m having dinner with Priya at Raj\xe2\x80\x99s. I think Howard\xe2\x80\x99s going to be there. You want to join us?\nSheldon: But tonight\xe2\x80\x99s Thursday. On Thursdays, everybody comes over here and has pizza. Or a reasonable facsimile prepared by someone claiming to be Luigi, but who sounds suspiciously like Jackie Chan.\nLeonard: Can\xe2\x80\x99t we make a one-time exception for tonight?\nSheldon: We could. We could also stop using the letter M, but I think that idea is isguided and oronic.\nLeonard: Just come with me to Raj\xe2\x80\x99s.\nSheldon: Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to go to a party.\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s not a party. It\xe2\x80\x99s the same group of people who hang out here, hanging out over there.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, but five people eating and chatting is a party.\nLeonard: How come it\xe2\x80\x99s not a party when we do it here?\nSheldon: Because we don\xe2\x80\x99t throw parties.\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to tell you, Sheldon. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to see Priya. Everyone\xe2\x80\x99s over there. You coming or not?\nSheldon: Well, no, sir, and do you know why? In a word, tradition. Every Thursday night for the last eight years, you and I and our friends have gathered here in this very spot to break bread covered with cheese and sauce, discuss the issues of the day, and yes, share a laugh or two. But I guess our rich heritage means nothing to you.\nLeonard: I guess you\xe2\x80\x99re right. See you later.\nSheldon: Wait! Leonard! Wait! What am I going to do for dinner?\nLeonard: Come with me to Raj\xe2\x80\x99s and eat there.\nSheldon: I can\xe2\x80\x99t do that. What if he serves haggis and blood pudding?\nLeonard: I really doubt that\xe2\x80\x99s what he\xe2\x80\x99ll serve.\nSheldon: But what if he does? I\xe2\x80\x99ll be obliged to dine on liver and lungs stuffed in a sheep\xe2\x80\x99s stomach. And frankly, blood pudding is essentially the same thing. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why he\xe2\x80\x99s serving both.\nLeonard: What do you want to do? You want to come with me, or do you want to sit here alone?\nSheldon: No, I\xe2\x80\x99ll go to your haggis party. But I\xe2\x80\x99m telling you, this is adness. This is utter and coplete adness.\nCredits sequence.\nSheldon: Oh, dear!\nLeonard: What?\nSheldon: Raj\xe2\x80\x99s television. I just realized we\xe2\x80\x99re about to spend an evening watching a plasma screen with a cluster of dead pixels in the upper left-hand corner.\nLeonard: So don\xe2\x80\x99t watch TV. Read a book.\nSheldon: And be a social pariah? Oh, you know that\xe2\x80\x99s not my style.\nLeonard: Ugh!\nSheldon: The audible sigh is a show of exasperation, right?\nLeonard: Right.\nSheldon: Is it about me or the dead pixels?\nRaj: Hey, you\xe2\x80\x99re just in time. We made Tex-Mex.\nLeonard: Oh, sounds great.\nSheldon: Oh, Indians making Tex-Mex. Might as well have had the Chinese pizza.\nPriya: Hey, you.\nLeonard: Hi.\nHoward: That\xe2\x80\x99s got to be fun for you, huh? Watching Hofstadter suck the saliva out of your sister\xe2\x80\x99s mouth?\nSheldon: Excuse me. Before this evening goes any further, we need to decide where everyone is going to sit.\nPriya: There is no assigned seats, Sheldon. Just sit anywhere. Make yourself comfortable.\nSheldon: Oh, what fun. We\xe2\x80\x99re like hippies at a love-in.\nLeonard: Just sit here.\nSheldon: Yeah, right on, man. Right on. Oh, look, it\xe2\x80\x99s Harry Potter and 98% of The Sorcerer\xe2\x80\x99s Stone.\nRaj: Okay, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got fajitas with all the fixins, so you make your own.\nSheldon: Wonderful. Dinner, some assembly required.\nPriya: Do you want a margarita, Sheldon?\nSheldon: A margarita? Where are we? What is happening?\nScene: The bar of the Cheesecake Factory\nPenny: Oh. Hey, Sheldon. What can I get ya?\nSheldon: Water. Neat. With a little umbrella.\nPenny: Where are all your friends?\nSheldon: Sadly, Penny, this evening, I am the Dark Knight, roaming these mean streets alone. A windbreaker for my cape, and a stern expression for my cowl.\nPenny: Okay.\nSheldon: Excuse me? Isn\xe2\x80\x99t this the point where the world-weary barkeep absentmindedly wipes down the bar and coaxes the woes out of the troubled patron?\nPenny: Well, I was getting your stupid umbrella, but all right. What\xe2\x80\x99s troubling you, buddy?\nSheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t think your heart\xe2\x80\x99s in it, but since you asked. Apparently, because Leonard is dating Raj\xe2\x80\x99s sister, we\xe2\x80\x99re all forced to hang out at his apartment.\nPenny: Oh, the horror.\nSheldon: Indeed. Yeah, at one point, Raj put on reggae music, and his sister took off her shoes. It was like the last days of Caligula. (Phone rings) Oh, I have to get this. Umbrella?\nPenny: Ugh!\nSheldon: Wonder what she\xe2\x80\x99s exasperated about. Hello?\nAmy (on phone): Sheldon, are you all right? When last we spoke, you were going to take a taxi home from Raj\xe2\x80\x99s, but according to Facebook, you just checked in at the Cheesecake Factory.\nSheldon: Yes, I was in a taxi, but the driver didn\xe2\x80\x99t look at all like the photograph on his license, so I leapt out and ran for it.\nAmy: Wise.\nPenny: There you go. Just like recovering alcoholics drink in the Caribbean.\nAmy: Hi, bestie.\nPenny: Oh. Hi, Amy. How you been?\nAmy: Fine. From this angle, I can see up your nose.\nPenny: Yeah, it\xe2\x80\x99s a great time to be alive, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\nSheldon: Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry. My problems can wait while you two hens finish your clucking.\nPenny: Look, Sheldon, Leonard is dating Priya. She is staying with Raj. That means you\xe2\x80\x99re all probably gonna be hanging out there more.\nAmy: Penny, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry you got dragged into this. I know you\xe2\x80\x99re devastated that your ex-boyfriend has found an exciting new lover with flawless, caramel-coloured skin.\nPenny: Okay, I\xe2\x80\x99m not upset about Leonard and Priya.\nAmy: Your flaring nostrils indicate otherwise.\nSheldon: Cluck-cluck-cluck.\nAmy: Sheldon, look at me. I think it\xe2\x80\x99s time to face the fact that Leonard is the nucleus of your social group. Where he goes, the group goes.\nSheldon: Leonard the nucleus? That makes no sense. I\xe2\x80\x99m the whimsical elf that everyone looks to for a good time.\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99m not saying that you\xe2\x80\x99re not fun. You\xe2\x80\x99re the most fun person I know.\nPenny: A lot of people think I\xe2\x80\x99m fun to be around.\nAmy: Don\xe2\x80\x99t be needy, bestie. That\xe2\x80\x99s probably part of what chased Leonard away. What I am saying, Sheldon, is that your group is Leonard-centric. If it were a town, it would be Leonardville. If it were an Islamic nation, Leonardstan. If it were the birthplace of motion pictures, we\xe2\x80\x99d all be singing Hooray for Leonardwood.\nPenny: Ooh, I got one. If you guys were a band, you\xe2\x80\x99d be called Leonard and the Leonards.\nAmy: So needy.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: What you doing?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m setting out snacks.\nLeonard: You do realize everyone\xe2\x80\x99s eating at Raj\xe2\x80\x99s again tonight?\nSheldon: I didn\xe2\x80\x99t say the snacks were for you now, did I, Nosy Rosie?\nLeonard: You\xe2\x80\x99re having people over?\nSheldon: Yes. Must be killing you wondering who. Fine, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you. Stuart from the comic bookstore, Barry Kripke from the university, Penny\xe2\x80\x99s ex-boyfriend Zack and TV\xe2\x80\x99s LeVar Burton.\nLeonard: Really? LeVar Burton\xe2\x80\x99s coming here?\nSheldon: Possibly. I Tweeted him.\nLeonard: Okay, well, tell him I loved him on Star Trek.\nSheldon: Please, Leonard, stop trying to horn in on my new friends.\nLeonard: Of course. Good night.\nSheldon: Leonard.\nLeonard: Yeah?\nSheldon: We had a good run, you and I.\nLeonard: Okay.\nSheldon: But change is a part of life.\nLeonard: It certainly is.\nSheldon: Okay. I have guests coming. I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid I\xe2\x80\x99m going to have to ask you to leave now.\nLeonard: I am leaving.\nSheldon: Don\xe2\x80\x99t make this harder than it is, Leonard.\nLeonard: Good-bye, Sheldon.\nSheldon: And good-bye to you, sir. He\xe2\x80\x99ll be back.\nLeonard: Of course I\xe2\x80\x99ll be back. I live here!\nScene: The apartment, later.\nSheldon: Well, it would appear LeVar Burton won\xe2\x80\x99t be joining us so let\xe2\x80\x99s get started. Um, I thought we\xe2\x80\x99d begin by going around the room, introducing ourselves and saying a little bit about why we\xe2\x80\x99re here. Okay. I\xe2\x80\x99m Sheldon. Uh, for regular readers of The New England Journal of High Energy Physics, I need no introduction. If you\xe2\x80\x99re not familiar with that publication, there\xe2\x80\x99s a free copy in your goody bag. Stuart?\nStuart: Um. Hi. I\xe2\x80\x99m Stuart. I run a comic bookstore, which for financial reasons, I\xe2\x80\x99m currently living in. And I guess what I\xe2\x80\x99m hoping for most out of tonight is a hot shower.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s very nice, Stuart. Zack?\nZack: I\xe2\x80\x99m Zack, and I\xe2\x80\x99m, uh\xe2\x80\xa6 uh\xe2\x80\xa6 could you come back to me?\nSheldon: Of course. Barry?\nBarry: I\xe2\x80\x99m Barry Kwipke, and I\xe2\x80\x99m here because you told me there was going to be a whaffle. When is the whaffle?\nSheldon: Patience, patience, Barry. The whaffle\xe2\x80\xa6 the raffle is the grand finale to an evening-long festival of fun and folly.\nBarry: One more question\xe2\x80\xa6\nSheldon: Yes, you must be present to win.\nZack: Okay, I\xe2\x80\x99m ready. I\xe2\x80\x99m Zack, and I\xe2\x80\x99m, uh\xe2\x80\xa6 oh, crap, why is this so hard?\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nPenny: Oh, hey.\nBernadette: Hi.\nAmy: Yo, P-dog.\nPenny: What\xe2\x80\x99s up?\nBernadette: We\xe2\x80\x99re here to kidnap you for a girls\xe2\x80\x99 night out.\nAmy: Parenthetical, the term kidnap is being used playfully.\nPenny: I kind of figured that.\nAmy: Good. Now put this pillowcase over your head.\nPenny: No.\nAmy: She used to be much more fun, until Leonard punched her in the heart.\nBernadette: We just thought you might want to go out and have a good time, maybe go dancing.\nPenny: Oh. Gee, thanks, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not really in the mood.\nAmy: You do understand that it will distract you from obsessing over the rich variety of sweet loving that your ex-boyfriend is currently receiving from the fiery jewel of Mumbai.\nPenny: Okay, look, if I agree to go out with you guys, will you promise to stop pestering me about Leonard and Priya?\nAmy: Yes.\nBernadette: Sure.\nPenny: All right. I\xe2\x80\x99ll go change. Come on in.\nAmy: If you\xe2\x80\x99d have let me bring the chloroform, we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have had to put up with all this jibber-jabber.\nScene: The apartment.\nZack: Anyway, after we get done snowboarding, I go back to the lodge and get in the Jacuzzi. There\xe2\x80\x99s no one around, so naturally, I\xe2\x80\x99m free-balling it. Next thing I know, this beautiful chick shows up, drunk out of her skull, wants to get in with me.\nSheldon: Question. Was it a Jacuzzi or a hot tub?\nBarry: Weally? That\xe2\x80\x99s your question?\nZack: What\xe2\x80\x99s the difference?\nSheldon: Jacuzzi is a commercial brand. Hot tub is the generic term, i.e., all Jacuzzis are hot tubs, but not all hot tubs are Jacuzzis.\nZack: Is that like all thumbs are fingers, but not all fingers are thumbs?\nSheldon: Surprisingly, yes.\nZack: Nice. Now, what exactly are toes?\nStuart: Can you please get back to the drunk girl? I\xe2\x80\x99d like something to think about in the shower.\nZack: Oh, yeah. Right. Anyway, she takes off all of her clothes, climbs into the hot tub, and the first thing I notice\xe2\x80\xa6\nSheldon: The water level rose.\nZack: No.\nSheldon: Of course it did. It\xe2\x80\x99s said that Archimedes, the ancient Greek mathematician, discovered the principle of displacement while taking a bath.\nBarry: Tewwific. Go ahead, Zack. Naked dwunk girl, fwee-balling, continue.\nSheldon: Forgive me, but I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll find my story is more interesting.\nBarry: Does yours have wet bweasts in it?\nSheldon: Better. It has a gold crown. You see, the king wondered how much gold was in it and charged Archimedes with coming up with the solution. Because the crown was irregularly shaped, there was no way to mathematically determine its volume. But, while bathing, Archimedes realized he could immerse the crown and measure the amount the water rose.\nZack: So, long story short, I nailed her.\nSheldon: When he finished, he shouted Eureka!\nZack: No, I always shout, Holy Moly! Don\xe2\x80\x99t know why. Just do.\nSheldon: All right, that concludes the getting to know you portion of the evening. Who\xe2\x80\x99s ready to play some vintage video games? And tonight\xe2\x80\x99s selections include ColecoVision\xe2\x80\x99s Smurf Rescue in Gargamel\xe2\x80\x99s Castle, Atari\xe2\x80\x99s Cookie Monster Munch, and for you text adventure aficionados, Zork. Pick me, pick me. I\xe2\x80\x99m fun.\nBarry: That all sucks the big haiwy meatball. How about I go get the kawaoke machine out of my car, get plastered and blow the woof off this place?\nZack: Great, I\xe2\x80\x99ll make a beer run.\nStuart: And I\xe2\x80\x99ll take a shower. We\xe2\x80\x99ll meet back here in fifteen.\nBarry: Check.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m unhappy.\nScene: Raj\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nLeonard: This is delicious. Where\xe2\x80\x99d you learn to make chili?\nPriya: When I was at university in England, my flatmate was from Texas.\nLeonard: I hope she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t anything like my flatmate from Texas.\nPriya: Sheldon is a bit quirky, isn\xe2\x80\x99t he?\nHoward: Oh, please. That crazy bastard\xe2\x80\x99s looking at quirky in the rearview mirror.\nLeonard: Did you know that, per our roommate agreement, I have to wash my feet before I get in the shower? And not in the sink. We each have special buckets.\nHoward: Raj, did you ever tell your sister about the time Sheldon got punched by Bill Gates?\nPriya: Oh, God, you\xe2\x80\x99re kidding.\nRaj: Nope. Gates gave a speech at the university. Sheldon went up to him afterwards and said, maybe if you weren\xe2\x80\x99t so distracted by sick children in Africa, you could have put a little more thought into Windows Vista.\xe2\x80\x9d\nLeonard: Bam. Right in the nose. Made me proud to own a PC.\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99d like to propose a toast to a rare and wonderful Sheldon-free evening.\nLeonard: Hear, hear.\nHoward: Cheers. You realize that\xe2\x80\x99s the first time we\xe2\x80\x99ve ever done that without having to listen to Sheldon tell us why it\xe2\x80\x99s called a toast?\nPriya: Why is it called a toast?\nLeonard: Oh, the ancient Romans put spiced toast in their punch bowls.\nRaj: Sheldon tells it better.\nLeonard: He kind of does.\nHoward: Yeah.\nLeonard: Aw, hell, I miss him.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nPenny: So, where do you guys want to go dancing?\nBernadette: We were hoping you\xe2\x80\x99d know a place.\nAmy: Yes, perhaps somewhere packed tightly with young, beautiful bodies sweating and writhing against each other in a glorious orgy of the flesh.\nPenny: Oh, yeah, I know that place. What do you think?\nAmy: That should display enough of your bosom to attract a new mate, or a hungry infant.\nPenny: Okay, let\xe2\x80\x99s go through this one more time. Just because Leonard has a new girlfriend does not mean I need to go out and hook up with some guy.\nBernadette: But you could if you wanted to, right?\nPenny: Well, yeah, I guess.\nBernadette: Pick out the hottest guy in the room, take him home, do unspeakable things to him, then kick him to the curb with a smile on his face and teeth marks on his heinie?\nPenny: More or less.\nAmy: What\xe2\x80\x99s that like?\nPenny: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. It\xe2\x80\x99s fun while you\xe2\x80\x99re doing it. And then after, it\xe2\x80\x99s mostly embarrassment, self-loathing and regret.\nBernadette: I would take that deal all day long.\nPenny: Yeah, well, it\xe2\x80\x99s not gonna happen tonight. You know, for the first time in my life, I am not in a relationship, and I\xe2\x80\x99m totally okay with it.\nAmy: You know, if being on your own is new to you, I\xe2\x80\x99d be happy to share some tension-relieving techniques for ladies I\xe2\x80\x99ve perfected over the years. For example, do you have an electric toothbrush?\nPenny: Um, no.\nAmy: You should get one.\nBernadette: What\xe2\x80\x99s that?\nAmy: It appears to be something preserved between two pieces of acrylic.\nPenny: Oh, it\xe2\x80\x99s a snowflake from the North Pole. Leonard gave it to me last year.\nBernadette: Oh, God, that is so romantic.\nPenny: Yeah, it was.\nBernadette: Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s really one of a kind.\nAmy: Saying that while holding a snowflake is a little bit heavy-handed, don\xe2\x80\x99t you think?\nPenny: Let me see that. Oh, screw it. I can deal with a little self-loathing. Let\xe2\x80\x99s go find me a heinie to bite.\nAmy: Outstanding. And if we fail, we can always stop at CVS and pick you out a nice toothbrush. I call mine Gerard.\nBernadette: That\xe2\x80\x99s kind of creepy.\nScene: The apartment. Barry and Zack are singing \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t Go Breaking My Heart\xe2\x80\x9d\n  Stuart: Anybody do Walking on Sunshine yet?\nSheldon: No.\nStuart: Dibs.\nScene: Raj\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nPriya: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, Sheldon bought a loom and learned how to weave?\nLeonard: He actually got pretty good. He made us all matching serapes.\nRaj: I still wear mine when there\xe2\x80\x99s a nip in the air.\nPriya: Now, was this before or after he adopted the 25 cats?\nLeonard: Long before the cats. I think it was around the time he tried to declare our apartment a sovereign nation. I still have some of the currency.\nSheldon (outside): (Knock, knock, knock) All my friends. (Knock, knock, knock) All my friends. (Knock, knock, knock) All my friends.\nHoward: I think it\xe2\x80\x99s like Beetlejuice. We said his name too many times.\nRaj: Come on in.\nSheldon: Thank you.\nLeonard: Hey. I thought you were with your new buddies.\nSheldon: I had to leave. They were having fun wrong.\nPriya: Come here, Sheldon. Sit here with me.\nSheldon: Thank you.\nPriya: Would you like some homemade chili?\nSheldon: Are there beans in it?\nPriya: Yes.\nSheldon: Then it\xe2\x80\x99s not chili. Real chili has no beans in it, but you\xe2\x80\x99re from a foreign land, so your ignorance is forgiven.\nPriya: Sheldon, do you want some or not?\nSheldon: Yes, please. Your girlfriend\xe2\x80\x99s a little short-tempered.\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99d like to propose a toast to friends, no matter how quirky.\nAll: Cheers.\nSheldon: Priya, do you know why this is called a toast?\nPriya: Actually, I do. I believe the Romans used to put spiced toast in their punch bowls.\nSheldon: She\xe2\x80\x99s also a bit of a know-it-all. Mmm. This is good. Whatever it is.\nScene: The apartment. Stuart is singing \xe2\x80\x9cWalking on Sunshine\xe2\x80\x9d. Barry and Zack are doing backing vocals.\n  LeVar Burton: Hello? I\xe2\x80\xa6 Oh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think so. I am so done with Twitter.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
