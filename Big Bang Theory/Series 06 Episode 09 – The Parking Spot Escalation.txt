b'Scene: The cafeteria.\nLeonard: They are not.\nRaj: They are, too.\nLeonard: Your hypothesis is completely disconfirmed by all the data. You\xe2\x80\x99re just clinging to it out of intellectual stubbornness.\nRaj: No, you\xe2\x80\x99re displaying a shocking ignorance of the subject matter. Mummies and zombies are the exact same thing.\nLeonard: Oh, yeah? Mummies are wrapped in bandages.\nRaj: That\xe2\x80\x99s called a fashion choice.\nLeonard: All right, you brought this on yourself. Sheldon, get him.\nSheldon: If a zombie bites you, you turn into a zombie. However, if a mummy bites you, all you turn into is some schmo with a mummy bite. So, like a zombie, that\xe2\x80\x99s been eaten from the waist down, you, sir, have no leg to stand on.\nLeonard: Good boy. Here\xe2\x80\x99s a cookie.\nSheldon: Oh, thank you.\nHoward: Hey, fellas, what\xe2\x80\x99s going on?\nLeonard: Oh, mummies and zombies again.\nHoward: Oh, they\xe2\x80\x99re not the same thing.\nLeonard: You get a cookie, too.\nHoward: Thanks. Guess who picked up his new car this morning?\nRaj: Congratulations. Does it have that new car smell?\nHoward: Yep. For as long as I can keep my mother out of it. If you want to check it out later, it\xe2\x80\x99s parked right out front, space 294.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, 294?\nHoward: Yeah.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s my parking spot.\nRaj: Why do you have a parking spot? You don\xe2\x80\x99t have a car. You don\xe2\x80\x99t even drive.\nSheldon: It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter. That\xe2\x80\x99s my spot.\nLeonard: Maybe they reassigned it because you never use it.\nSheldon: Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not using my nipples, either. Maybe they should reassign those.\nHoward: Sheldon, someday, if you get a car, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure they\xe2\x80\x99ll give you another parking space.\nSheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t want another parking space. I want my parking space. It\xe2\x80\x99s perfect. It\xe2\x80\x99s a corner spot, cutting the risk of door-dings in half. It\xe2\x80\x99s a mere 28 steps from the building entrance. The nearby tree provides shade on hot days and is also home to a delightful squirrel. Which is fortuitous because most squirrels are real jerks.\nHoward: Fun story. Meanwhile, you still don\xe2\x80\x99t have a car.\nSheldon: Don\xe2\x80\x99t try to change the subject. This is about a parking space. It has nothing to do with cars.\nHoward: Are you listening to yourself?\nSheldon: I always listen to myself. It\xe2\x80\x99s one of the great joys of my life. Now, get your car out of my spot.\nHoward: Nope.\nSheldon: Very well. You leave me no choice.\nScene: The parking spot. Sheldon is trying to push Howard\xe2\x80\x99s car out of the spot.\nSheldon: What are you looking at, you stupid squirrel?\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon (on phone): President Siebert, listen to reason. Yeah, I understand I don\xe2\x80\x99t use the parking spot, but that\xe2\x80\x99s not the point. I\xe2\x80\xa6 Yes, I\xe2\x80\x99m aware you told me not to call you at home, but you didn\xe2\x80\x99t answer the door. And I know you were there, because I saw you through the mail slot. Yeah, well, that\xe2\x80\x99s some salty language. May I remind you that you\xe2\x80\x99re the president of a major university, not the president of the Potty Mouth Club. There it is again. Do you kiss your mother with that mouth? Oh, well, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry for your loss. Good night, sir. Unbelievable. He says Wolowitz deserves my spot because he\xe2\x80\x99s a high-profile asset to the university.\nLeonard: Well, he\xe2\x80\x99s not wrong. Howard did go to the International Space Station.\nSheldon: Yeah, that was five weeks ago. How much longer is he gonna milk that cow?\nLeonard: Sheldon, let it go. It\xe2\x80\x99s not a big deal.\nSheldon: No, no, this is a slippery slope, Leonard. It starts with a parking space, where does it end? It\xe2\x80\x99s like my dad always said, first they say you can\xe2\x80\x99t drink and drive, next thing you know, you can\xe2\x80\x99t let your 10-year-old take the wheel while you sleep one off in the backseat.\nLeonard: All that story does is make me feel bad for your mother.\nSheldon: Leonard, you\xe2\x80\x99re my best friend. Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you ever take my side?\nLeonard: Because I can never understand your side.\nScene: Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s office.\nHoward: Give it back.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, but could you be more specific?\nHoward: My Iron Man helmet. Koothrappali saw you take it. Give it back.\nSheldon: Oh, that. Well, see, I wanted it, and you weren\xe2\x80\x99t using it. Apparently, those are the rules we live by now. Payback, it truly is the B word, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\nHoward: Sheldon, that is a five hundred dollar limited edition collectible, and I want it back.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99d love to help you out, but unfortunately (puts helmet on), I\xe2\x80\x99m using it.\nHoward: Fine. I\xe2\x80\x99m taking your diploma.\nSheldon: Go ahead. That\xe2\x80\x99s the only doctorate you\xe2\x80\x99ll ever get. It smells funny in here.\nScene: The apartment stairwell.\nBernadette: We\xe2\x80\x99re so proud of you, Amy. Your first bikini wax.\nPenny: Yeah. So, how you doing?\nAmy: A little sensitive, but not bad. Does it always take that long?\nPenny: Uh, no, they usually don\xe2\x80\x99t have to go out and get more wax.\nAmy: I feel like I\xe2\x80\x99m five pounds lighter.\nBernadette: Really? Only five?\nPenny: Hey, anybody want a drink?\nAmy: Sure.\nBernadette: Okay. So, did you spend last night hearing about this silly parking space fight, too?\nAmy: For hours. Fortunately, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t understand most of it \xe2\x80\x99cause Sheldon was wearing that stupid robot mask.\nBernadette: Howard was so angry I had to mash up Benadryl in his ice cream to get him to fall asleep.\nAmy: I guess this is what we get for being with two testosterone-fueled alpha males. At some point, they\xe2\x80\x99re bound to lock horns.\nPenny: I\xe2\x80\x99m assuming these are some kind of horns they bought at Comic-Con?\nBernadette: I\xe2\x80\x99m really sorry they took Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s spot away. He shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have to suffer just because Howard\xe2\x80\x99s such a big deal now.\nAmy: I know, Sheldon should just let Howard have his little moment in the sun.\nBernadette: What\xe2\x80\x99s that supposed to mean?\nAmy: Well, I mean, Howard\xe2\x80\x99s never gonna go to space again, but Sheldon will always be a genius.\nBernadette: You\xe2\x80\x99re right. And I\xe2\x80\x99m sure Sheldon will get a fancy parking spot again, if and when he makes a worthwhile contribution to science.\nAmy: If and when?\nPenny: Okay, maybe we should change the subject. Um, Amy, how are your lady parts? Still chilly down there?\nBernadette: Hang on. None of Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s theories have ever been definitively proven. My husband actually went to outer space.\nAmy: That\xe2\x80\x99s an impressive accomplishment. He\xe2\x80\x99s now an inspiration to millions of Americans who know you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to be special or even qualified to go into space.\nPenny: You know, I remember the first time I got a bikini wax. My sister did it with melted Crayolas and duct tape. It\xe2\x80\x99s a bad idea.\nBernadette: Gosh, Amy. I\xe2\x80\x99m sensing a little hostility. Is it maybe because, like Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s work, your sex life is also theoretical?\nPenny: Damn.\nAmy: Yeah, well, at least when we do make love, Sheldon won\xe2\x80\x99t be thinking about his mother. And yes, that is a cleverly veiled reference to Howard\xe2\x80\x99s lifelong obsession to crawl back into her spacious womb.\nPenny: Anyway, to this day, I still can\xe2\x80\x99t see a box of crayons without crossing my legs.\nBernadette: I don\xe2\x80\x99t have to take this. I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna go home and have sex with my husband right now. Maybe I\xe2\x80\x99ll let him do it to me in the parking spot. Which sounds dirty, but I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean it that way,\nScene: The stairwell.\nRaj: Okay, here\xe2\x80\x99s another one: If a zombie bites a vampire, and the vampire bites a human, does the human become a vampire or a zombie? Or a zompire?\nLeonard: Sheldon?\nSheldon: Cookie.\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any.\nSheldon: Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not giving it away. (Enters apartment. Howard is sitting naked in his spot with a laptop on his lap)\nHoward: Hi Sheldon.\nSheldon: He\xe2\x80\x99s in my spot. Leonard, make him stop being naked in my spot.\nLeonard: Howard, what are you doing?\nHoward: He wasn\xe2\x80\x99t using it. And I needed a nice cool piece of leather to wiggle my naked ass on.\nSheldon: Get off there.\nHoward: Give me back my Iron Man helmet.\nSheldon: Give me back my parking space.\nHoward: You don\xe2\x80\x99t need a parking space. You don\xe2\x80\x99t have a car.\nSheldon: You don\xe2\x80\x99t need an Iron Man helmet. You\xe2\x80\x99re not Iron Man.\nHoward: Well, we appear to have reached an impasse. And you know, I have to say, I thought you\xe2\x80\x99d be more upset that your laptop is sitting on my junk.\nRaj: I didn\xe2\x80\x99t pick up on that. That\xe2\x80\x99s a nice touch.\nLeonard: Mmm.\nScene: The parking spot. Sheldon is spraypainting out Howard\xe2\x80\x99s name and replacing it with his own.\nAmy: This is so exciting. I\xe2\x80\x99m feeling all tingly. Although that could just be my newly defoliated bikini zone.\nSheldon: Keep a lookout. This place is swarming with campus security. They will not hesitate to scold us.\nAmy: Freaking pigs.\nSheldon: Oh, yeah. Okay, now, pull your car into the spot and let\xe2\x80\x99s get out of here.\nAmy: Wait, I\xe2\x80\x99m leaving my car here?\nSheldon: Yes, and be sure and put on the emergency brake. Really makes these things tough to budge.\nAmy: Before I park, come in the back seat. I want to show you something I had done today.\nSheldon: All right, colour me intrigued.\nAmy: What do you think?\nSheldon: I think you\xe2\x80\x99re high on paint fumes. And boy, that\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of Band-Aids.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nPenny: Okay, Howard\xe2\x80\x99s mother is in, like, every one of your wedding photos.\nBernadette: What can I tell ya? She\xe2\x80\x99s a big girl. Wherever you look, there she is. More coffee?\nPenny: No, Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s taking me to a physics lecture, and coffee\xe2\x80\x99ll just keep me awake. (Knock on door) Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99ll get it.\nAmy: Oh, looks like someone\xe2\x80\x99s on Team Bernadette. Where\xe2\x80\x99s Howard?\nBernadette: He\xe2\x80\x99s not here. What\xe2\x80\x99s wrong?\nAmy: He had my car towed. It cost me two hundred dollars to get it back.\nBernadette: Oh, no. Where was it parked?\nAmy: In Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s spot.\nBernadette: That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make sense. Sheldon doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have a spot. Was it maybe in Howard\xe2\x80\x99s spot?\nAmy: Don\xe2\x80\x99t play dumb with me, sister. You tell your husband he owes me two hundred dollars.\nBernadette: Well, that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make sense, either.\nAmy: Why not?\nBernadette: Because I\xe2\x80\x99m the one who had it towed.\nAmy: You?\nBernadette: Didn\xe2\x80\x99t see that one coming, did ya?\nAmy: Oh, yeah? Well, you\xe2\x80\x99re not gonna see this coming. (Swings handbag. Bernadette ducks. Penny is hit in the face)\nPenny: Ow! Ow!\nAmy: Oh, my God,\nBernadette: Are you okay?!\nPenny: You idiot, what the hell do you have in there?!\nAmy: Just my wallet, keys and a coffee can full of change I\xe2\x80\x99ve been meaning to take to the bank.\nBernadette: Don\xe2\x80\x99t move. I\xe2\x80\x99ll get some ice.\nAmy: Are you okay?\nPenny: Get away from me or I swear to God I will rip out what\xe2\x80\x99s left of your pubes!\nBernadette: Here.\nPenny: Thanks. Ah!\nBernadette: Amy, you think maybe this has gotten a little out of hand?\nPenny: Gee, you think?\nAmy: I do. Penny, Bernadette and I are sorry.\nBernadette: You hit her! What did I do?\nAmy: You had my car towed.\nBernadette: You were parked in Howard\xe2\x80\x99s spot.\nAmy: I was parked in Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s spot.\nBernadette: Sheldon doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have a spot.\nPenny: Guys, I think I need to go to the emergency room.\nBernadette: Okay, let\xe2\x80\x99s go.\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99ll drive. You can see where the tow truck scratched my car.\nBernadette: The tow truck didn\xe2\x80\x99t scratch your car.\nAmy: How do you know?\nBernadette: \xe2\x80\x98Cause I did it!\nScene: The parking spot. Sheldon has set up his office in it.\nSheldon: Morning, Professor Stevens. Don\xe2\x80\x99t look at that whiteboard. That\xe2\x80\x99s my math, not your math. Keep walking, nosey.\nHoward: What the hell are you doing?\nSheldon: Oh. You said I\xe2\x80\x99m not using my space, so I\xe2\x80\x99m using it.\nHoward: Okay, you need to move now.\nSheldon: No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t.\nHoward: You can\xe2\x80\x99t stay there forever.\nSheldon: Actually, I have a plastic baggy strapped to my leg that says I can. Give up, Wolowitz. You\xe2\x80\x99ve chosen to tangle with a superior intellect you can\xe2\x80\x99t defeat. There is nothing you could possibly do to\xe2\x80\xa6 (Howard starts sounding his horn. Sheldon puts on earphones)\nHoward: Those aren\xe2\x80\x99t gonna help you, Sheldon,\nSheldon: Oh, yes, they are. I mean, what?\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m warning you, Sheldon!\nSheldon: Your threats are empty, nothing can move me. (Howard starts pushing his chair with the front of the car) Stop that.\nHoward: Get out of my spot.\nSheldon: No. That\xe2\x80\x99s it. I am calling campus security. You prepare for the scolding of your life.\nLeonard: What are you idiots doing?\nSheldon: He\xe2\x80\x99s trying to kill me, Leonard. Video games and rock music have desensitized him to violence.\nHoward: Would you please talk some sense into your lunatic roommate?\nLeonard: You\xe2\x80\x99re both acting like lunatics. It\xe2\x80\x99s just a parking spot.\nHoward: It\xe2\x80\x99s not just a parking spot. He can\xe2\x80\x99t handle the fact that I\xe2\x80\x99m a bigger deal than he is now.\nSheldon: Oh, preposterous. I have been solely responsible for this university\xe2\x80\x99s six loop quantum gravity calculations, I have changed the way we think about Bose-Einstein condensates, and I am also the one who got Nutter Butters in the cafeteria vending machine. Maybe you missed that news while you were floating around like a goof in outer space. Now, if you\xe2\x80\x99ll excuse me, I have work to do.\nHoward: Can you believe this guy?\nLeonard: What I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe is that you tried to run him over.\nHoward: Oh, like you\xe2\x80\x99ve never thought of doing that. Don\xe2\x80\x99t hate me just because I lived the dream. (Horn beeps. Sheldon is sitting naked in Howard\xe2\x80\x99s car.)\nSheldon: Hey, sweet ride.\nHoward: What are you doing in there?\nSheldon: Just breaking in your new car.\nHoward: Stop that. You stop that.\nSheldon: You know what they say? Revenge is a dish best served nude.\nScene: Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s office.\nRaj: Hey, got a minute?\nSheldon: Oh, of course, come in. (Raj opens door to reveal Howard) This is an authentic Chinese throwing star, and I must warn you, I have seen many people throw them in movies.\nRaj: Calm down. Howard has something he wants to say to you.\nHoward: All right. Sheldon, when this whole thing with the parking space started, I had no idea just how much of a crazy bastard\xe2\x80\xa6\nRaj: Howard, that\xe2\x80\x99s not how we practiced it.\nHoward: I had no idea how much that spot meant to you. Anyway, I called President Siebert and told him it\xe2\x80\x99s not worth fighting over the spot, so you keep it, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll park in the structure across the street.\nSheldon: Well, Howard, thank you. It\xe2\x80\x99s quite a gesture on your part. You\xe2\x80\x99ve shown yourself to be the bigger man.\nHoward: Thank you.\nSheldon: Which I find totally unacceptable. I must be the bigger man. Therefore, you may use my spot until such time as I learn to drive or get a Batmobile.\nHoward: Wow, okay. Well, thanks. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to say.\nSheldon: There is nothing to say. Except I\xe2\x80\x99m the bigger man. I\xe2\x80\x99m not kidding. Say it.\nRaj: Just say it.\nHoward: You\xe2\x80\x99re the bigger man, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Oh, stop. And I believe this is yours. FYI, if you wear that into a bank, they will tackle you to the ground.\nScene: The cheesecake factory.\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99d like to propose a toast, to burying the hatchet.\nSheldon: To burying the hatchet.\nBernadette: You know, I\xe2\x80\x99m kind of glad this happened.\nAmy: Me, too. In some weird way, I kind of feel like it brought us closer.\nPenny (with two black eyes and a plaster across her nose): Yeah, everybody\xe2\x80\x99s happy, great.\nScene: A dry cleaners.\nShopkeeper: Can I help you?\nSheldon: Yes. According to information I gleaned from Yelp, you had great success when a santeriasuzy37 brought you a pair of leather slacks stained with chicken blood. I believe I may have a similar problem. This cushion experienced a nude revenge wiggle.\nShopkeeper: A what?\nSheldon: A naked man sat on it. Now, here\xe2\x80\x99s my concern, his diet is rich in fatty deli meats. What test do you have to detect lipid residue?\nShopkeeper: Lipid what?\nSheldon: Lipid residue. An anal autograph. A colon calling card, if you will.\nShopkeeper: Tuesday okay?\nSheldon: Don\xe2\x80\x99t rush it. We may be dealing with befoulment on a molecular level.\nShopkeeper: Let me write you a ticket.\nSheldon: Is that your son?\nShopkeeper: Uh-huh.\nSheldon: Looks like that laptop\xe2\x80\x99s seen better days. If you\xe2\x80\x99re interested, I\xe2\x80\x99m selling this. It\xe2\x80\x99s only two years old, 16 gigabytes of RAM, Intel core i7 processor, and I can personally guarantee it has spent less than 20 minutes resting on an astronaut\xe2\x80\x99s penis.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
