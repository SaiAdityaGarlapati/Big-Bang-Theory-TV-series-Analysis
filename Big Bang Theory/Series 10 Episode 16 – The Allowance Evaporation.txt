b'Scene: The apartment.\nHoward: Go. Come on, Raj.\nLeonard: You can do this.\nSheldon: There\xe2\x80\x99s no way.\nPenny: What is happening?\nLeonard: This is an Euler\xe2\x80\x99s Disk. It\xe2\x80\x99s a physics toy that demonstrates angular momentum, potential energy, and kinetic energy.\nPenny: Aw, look at you watching sports.\nHoward: We\xe2\x80\x99re betting to see if Koothrappali can hold his breath longer than the disk can spin.\nSheldon: Its weight and smoothness, along with the slight concavity of the mirror, means it can spin for a long time.\nLeonard: But Raj is from India, which means he\xe2\x80\x99s no slouch at holding his breath.\nPenny: Okay, I want in. Ten bucks says I\xe2\x80\x99ll lose interest before that thing stops spinning.\nAmy: Hey, Sheldon, I found a great restaurant for date night.\nSheldon: Kind of busy right now.\nAmy: Oh, an Euler\xe2\x80\x99s Disk, fun.\nHoward: Yeah, we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing if Raj can hold his breath longer than it.\nAmy: Oh. Immature.\nLeonard: How ya doing?\nSheldon: He\xe2\x80\x99s not gonna make it.\nHoward: Yes, he is.\nSheldon: You know, deep-sea divers holding their breath for several minutes have shown elevated markers of a protein that can signal brain damage.\nPenny: Yeah, see, what\xe2\x80\x99s happening here signals brain damage. My God, how long does this thing spin for?\nHoward: Ha, you\xe2\x80\x99re interested. You\xe2\x80\x99re out ten bucks.\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s slowing down.\nLeonard: Dig deep, like when we bet you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t fit into Howard\xe2\x80\x99s pants.\nSheldon: He\xe2\x80\x99s not gonna make it.\nLeonard: Yes, he is.\nHoward: Come on, Raj, it\xe2\x80\x99s like your favourite movie, you\xe2\x80\x99re just Waiting to Exhale. Yeah, I knew you could do it.\nRaj: And j, and just so you know, my favourite movie is Princess Bride.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: Raj\xe2\x80\x99s office.\nDr Koothrapalli (on skype): Hello, Rajesh. How are things by you?\nRaj: Good, good. Uh, listen, I just wanted to let you know when you get my credit card bill, it might be a little high this month.\nDr Koothrapalli: Well, you\xe2\x80\x99re a grown man with a steady job. Why wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you spend all your father\xe2\x80\x99s money?\nRaj: Oh, Daddy, you\xe2\x80\x99re so rich and funny.\nDr Koothrapalli: Yeah. So what else is going on with your life?\nRaj: Uh, well, I was dating a woman at the university, but we broke up.\nDr Koothrapalli: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry to hear that.\nRaj: I know you are. That\xe2\x80\x99s why you just bought me a new iPad. And before you start, I am not interested in you arranging a marriage for me.\nDr Koothrapalli: Oh, I gave up on that a long time ago.\nRaj: You did?\nDr Koothrapalli: It\xe2\x80\x99s too much work. You\xe2\x80\x99re an adult who can\xe2\x80\x99t get by without an allowance from his parents. Women don\xe2\x80\x99t want that.\nRaj: What are you saying, that you\xe2\x80\x99re giving up on me? What kind of father gives up on his son?\nDr Koothrapalli: I have six children, five of whom are married and self-sufficient. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I\xe2\x80\x99m the problem.\nRaj: I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe what I\xe2\x80\x99m hearing. This is deeply hurtful.\nDr Koothrapalli: You\xe2\x80\x99re also too sensitive. Women don\xe2\x80\x99t want that either.\nScene: A restaurant.\nAmy: The food here\xe2\x80\x99s supposed to be great. Don\xe2\x80\x99t fill up on chips.\nSheldon: Oh, I won\xe2\x80\x99t. I only eat equilateral triangles. Isosceles, isosceles, oh, scalene. You didn\xe2\x80\x99t see that.\nAmy: Oh, look. It\xe2\x80\x99s Bert, at the bar. We should go say hi.\nSheldon: Why?\nAmy: Because that\xe2\x80\x99s what you do when you see someone you know in a public place.\nSheldon: I have multiple restraining orders that say otherwise.\nAmy: Sheldon, there\xe2\x80\x99s a difference between greeting a friend and following a celebrity into a bathroom.\nSheldon: If the judge couldn\xe2\x80\x99t explain it to me, I don\xe2\x80\x99t see how you will.\nAmy: Hi, Bert.\nSheldon: Hello.\nBert: Oh, hey, guys. What brings you here?\nAmy: Oh, we\xe2\x80\x99re having date night.\nBert: Nice. I\xe2\x80\x99m meeting someone, too.\nAmy: Oh, really. Anybody we know?\nBert: I doubt it. I met her on G-Harmony. That\xe2\x80\x99s a Web site for geologists to find love.\nAmy: That\xe2\x80\x99s a real thing?\nBert: Yeah. Their slogan is we\xe2\x80\x99re all about dating and not the carbon-14 kind.\nSheldon: Well, have a lovely evening.\nBert: Thanks. You, too.\nSheldon: If you think that\xe2\x80\x99s more fun than talking to Zachary Quinto through a stall door, you\xe2\x80\x99re crazy.\nScene: The apartment.\nPenny: You know, we could\xe2\x80\x99ve come to you guys. You didn\xe2\x80\x99t have to bring the baby here.\nBernadette: Oh, it\xe2\x80\x99s okay. It\xe2\x80\x99s good to get out of the house.\nHoward: And the car ride puts her to sleep.\nLeonard: Aw, that used to work with Sheldon.\nPenny: Yeah, until someone left him in the drugstore parking lot and he freaked out.\nLeonard: Who forgot to crack the window?\nRaj: Hello.\nLeonard: Hey.\nPenny: Oh, someone\xe2\x80\x99s been shopping at Gucci.\nRaj: Yeah, I saw something for Halley and I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t resist.\nBernadette: That\xe2\x80\x99s so sweet of you.\nRaj: Yeah, it\xe2\x80\x99s a crushed velvet baby cape.\nHoward: Oh, no, now we have two.\nPenny: That must\xe2\x80\x99ve been expensive.\nRaj: Yeah, it was. But it\xe2\x80\x99s my father\xe2\x80\x99s money and I\xe2\x80\x99m mad at him.\nLeonard: What\xe2\x80\x99s going on with your dad?\nPenny: And if you really want to hurt him, I look great in Chanel.\nRaj: It turns out he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t care if I\xe2\x80\x99m married or if I\xe2\x80\x99m single. He\xe2\x80\x99s basically given up on me.\nBernadette: Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that\xe2\x80\x99s not true.\nRaj: It is. He stopped trying to find Indian girls for me to marry.\nLeonard: But all you did was complain when he did that.\nPenny: Wait, Leonard, he\xe2\x80\x99s hurting. Let him feel how he feels.\nRaj: Thank you, Penny.\nPenny: Yeah. Shoes, I\xe2\x80\x99m a seven-and-a-half, boots, I\xe2\x80\x99m an eight.\nScene: The restaurant.\nSheldon: MSN Search, AltaVista, and Ask Jeeves. You?\nAmy: Sorry, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a list of defunct search engines that I miss.\nBert: Hey. Looks like I got stood up, so I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna head out.\nAmy: Oh, no. Are you sure you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to give her a few more minutes?\nBert: Nah, G-Harmony recommends after two hours, it\xe2\x80\x99s time to cut bait.\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99m so sorry.\nSheldon: Bert, I insist that you join us.\nBert: You really wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t mind?\nSheldon: Not at all. Amy?\nAmy: Fine with me.\nBert: Thanks. I\xe2\x80\x99ll go grab a chair.\nAmy: Sheldon, that was so sweet of you.\nSheldon: Well, I could deduce by his facial expression and body language that he was sad.\nAmy: So the part where he got stood up didn\xe2\x80\x99t clue you in?\nSheldon: You want me to look at him and listen to him?\nScene: The apartment.\nRaj: My father thinks the reason I can\xe2\x80\x99t make a relationship work is because I\xe2\x80\x99m spoiled.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, is he waiting for someone to disagree?\nRaj: Just because he helps me out doesn\xe2\x80\x99t automatically mean that I\xe2\x80\x99m spoiled.\nPenny: All right, how much exactly does he pay for?\nRaj: Okay, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you, but please don\xe2\x80\x99t judge me. He pays for my car, my rent, and my credit cards.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m trying, but I\xe2\x80\x99m judging.\nHoward: Maybe your dad\xe2\x80\x99s right.\nPenny: Yeah, women do like a man that can support himself.\nRaj: But Bernadette makes more money than Howard. She basically supports him.\nBernadette: Yeah, maybe your dad\xe2\x80\x99s right.\nScene: The restaurant.\nBert: Good question. Let\xe2\x80\x99s see. Infoseek, WebCrawler, oh, HotBot.\nAmy: Okay, literally any other topic.\nBert: All right. How did you guys meet?\nSheldon: Actually, we met online.\nAmy: Our-our first date was at a coffee shop.\nSheldon: Although, unlike your date, she actually showed up. Oh, he looks sad again.\nBert: Well, I really envy your relationship. Other than you two only having sex once a year, you\xe2\x80\x99re the perfect couple.\nAmy: You-you know about that?\nBert: Uh, yeah, everyone at the university does.\nAmy: Were you aware of this?\nSheldon: No. No, I only told Leonard, Howard, Raj, Kripke, uh, Professor Wu, Professor Klein, and a lunch lady in the cafeteria. How everyone else found out is a mystery to me.\nScene: The stairwell.\nSheldon: Why aren\xe2\x80\x99t you talking to me?\nAmy: Because I\xe2\x80\x99m mad at you.\nSheldon: Oh. Well, now I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry I asked.\nAmy: Sheldon, it\xe2\x80\x99s humiliating. Thanks to you, my colleagues are gossiping about our sex life.\nSheldon: What is there to gossip about? We barely have one.\nAmy: That\xe2\x80\x99s why they\xe2\x80\x99re doing it.\nSheldon: Is it safe to assume you\xe2\x80\x99re not speaking to me again? If you\xe2\x80\x99re not answering because you\xe2\x80\x99re not speaking to me, perhaps we could come up with a signal. That works.\nScene: The apartment.\nHoward: You don\xe2\x80\x99t need your dad\xe2\x80\x99s money. You can get by on your salary.\nLeonard: Yeah. Well, we work at the same place as you, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve always been fine.\nRaj: Oh, please. Look in the mirror. You both look ten years older than I do.\nPenny: All right, hang on. We can figure this out. Let\xe2\x80\x99s just go over your expenses. How much is your rent?\nRaj: I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to say.\nBernadette: Is it really that high?\nRaj: I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to say because I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how much it is.\nPenny: You don\xe2\x80\x99t how much your rent is?\nRaj: My father pays for it. Do you know how much your rent is?\nPenny: Yeah.\nRaj: Well, then double it, because my building\xe2\x80\x99s a lot nicer than this dump.\nLeonard: Do you know how much your car costs?\nRaj: Not really.\nHoward: Well, how much do you spend on food?\nRaj: The housekeeper does the shopping.\nBernadette: Oh, my God, you really are spoiled.\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99m spoiled? Your baby has a cape that costs $300.\nScene: Sheldon and Amy\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99m going to bed.\nSheldon: Well, wait. This is our first fight as a couple who live together.\nAmy: So?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure of the protocol. Television teaches us that the man\xe2\x80\x99s supposed to sleep on the couch, but of the two of us, you\xe2\x80\x99re clearly more sofa-sized.\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99m not sleeping on the couch because you don\xe2\x80\x99t know what\xe2\x80\x99s private and what\xe2\x80\x99s not.\nSheldon: This isn\xe2\x80\x99t fair. You\xe2\x80\x99ve discussed aspects of our physical relationship with Penny.\nAmy: That\xe2\x80\x99s different. She\xe2\x80\x99s a close friend, not the lady in the cafeteria who cuts the crust off your sandwiches.\nSheldon: That lady has a name. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what it is, but one time I accidentally called her mom.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: Sounds like you\xe2\x80\x99re gonna need a cheaper place to live.\nBernadette: When you moved here, you didn\xe2\x80\x99t have a lot of money. How\xe2\x80\x99d you get by?\nPenny: Well, sometimes you can get free food and Wi-Fi from the neighbours. Just know you might have to marry one of \xe2\x80\x99em.\nLeonard: Hey, you guys let Stuart live with you. Why not Raj, too?\nHoward: What, what are you doing? I, I, I schlepped the baby over, I brought imported beer. Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you like me?\nRaj: I thought we were best friends?\nHoward: We are, that\xe2\x80\x99s why I\xe2\x80\x99m sad my best friend\xe2\x80\x99s gonna be homeless.\nBernadette: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, Raj. We really just don\xe2\x80\x99t have the space.\nLeonard: What if he lives in your garage?\nBernadette: What if you stop helping?\nRaj: Guys, I\xe2\x80\x99m not living in a garage.\nHoward: Wait. Why are we talking about our place when Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s old room is sitting there perfectly empty?\nBernadette: That\xe2\x80\x99s a great idea.\nPenny: Raj, if you need a place to stay, of course you are welcome here.\nRaj: Thank you, but if I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna just take advantage of my friends, I might as well keep on relying on my father.\nPenny: Okay, only if you\xe2\x80\x99re sure. Whew.\nLeonard: Yeah.\nScene: Sheldon and Amy\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom.\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Amy? (Knock, knock, knock) Amy? (Knock, knock, knock) Amy?\nAmy: Yeah?\nSheldon: Not exactly the welcome wagon, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll take it.\nAmy: What is this?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m mapping basic topics of conversation and with whom they can be discussed. I call these circles zones of privacy. Don\xe2\x80\x99t Google that unless you want to see pictures of people\xe2\x80\x99s genitals. This circle contains only me and you. It represents subjects we only share with each other, details of physical intimacy, bathroom habits. Although, as I\xe2\x80\x99m saying it, I may need to add Dr. Fink in here.\nAmy: Are you really worried about revealing secrets to Stephen Hawking?\nSheldon: No, I was just excited to list him as a friend.\nAmy: Well, I do appreciate you working on this.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry you were embarrassed. And now I understand that some things are just between you and me, and in the event of redness and swelling, Dr. Fink.\nAmy: What\xe2\x80\x99s that little dot in the middle?\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s reserved for thoughts I don\xe2\x80\x99t share with anyone.\nAmy: Interesting. You really have secrets you don\xe2\x80\x99t tell me?\nSheldon: Of course.\nAmy: Can I hear one?\nSheldon: No, they\xe2\x80\x99re private.\nAmy: Why? Are they naughty?\nSheldon: A little.\nAmy: Please?\nSheldon: Fine. Two years ago I got my driver\xe2\x80\x99s license.\nAmy: What? Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you say anything?\nSheldon: I like being chauffeured around. It makes me feel important.\nAmy: So when I got up at 4am. to drive you across the desert to an antique train museum, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t have to?\nSheldon: No, you didn\xe2\x80\x99t. But keep in mind, I felt extremely important.\nScene: Raj\xe2\x80\x99s office.\nDr Koothrapalli (on skype): What?\nRaj: Hello, Father. We need to talk.\nDr Koothrapalli: All right.\nRaj: I have come to an important decision. I will not be accepting your money any more. I\xe2\x80\x99m a man, and I can take care of myself.\nDr Koothrapalli: That\xe2\x80\x99s wonderful.\nRaj: Yes, that is wonderful. You will no longer be able to accuse me of being spoiled.\nDr Koothrapalli: I am so proud of you.\nRaj: Dad, I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to tell you off, and you\xe2\x80\x99re ruining it with your delight and relief.\nDr Koothrapalli: Sorry. Oh, no, my grown son is going to stop spending all my money. Where did I fail as a father?\nRaj: Yeah, that\xe2\x80\x99s right. Keep asking yourself that. But I still love you very much, so don\xe2\x80\x99t cut me out of the will.\nScene: The cafeteria.\nLeonard: Oh, you brought your own lunch. Good for you.\nRaj: Yeah, I\xe2\x80\x99m making a bunch of changes. This morning, I fired my dog walker.\nHoward: Oh. How\xe2\x80\x99s the dog gonna go to the bathroom?\nRaj: Uh, I gave her an Imodium. That\xe2\x80\x99s tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s problem.\nSheldon: Excuse me. May I have your attention, please? I have recently been made aware that my personal relationship with Amy Farrah Fowler has become water cooler gossip. And I just want to say, shame on all of you. We\xe2\x80\x99re scientists. Our minds should be focused on the advancement of human knowledge, not the intimate details of other people\xe2\x80\x99s lives.\nBert: He\xe2\x80\x99s right. And I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry for the part I played in this.\nSheldon: Thank you, Bert. You\xe2\x80\x99re a good man. That woman who stood you up and humiliated you last night really missed out.\nBert: That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t paint me in the best light.\nSheldon: Oh. Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. Correction, that woman not only had vigorous coitus with Bert, she also tipped him a dollar for a job well done. \xe2\x80\x93 That better?\nBert: Not really.\nSheldon: All right, well, to sum up, focus on science, keep your nose out of other people\xe2\x80\x99s business, and, uh, whoa, for a good time, call Bert.\nLeonard: What brought that on?\nSheldon: Well, last night Amy was angry with me because I\xe2\x80\x99d been foolishly telling people about certain personal matters.\nHoward: That\xe2\x80\x99s understandable.\nSheldon: Oh, I know that now. At first, I thought she was cranky because of her horrific menstrual cramps, but it turns out, no, she was genuinely mortified.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
