b'Scene: The apartment.\nLeonard: Okay, we\xe2\x80\x99re headed out, see you later.\nSheldon: Before you leave, could you test these noise-cancelling headphones?\nLeonard: Yeah, sure.\nSheldon: Okay. Go ahead.\nLeonard: Hello, can you hear me? Sheldon, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t changed the filter in the water pitcher in two years.\nPenny: Uh, Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s nickname for you is the virgin pi\xc3\xb1a colada.\nLeonard: Your George Lucas autograph is really a me autograph.\nPenny: Yeah, once I was too lazy to walk across the hall, so I used your toothbrush.\nLeonard: Ooh, and one time when you were asleep, Amy totally took off her\xe2\x80\xa6 and that\xe2\x80\x99s why you\xe2\x80\x99re the best roommate ever.\nSheldon: Aw, now I\xe2\x80\x99m sad I didn\xe2\x80\x99t hear it.\nPenny: So what do you need the headphones for?\nSheldon: Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been struggling for months to come up with a theory of dark matter that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make protons decay. I\xe2\x80\x99m hoping to finally tackle it by optimising my work environment. See, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got, uh, my tea is at the perfect sipping temperature. Uh, I have fleece-lined boxer shorts to keep my tushie toasty. And then, oh, last but not least, this inspirational cat poster improved with the reassuring face of physics renegade Richard Feynman.\nPenny: Is that why you had to take him to Office Depot last night?\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to talk about it. There, the place is all yours.\nPenny: Yeah, have fun.\nSheldon: Oh, I will, nothing more fun than a paradigm-shifting evening of science.\nPenny: And you thought it was soaping me up in the shower.\nLeonard: Bye.\nSheldon: Okay. Here we go. Proton decay. Proton decay. (Time shift) Proton decay. Proton decay. (Time shift) Proton decay. Proton decay.\nLeonard: Hey, we\xe2\x80\x99re home. Any progress?\nSheldon: How could there be, with these constant interruptions?\nPenny: I love him, but if he\xe2\x80\x99s broken, let\xe2\x80\x99s not get a new one.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: What are you doing? It\xe2\x80\x99s time to go.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to work today. And would you like to know why?\nLeonard: Ah, you\xe2\x80\x99re upset because you spent the whole night working on dark matter and didn\xe2\x80\x99t make a breakthrough, and now you\xe2\x80\x99re worried you made a huge mistake switching fields, and you\xe2\x80\x99re gonna sit around and sulk all day?\nSheldon: Like a big old baby.\nLeonard: Call me if you need anything.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99ve been cooped up in here too long. Maybe I need some fresh air.\nPenny (off): Ugh! Ugh! Ugh! Ugh!\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Penny?\nPenny (off): Ugh!\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Penny?\nPenny (off): Ugh!\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Penny?\nPenny: Ugh, what?\nSheldon: You sounded in distress. I was worried something unpleasant was happening to you. Like a murder. Or spontaneous coitus with Leonard.\nPenny: Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m just doing this awful workout. I hate it.\nSheldon: Well, if you hate it, then why are you doing it? Although I could ask the same question about coitus with Leonard.\nPenny: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, I guess I like that I hate it. It makes me work harder.\nSheldon: And to clarify?\nPenny: The exercise, Sheldon. Shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you be getting ready for work?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m not going. Would you like to know why?\nPenny: Uh, you\xe2\x80\x99re sad about not getting anything done last night, so you\xe2\x80\x99re gonna sit around and pout about it?\nSheldon: Boy, I\xe2\x80\x99m not nearly as mysterious as I think I am.\nScene: The cafeteria.\nHoward: I invented a game. You want to play?\nLeonard: Sure.\nHoward: It\xe2\x80\x99s called Emily or Cinnamon. I give you actual quotes I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard Raj say, and you guess if he was talking to his girlfriend or his dog.\nRaj: Go ahead, make fun. You can\xe2\x80\x99t embarrass me, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a beautiful girlfriend and a dog who loves me so much she drinks my bathwater.\nHoward: Okay, who was he talking to, Emily or Cinnamon? I want you to know, the bed feels so lonely when you\xe2\x80\x99re not in it.\nRaj: I may not be liking this game so much.\nLeonard: Cinnamon. Give me another one.\nHoward: Okay, Emily or Cinnamon? Check it out, I got us matching sweaters.\nLeonard: We all got the Christmas card, Cinnamon.\nRaj: You know, a man can care deeply about a woman and a pet. It\xe2\x80\x99s not strange.\nLeonard: Ooh, Emily. I heard him say that to Emily. Hey, I thought you were staying home.\nSheldon: Yeah, I was, but after talking to Penny, I realised something. I, first, she\xe2\x80\x99s trying much harder to stay attractive in this relationship than you are. And second, the reason I may not be progressing in my research is I\xe2\x80\x99ve created too pleasant of an environment for myself.\nHoward: What do you mean?\nSheldon: According to a classic psychological experiment by Yerkes and Dodson, in order to maximize performance, one must create a state of productive anxiety. So I\xe2\x80\x99d like to ask you all to do something for me. Keep me on my toes. Just throw me off my game. Essentially, go out of your way to make my life miserable.\nHoward: Hold on. What\xe2\x80\x99s in it for us?\nSheldon: Well, I suppose\xe2\x80\xa6\nHoward: Okay, we\xe2\x80\x99ll do it.\nScene: Amy\xe2\x80\x99s laboratory.\nSheldon: Done.\nAmy: 33 seconds. Okay, that\xe2\x80\x99ll be our baseline.\nSheldon: You know, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to tell you how to do your job, but when a mouse completes a maze, it gets a food pellet.\nAmy: It also gets its brain plucked out with tweezers.\nSheldon: And his last meal was a food pellet? You\xe2\x80\x99re a monster.\nAmy: All right, next, we\xe2\x80\x99re gonna introduce an anxiety-inducing stimulus, measure your stress levels and see how it affects your problem-solving rate.\nSheldon: Very well. And good luck, I\xe2\x80\x99m a pretty laid-back guy.\nAmy: Ready? Begin. Why\xe2\x80\x99d you pop it?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, I was aiming for your heart.\nAmy: Look, I know you don\xe2\x80\x99t like it, but that\xe2\x80\x99s the point of the experiment. I need to irritate you to find your optimal anxiety zone. And you said no to tickling, polka music or watching me eat a banana.\nSheldon: Who eats them horizontally?\nAmy: My mother said that\xe2\x80\x99s how good girls do it.\nSheldon: Perhaps this was a waste of time.\nAmy: Sheldon, you\xe2\x80\x99re a remarkable scientist. Just be patient, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you\xe2\x80\x99ll find the breakthrough you\xe2\x80\x99ve been looking for.\nSheldon: Thank you.\nAmy: And if you only do solid research instead of making a groundbreaking discovery, what does it matter?\nSheldon: Only do solid research? I come to you for help, and you insult me? I thought the least that you would do would be\xe2\x80\xa6\nAmy: Look, your anxiety levels are right in the zone.\nSheldon: Really? Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s fantastic. Now, wait, they\xe2\x80\x99re dropping. Why are they dropping?\nAmy: Because you\xe2\x80\x99re happy they\xe2\x80\x99re elevated.\nSheldon: Oh, that is infuriating. Ooh, look, they went back up again. Terrific. Oh, no, they went back down.\nScene: The apartment.\nRaj: All right, guys, what game do you want to play?\nHoward: Let\xe2\x80\x99s see. How about Emily or Cinnamon?\nRaj: You know what? I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a little weird that you remember me saying all these things. Maybe the truth is, you\xe2\x80\x99re jealous of all my relationships.\nHoward: Oh, maybe I am. Who wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to be the girl, or possibly dog, to hear the words you\xe2\x80\x99re so lucky, you have the shiniest hair.\nLeonard: That is a tough one. Uh, I know he brushes both of them.\nSheldon: Gentlemen, I have figured out the perfect way for you to irritate me. I\xe2\x80\x99d like you to be my intellectual sparring partners. From now on, when I make an assertion, I need you to challenge it.\nLeonard: So you just want us to disagree with whatever you say?\nSheldon: Yes.\nRaj: And you think that\xe2\x80\x99s going to help?\nSheldon: Yes.\nHoward: Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x99s gonna help at all.\nSheldon: Oh, no, it will. See, by keeping my mind engaged, I\xe2\x80\x99ll become more focused.\nLeonard: Howard\xe2\x80\x99s right, that\xe2\x80\x99ll never work.\nSheldon: Stop fighting me on the premise. It\xe2\x80\x99s scientifically valid. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to advance propositions, I just want you to challenge me.\nRaj: I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x99s what you want at all.\nSheldon: Why, of course it\xe2\x80\x99s what I want. Why would I say it\xe2\x80\x99s what I want if it\xe2\x80\x99s not what I want?\nLeonard: Because it is what you want, and it\xe2\x80\x99s not what you said.\nSheldon: I ask you for one simple thing, and you can\xe2\x80\x99t even do it.\nHoward: Yes, we can.\nSheldon: Yeah, well, then do it.\nHoward: Nah.\nSheldon: You guys are the worst. Thank you, I think that was helpful.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nPenny: So, whichever rep has the best sales for the quarter gets a trip for two to Hawaii.\nAmy: That would be so romantic for you and Leonard.\nPenny: Yeah, clearly you haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen him on the beach walking around with his metal detector.\nAmy: If I were going to Hawaii, I\xe2\x80\x99d spend all my time at the Keck Observatory. Did you know that the telescopes there have better resolution than the Hubble?\nPenny: Really? Want to go to Hawaii?\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Ladies? (Knock, knock, knock) Ladies? (Knock, knock, knock) Ladies?\nPenny: Come in.\nSheldon: Ladies.\nPenny: What\xe2\x80\x99s up?\nSheldon: Well, as you may know, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been experimenting with elevated anxiety levels, and I thought, what better way to increase my discomfort than to subject myself to an evening of tasteless uncensored crotch talk?\nPenny: What exactly do you think goes on here?\nSheldon: Well, conversations that you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be comfortable having in front of the opposite sex. You know, who has the best cervix. Which sanitary napkin is all the rage right now. Men\xe2\x80\x99s buttocks, and how you want to pat and squeeze them.\nBernadette: We were talking about Penny\xe2\x80\x99s job.\nSheldon: And how difficult it is to do when she\xe2\x80\x99s bloated, cranky and crampy? Continue.\nPenny: Sheldon, we are just people. We talk about the same things you guys talk about.\nSheldon: You talk about if werewolves can swim? See, Leonard says yes, but I say it depends on if the human could swim before he was bitten. What do you think?\nPenny: Let\xe2\x80\x99s just talk about our periods.\nAmy: No, hold on. All canines instinctively know how to swim. Why wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t a werewolf have the same abilities?\nBernadette: Well, they\xe2\x80\x99re not a hundred percent wolf. They\xe2\x80\x99re a werewolf, that\xe2\x80\x99s only part wolf. It\xe2\x80\x99s like comparing apples to oranges.\nSheldon: Thank you. Oh, and technically, it\xe2\x80\x99s apples that turn into were-oranges when the moon is full. Hey, this is fun. We should do it sometime when you aren\xe2\x80\x99t all PMS\xe2\x80\x99ing. Bye.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: What is going on?\nSheldon: Oh. Uh, I need to keep my anxiety at the right level, so I\xe2\x80\x99m using Darth Vader, the Joker, and Godzilla\xe2\x80\x99s roar to keep me in that sweet spot. Uh, I tried including Taylor Swift in the mix, but turns out I love her.\nLeonard: Well, at least listen to it through headphones. I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to sleep. Good night.\nSheldon: Boy, Taylor was right, haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate.\nScene: Amy\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nAmy: You\xe2\x80\x99ve been working so much lately, I\xe2\x80\x99m glad you didn\xe2\x80\x99t forget about date night.\nSheldon: Of course.\nAmy: Sheldon.\nSheldon: Yeah.\nAmy: Maybe you want to put the notebook away and talk to me.\nSheldon: I can do both. My brain is working at optimal capacity. I can have a conversation with you and solve the dark matter proton decay problem at the same time.\nAmy: Fine. How was your day?\nSheldon: Oh, you said it.\nAmy: Sheldon. Sheldon, I\xe2\x80\x99m worried about you. You\xe2\x80\x99re not eating, you haven\xe2\x80\x99t slept in days, and, to be honest, that cap is starting to smell.\nSheldon: I know. It\xe2\x80\x99s replaced Godzilla as my principle source of anxiety.\nScene: The apartment.\nHoward: Okay, so it\xe2\x80\x99s one vote Emily, one vote Cinnamon. Penny, you\xe2\x80\x99re the tiebreaker.\nPenny: Say the quote again.\nHoward: It\xe2\x80\x99s just so perfect that we\xe2\x80\x99re both Libras.\nPenny: Wow, this is hard. I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna say Cinnamon.\nHoward: Yes.\nPenny: Yes.\nRaj: Come on.\nHoward: That was the last one, I promise. We won\xe2\x80\x99t play any more.\nRaj: Thank you. \xe2\x80\x98Cause if she ever found out, it would hurt her feelings.\nBernadette: Emily\xe2\x80\x99s feelings?\nRaj: Yes, Emily. Whatever. Where\xe2\x80\x99s Sheldon?\nPenny: Date night.\nLeonard: That can\xe2\x80\x99t be much fun for Amy. You know, at work today, he tried his first Red Bull.\nBernadette: What happened?\nLeonard: He chased a squirrel around the quad for a while and then threw up in my car.\nBernadette: Don\xe2\x80\x99t you think you should make him stop all this?\nHoward: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, he\xe2\x80\x99s not really hurting anybody.\nLeonard: You didn\xe2\x80\x99t have to scoop vomit out of your glove compartment.\nSheldon: He is getting a lot of work done. He had a pretty interesting take on proton decay.\nRaj: Wow, if he cracks that it\xe2\x80\x99s a game changer, guys. It\xe2\x80\x99ll completely redefine our understanding of the physical universe.\nHoward: Hmm, it would. Okay, back to Emily or Cinnamon? How can such a little girl eat such a big steak?\nScene: Amy\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nAmy: Sheldon, I want you to take that cap off.\nSheldon: That nagging tone is helping my anxiety, yeah. But if you could maybe just go ten percent less shrill, that\xe2\x80\x99d really put the zip-a-dee in my doo-dah.\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, but you know we agreed not to bring work to date night.\nSheldon: There you go, perfect.\nAmy: Sheldon, stop it, I\xe2\x80\x99m not kidding. Take the cap off, and put the notebook away.\nSheldon: But after months of struggling, I\xe2\x80\x99m finally making progress.\nAmy: You don\xe2\x80\x99t need to drive yourself crazy in order to be productive.\nSheldon: Or do I, hmm? Sir Isaac Newton wrote his Principia while convinced he was an armadillo.\nAmy: That\xe2\x80\x99s not true.\nSheldon: Yeah, well, maybe it is, maybe it isn\xe2\x80\x99t. I have been hallucinating lately.\nAmy: Sheldon, this has to stop. You need to get some sleep and take care of yourself.\nSheldon: Amy, I have gotten more done in the last few days than I have since I made the switch to dark matter. What if I stop doing this, and it all goes away?\nAmy: Your thoughts and ideas come from you, not from your anxiety.\nSheldon: Hmm, perhaps. But I\xe2\x80\x99m not taking the cap off.\nAmy: It\xe2\x80\x99s one thing to make yourself miserable, but you\xe2\x80\x99re making everyone around you miserable, too. Now, I\xe2\x80\x99m telling you for the last time, take the cap off.\nSheldon: Oh, really? What if I don\xe2\x80\x99t? And before you answer that, can I have my dessert?\nScene: A bus.\nSheldon: And then she threw me out. Me, her very own boyfriend. When all I\xe2\x80\x99ve done is try to help humanity reach of the world we live in.\nMan: Yeah, well, women, what are you gonna do?\nSheldon: I knew you\xe2\x80\x99d understand, Armadillo Isaac Newton.\nScene: Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom.\nPenny: Okay.\nLeonard: Here we are.\nSheldon: Hey. What are you trying to pull? The president of science isn\xe2\x80\x99t in here.\nLeonard: You lie down, he\xe2\x80\x99ll be here in a minute.\nSheldon: Okay. Hey, I thought you were trying to trick me.\nPenny: Now, you just get comfortable.\nSheldon: No, no, comfort is the enemy. You know what\xe2\x80\x99s comfortable? Slippers and blankets and panda bears. Imagine a panda bear with Richard Feynman\xe2\x80\x99s face on it. Warm up the car, Leonard, it\xe2\x80\x99s poster time.\nLeonard: Maybe in the morning.\nPenny: Yeah, you get some sleep.\nSheldon: No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to go to sleep, you can\xe2\x80\x99t make me.\nPenny: You\xe2\x80\x99re right, we can\xe2\x80\x99t.\nSheldon: Yeah, darn straight, you can\xe2\x80\x99t. Try to tell a grown man to go to sleep.\nPenny (singing): Soft kitty, warm kitty.\nLeonard (singing): Little ball of fur.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s not gonna work.\nPenny (singing): Happy kitty, sleepy kitty.\nTogether (singing): Purr, purr, purr.\nLeonard: You know, he can be a lot of trouble, but when I see him lying here asleep like this, I just think how easy it would be to hold a pillow over his face.\nPenny: Mmmm.\nScene: The cafeteria.\nHoward: You look like you got some rest.\nSheldon: Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m feeling much better. And I\xe2\x80\x99ve also been continuing to make progress without artificially raising my anxiety levels.\nLeonard: I turned on the heat in my car and some vomit came out, so my levels, right up there.\nRaj: Hey, guys. Mind if Emily joins us for lunch?\nLeonard: Yeah, sure.\nHoward: Yeah, no problem.\nSheldon: Of course not.\nEmily: So I hear you guys have been playing a little game.\nHoward: Well, um, we were just kidding around.\nEmily: Well, you may think it\xe2\x80\x99s funny that Raj is sweet and sensitive, but I think it\xe2\x80\x99s sexy. Ugh, why is there dog hair in your mouth?\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
