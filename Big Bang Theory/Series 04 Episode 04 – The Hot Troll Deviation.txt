b'Scene: The Cheesecake Factory.\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99m telling you, if xenon emits ultraviolet light, then those dark matter discoveries must be wrong.\nSheldon: Yes, well, if we lived in a world where slow-moving xenon produced light, then you\xe2\x80\x99d be correct. Also, pigs would fly, my derriere would produce cotton candy, and The Phantom Menace would be a timeless classic.\nRaj: Oh, you\xe2\x80\x99re so arrogant. If you were a superhero, your name would be Captain Arrogant. And you know what your superpower would be? Arrogance.\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re wrong again. If my superpower were arrogance, my name would be Dr. Arroganto.\nHoward (laughs): I love watching Raj and Sheldon try to work together.\nLeonard: Yeah, it\xe2\x80\x99s like if Alien and Predator decided to go partners in a Jamba Juice.\nRaj: Has it occurred to you you\xe2\x80\x99re missing the big picture? If you look at neutron scattering data\xe2\x80\xa6\nSheldon: Oh, Penny? Penny?\nPenny: What\xe2\x80\x99s up?\nSheldon: Nothing. I just wanted to make Raj stop talking.\nHoward (after Raj whispers to him): No, no, no. He won. Suck it up.\nPenny: Well, I\xe2\x80\x99d ask you guys if you want dessert, but I know Sheldon doesn\xe2\x80\x99t eat dessert on Tuesdays. And even if Raj wanted something, he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t tell me. Howard won\xe2\x80\x99t order anything, but he will come up with some sort of skeevy comment involving the words pie or cheesecake. And Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s lactose intolerant, so he can\xe2\x80\x99t eat anything here without his intestines blowing up like a balloon animal.\nLeonard: Hang on a second. I could have the fruit platter.\nPenny: You want the fruit platter?\nLeonard: Does it have melon on it?\nPenny: Yeah.\nLeonard: No, I can\xe2\x80\x99t eat melon.\nPenny: Oh, Howard, heads up. Your ex-girlfriend just came in for her shift.\nLeonard: When was the last time you saw her?\nHoward: Oh, not since we broke up. Wow. How am I going to play this? Sophisticated and relaxed? Friendly, noncommittal? Cold and distant? (Hides under table).\nBernadette: Hi, guys.\nLeonard: Hey.\nSheldon: Hello. I see you decided to go with pathetic and frightened.\nRaj: It\xe2\x80\x99s one of his best moves.\nCredits sequence.\n  Scene: Howard\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom. Howard enters in a silk dressing gown, puts on romantic music and sets up mood lighting. Gets onto bed.\nHoward: So, my dear, we meet again.\nKatee Sackhoff: Hello, Howard. I\xe2\x80\x99ve missed you.\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99ve missed you, Katee Sackhoff.\nKatee Sackhoff: One question.\nHoward: Anything.\nKatee Sackhoff: Why am I wearing my Battlestar Galactica flight suit in bed?\nHoward: Why are you in bed with me? If we start to question this, it all falls apart.\nKatee Sackhoff: Sorry. Oh, ravish me, Howard. My loins ache for you.\nHoward: Okay, if you insist.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Howard, have you seen my girdle?!\nHoward: No, Ma!\nMrs Wolowitz: I can\xe2\x80\x99t find it, and I\xe2\x80\x99m late for my Weight Watchers meeting!\nHoward: Maybe it committed suicide! Leave me alone! Now, where were we?\nBernadette: I believe you were about to rip off my uniform with your teeth.\nHoward: Bernadette? What are you doing here?\nKatee Sackhoff: Well, if I had to guess, I\xe2\x80\x99d say I\xe2\x80\x99m here because you saw me earlier this evening, and you\xe2\x80\x99re still hung up on me.\nHoward: No, I\xe2\x80\x99m not.\nBernadette: Clearly you are. Otherwise, based on past experience, we\xe2\x80\x99d be done by now.\nHoward: Okay, I\xe2\x80\x99m a little confused here.\nGeorge Takei: Oh, my. Can I help?\nHoward: Not that kind of confused.\nBernadette: What\xe2\x80\x99s George Takei doing here?\nKatee Sackhoff: Howard, do you have latent homosexual tendencies?\nHoward: No, of course not.\nGeorge Takei: So you say. Yet, here I am.\nKatee Sackhoff: George, let me ask you something. How did you deal with being typecast as a science fiction icon?\nGeorge Takei: It\xe2\x80\x99s difficult. You try and stretch as an actor, do Strindberg, O\xe2\x80\x99Neill, but all they want is, Course laid in, Captain.\nKatee Sackhoff: Tell me about it. It\xe2\x80\x99s frackin\xe2\x80\x99 frustrating.\nHoward: Wait. Katee, why are you leaving?\nBernadette: She\xe2\x80\x99s leaving because you really want to be with me.\nMrs Wolowitz: Howard, I found my girdle! It was in the dryer!\nHoward: Great, Ma!\nMrs Wolowitz: I think it shrunk! I\xe2\x80\x99m spilling out like the Pillsbury Doughboy here!\nHoward: And with that mental picture, I think we\xe2\x80\x99re done for the evening.\nScene: The university cafeteria.\nLeonard: You know, you never told me what happened between you and Bernadette.\nHoward: I did a stupid thing.\nLeonard: Yeah, I guessed that.\nHoward: It was the kind of thing that makes it kind of hard to face her now.\nLeonard: That covers anything from farting in bed to killing a homeless guy. Oh, my God. You ran over a hobo.\nHoward: No. Stop asking.\nLeonard: All right, fine. So you want to get back together with her, but you\xe2\x80\x99re too ashamed to face her because of whatever it is you did.\nHoward: In a nutshell.\nLeonard: Okay. Well, how about this? Kidnap Bernadette from the opera wearing a creepy mask so she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know it\xe2\x80\x99s you.\nHoward: Now, you see, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if you\xe2\x80\x99re kidding or not.\nRaj: You\xe2\x80\x99re being unreasonable. Why can\xe2\x80\x99t I have a desk?\nSheldon: Our collaboration is a work of the mind. We don\xe2\x80\x99t need desks.\nRaj: You have a desk.\nSheldon: Correct.\nRaj: But I can\xe2\x80\x99t have one.\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re two for two.\nLeonard: Why can\xe2\x80\x99t he have a desk, Sheldon?\nSheldon: Oh, Lord, will this day never end? As I\xe2\x80\x99ve explained repeatedly to Dr. Koothrappali, whose ability to comprehend the American idiom fails him when it\xe2\x80\x99s convenient, there\xe2\x80\x99s absolutely no money in my budget for additional office furniture.\nRaj: Oh, but there\xe2\x80\x99s money for a drawer full of Red Vines, a marshmallow shooting rifle, and a super executive ant farm with glow-in-the-dark sand?\nSheldon: Yes.\nHoward: Okay, what if he buys his own desk?\nRaj: Yeah, what if I buy my own desk?\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s ridiculous.\nHoward: Why?\nSheldon: Because\xe2\x80\xa6\nRaj: Yes?\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s my office.\nLeonard: Sheldon.\nSheldon: All right, all right. He can buy his own desk.\nRaj: And I can put it in your office?\nSheldon: Well, you really want to dot the I\xe2\x80\x99s and cross the T\xe2\x80\x99s, don\xe2\x80\x99t you?\nLeonard: Why would you want a glow-in-the-dark ant farm?\nSheldon: They do some of their best work at night.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment. Penny is gathering laundry.\nPenny (picking up a top and sniffing it): Ah, it\xe2\x80\x99s okay.\nSheldon (voice): (Knock, knock, knock) Penny? (Knock, knock, knock) Penny? (Knock, knock, knock) Penny? (Penny opens door. Howard is stood outside with a hand-held voice recorder.) Penny?\nHoward: Would you have opened the door if you knew it was me?\nPenny: Not since I found out the teddy bear you gave me had a webcam in it.\nHoward: I just have a question. Does Bernadette ever talk about me?\nPenny: Oh, absolutely.\nHoward: She does?\nPenny: Yeah, sure. Just yesterday, she asked, why is Howard hiding under the table?\nHoward: She saw that, huh?\nPenny: Oh, no, not at first. Right after I pointed it out.\nHoward: Let me ask you something else. Is she seeing anybody?\nPenny: Uh, not that I know of. Hey, while we\xe2\x80\x99re on the subject, why did you guys break up anyway?\nHoward: Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99d rather not say.\nPenny: Howard, if you want my help, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to know what happened.\nHoward: But it\xe2\x80\x99s embarrassing.\nPenny: Yeah, that\xe2\x80\x99s what I\xe2\x80\x99m counting on. Spill.\nHoward: Okay. Well, you know World of Warcraft?\nPenny: Um, the online game? Sure.\nHoward: Well, did you know that the characters in the game can have sex with each other?\nPenny: Oh, God. I think I see where this is going.\nHoward: Her name was Glissinda the Troll. Bernadette walked in on me while we were doing the cyber-nasty under the Bridge of Souls.\nPenny: Oh, you\xe2\x80\x99re right. That is so embarrassing.\nHoward: Would you talk to her?\nPenny: Bernadette or the troll?\nHoward: Bernadette. She was so mad at me, she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t even listen to my side of the story.\nPenny: Well, what was your side?\nHoward: Well, for all we know, Glissinda the Troll wasn\xe2\x80\x99t even a real woman. I mean, she could\xe2\x80\x99ve been a 50-year-old truck driver in New Jersey.\nPenny: Really? And that didn\xe2\x80\x99t make her feel better?\nHoward: Will you talk to her, see if there\xe2\x80\x99s any chance at all we could get back together?\nPenny: Oh, gee, Howard, I really don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get in the middle of this.\nHoward: No. Why would you? I\xe2\x80\x99m just another lonely nerd, living with his mother, trying to find any scrap of happiness he can. You know, maybe to make up for the fact that his dad left him when he was 11.\nPenny: Okay, I will think about it.\nHoward: You know, I\xe2\x80\x99ve always blamed myself for him leaving. I always thought it was because I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the son he wanted.\nPenny: Yeah, I said I\xe2\x80\x99d think about it.\nHoward: I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t athletic, yeah, I was kind of sickly.\nPenny: Okay, fine. Look, look, I\xe2\x80\x99m calling her now! See?\nHoward: Thank you.\nScene: A corridor at the university.\nLeonard: So anyway, Howard asked Penny to talk to Bernadette, and she did, and Bernadette agreed to meet him for a cup of coffee.\nSheldon: One question.\nLeonard: Yeah?\nSheldon: Why on earth are you telling me all this?\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Sometimes your movements are so lifelike, I forget you\xe2\x80\x99re not a real boy.\n(Sheldon opens his office door. It bangs against a desk. Inside, Raj is sat behind a huge, ornate antique wooden desk in an enormous antique swivel chair.)\nRaj: You said I could buy a desk.\nSheldon: This isn\xe2\x80\x99t a desk. This is a Brobdingnagian monstrosity.\nRaj: Is that the American idiom for giant, big-ass desk?\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s actually British.\nRaj: Can you say it again for me?\nSheldon: Brobdingnagian.\nRaj: One more time?\nSheldon: Brobdingnagian.\nRaj: Now three times fast?\nSheldon: Brobdingnagian, Brobdingna\xe2\x80\xa6 How did you even get it in here?\nRaj: That\xe2\x80\x99s for me, Ramon, Julio, Jesus and Rodrigo to know and you to find out.\nSheldon: All right, you\xe2\x80\x99ve made your point. A fine prank, very amusing. Now get it out.\nRaj: No.\nSheldon: Yes.\nRaj: No.\nSheldon: Yes.\nRaj: No.\nSheldon: Yes.\nRaj: I have three brothers and two sisters, Sheldon, I can do this all day.\nSheldon: All right, if you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to remove it, I\xe2\x80\x99ll remove it for you.\nRaj: Knock yourself out.\nSheldon: Help me move my desk.\nRaj: No.\nSheldon: Yes.\nRaj: No.\nSheldon: Yes.\nRaj: No. It\xe2\x80\x99s too Brobdingnagian.\nSheldon: Why do you even want this here? Its size is completely disproportionate to its purpose.\nRaj: Well, seeing as its purpose was to piss you off, I\xe2\x80\x99d say it\xe2\x80\x99s spot-on.\nSheldon: All right, I see what\xe2\x80\x99s going on. This is the opening salvo in what will be an escalating series of juvenile tit-for-tat exchanges. Well titted.\nRaj: Thank you.\nSheldon: Stand by for my upcoming tat.\nRaj: Hey, Sheldon?\nSheldon: Yes?\nRaj: No. See what I did there? I turned it around.\nScene: The Cheesecake Factory\nBernadette: Sorry, I had to clock out.\nHoward: Oh, no, that\xe2\x80\x99s okay. How have you been?\nBernadette: Okay. You know, busy, school, work. You?\nHoward: Same. I took a scuba-diving course over the summer, but it turns out I\xe2\x80\x99m terrified of the ocean.\nBernadette: Too bad.\nHoward: You wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t know anybody who wants to buy a wet suit, boy\xe2\x80\x99s large? Yeah, forget it. Not important. So, are you seeing anyone?\nBernadette: Well, to be honest, I\xe2\x80\xa6\nPenny: Hey, how are we doing over here? Can I get you something to drink?\nHoward: Not for me, thanks.\nBernadette: I\xe2\x80\x99m okay.\nPenny: Are you gonna want to order food?\nHoward: Maybe later.\nPenny: Okay.\nHoward: So, are you seeing anybody?\nBernadette: No.\nPenny: That\xe2\x80\x99s what I told him when he asked me. I hope that\xe2\x80\x99s not out of line.\nBernadette: No, it\xe2\x80\x99s fine.\nHoward: Penny, can we have a little privacy?\nPenny: Oh. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.\nBernadette: What about you, have you been seeing anybody?\nHoward: Well, you know how it is with guys. I mean, we have needs and\xe2\x80\xa6\nBernadette: So you\xe2\x80\x99ve been seeing other girls?\nHoward: Well, not real girls.\nBernadette: Does that mean slutty trolls?\nPenny: You know, you look thirsty. I brought you some iced tea.\nBernadette: Thank you.\nPenny: It\xe2\x80\x99s passion fruit, new on the menu.\nBernadette: I know. I work here.\nPenny: Oh, sorry. Yeah, you\xe2\x80\x99re right. Doy. So, Howard, trolls, yay or nay?\nHoward: Isn\xe2\x80\x99t there somewhere else you can be?\nPenny: Not where I can hear you guys.\nHoward: Okay, fine. I\xe2\x80\x99ll admit, there are dark, sordid little corners of the Internet where the name Wolowizard is whispered in hushed tones. But the only reason I go there, the only reason I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever gone there is because I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a real woman in my life. You happy?\nPenny: Yeah, that\xe2\x80\x99ll hold me for a while.\nBernadette: Howard, you did have a real woman. I was right there in the next room while you were clicking that troll\xe2\x80\x99s brains out.\nHoward: Yeah, but we weren\xe2\x80\x99t, I-I mean, you and I never\xe2\x80\xa6\nBernadette: Had sex?\nHoward: Yeah.\nBernadette: Well, whose fault was that?\nPenny: Complimentary nachos! You enjoy. Never had sex? Wow.\nHoward: What do you mean, whose fault was that?\nBernadette: Well, we could\xe2\x80\x99ve been having sex, but you never made the move.\nHoward: I didn\xe2\x80\x99t think you wanted me to make the move.\nBernadette: Howard, a girl doesn\xe2\x80\x99t go out with a man like you, with your looks, your fancy patter and your tight hoochie pants if she\xe2\x80\x99s not expecting him to eventually make the move.\nHoward: Really?\nBernadette: Really.\nHoward: Son of a bitch.\nPenny: Hey, this is a little awkward, but my manager says I can\xe2\x80\x99t actually give nachos away. So, just take that when you\xe2\x80\x99re ready.\nScene: University corridor.\nHoward: Yeah, we had a really great talk, and we\xe2\x80\x99re gonna start seeing each other again.\nLeonard: Oh, congratulations. Have you broken it to the troll yet?\nHoward: Did Penny tell you about that?\nLeonard: No. Steve Patterson told me.\nHoward: The greasy old fat guy in Facilities Management?\nLeonard: Yeah.\nHoward: How\xe2\x80\x99d he know about it?\nLeonard: He\xe2\x80\x99s Glissinda the troll.\nRaj (voice): Sorry, dude, the thermostat\xe2\x80\x99s on my side of the room, so it stays Mumbai hot in here until you turn off that stupid Indian music!\nSheldon (voice): I\xe2\x80\x99ll turn off the music when you get rid of that salmonella-ridden parakeet!\nRaj (voice): Oh, too bad! Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s pathologically afraid of birds! Hey, look, Sheldon! Birdie, birdie, birdie!\nSheldon (voice): That\xe2\x80\x99s it! Prepare for marshmallow death!\nRaj (voice): Eat flaming Nerf! (Imitates gunfire)\nLeonard: So anyway, that\xe2\x80\x99s great news about you and Bernadette.\nHoward: Yeah. I think I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna take her to miniature golf.\nLeonard: Ah. Well, I guess for you guys that\xe2\x80\x99s like regular golf.\nHoward: Short jokes? Really? You\xe2\x80\x99re, like, a quarter of an inch taller than me.\nLeonard: Yeah, and don\xe2\x80\x99t you forget it.\nScene: Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s car.\nHoward: I had a good time.\nBernadette: Me, too.\nKatee Sackhoff: Kiss her good night. All right, now a little tongue.\nGeorge Takei: Hold on there. We\xe2\x80\x99ve only just rekindled the romance. Let\xe2\x80\x99s not sully the moment with the exchange of saliva.\nKatee Sackhoff: Don\xe2\x80\x99t listen to him. She wants it. Tongue. Luh-luh-luh-luh-luh. See? Now make the move.\nGeorge Takei: Mm-mmm. Too soon.\nKatee Sackhoff: Trust me, she\xe2\x80\x99s ready. Make the move.\nGeorge Takei: No, no, no. A lady wants to be wooed, courted slowly.\nKatee Sackhoff: How would you know?\nGeorge Takei: I read.\nKatee Sackhoff: Listen to me, Howard, it\xe2\x80\x99s time. Make the move, now.\nBernadette: Mm! What are you doing?\nHoward: You said, well, the move, remember?\nBernadette: Oh, not now. We\xe2\x80\x99re starting a new relationship. I need to get to know you again.\nHoward: No, you don\xe2\x80\x99t. It\xe2\x80\x99s me. The lusty charmer with the fancy patter and the hoochie pants.\nBernadette: Be patient, we\xe2\x80\x99ll get there.\nGeorge Takei: Told you.\nScene: University corridor.\nLeonard: Oh, God, what\xe2\x80\x99s that smell? (Knocks on Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s door. Sheldon answers in a gas mask). Oh-ho-hoo!\nSheldon: Yes?\nLeonard: What are you doing in there?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m making hydrogen sulphide and ammonia gas. Just a little experiment in pest control.\nRaj: It\xe2\x80\x99s not gonna work, dude, I grew up in India, an entire subcontinent where cows walk in the street, and nobody has ever had a solid bowel movement.\nSheldon: Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ll just see how long you can hold out.\nRaj: Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ll just see how your noxious gas fares against my cinnamon-apple-scented aroma therapy candles.\nLeonard: Didn\xe2\x80\x99t you say you\xe2\x80\x99re making hydrogen sulphide gas?\nSheldon: Yes.\nLeonard: Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that flammable?\nSheldon: Highly. Oh, dear. (Explosion)\nRaj: This is not over.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
