b'Scene: The stairwell.\nSheldon: What a wonderful day, thank you.\nPenny: Oh, we\xe2\x80\x99re glad you had fun.\nSheldon: Blue Icees and a trip to The Container Store? It\xe2\x80\x99s like I died and went to the post-mortem, neuron-induced hallucination commonly mistaken as heaven.\nLeonard: I still don\xe2\x80\x99t understand why you bought that pill caddie. You\xe2\x80\x99re a young man.\nSheldon: Age is a state of mind, Leonard. In here I\xe2\x80\x99m 90. Why are you taking your bins over there?\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s just where I need them. You know, she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have a lot of closet space.\nSheldon: What\xe2\x80\x99s wrong with your closet?\nPenny: Uh, well, honey, you know, now that Leonard and I are married, it kind of makes sense that we actually live together.\nSheldon: So that\xe2\x80\x99s all this day was? A plan to butter me up before delivering bad news?\nLeonard: Come on, buddy.\nSheldon: No, I thought we were friends. You asked for a sip of my Icee. If you had your own straw, I might\xe2\x80\x99ve said yes.\nPenny: Sheldon, please, we already feel bad about this.\nSheldon: You know what they don\xe2\x80\x99t sell at The Container Store? Something large enough to contain my disappointment. Although, if anyone did, it would be them.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s house.\nSheldon: Thank you for letting me come speak with you.\nBernadette: Of course.\nSheldon: As my relationships with Penny and Amy are currently strained, I\xe2\x80\x99m turning to you for female comfort and encouragement.\nBernadette: Aw. I\xe2\x80\x99m honoured.\nSheldon: I tried reaching out to my mother, but she was in Bible study. Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s mother is on a book tour. My Mee-Maw was taking a nap, and after a while Siri started repeating her answers.\nBernadette: So, I\xe2\x80\x99m your seventh choice.\nSheldon: Yeah, I know, top ten, pretty exciting.\nBernadette: How can I help you?\nSheldon: Well, in addition to Amy leaving me, Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s moving in with Penny. It\xe2\x80\x99s difficult not to feel abandoned.\nBernadette: Well, why don\xe2\x80\x99t you look at this as an opportunity? You had other roommates before Leonard. Maybe this is a chance to find someone new.\nSheldon: Perhaps I could find someone better than Leonard. Someone I can rub in his face. Chris Pratt\xe2\x80\x99s all the rage right now. I wonder how he\xe2\x80\x99d feel about taking the smaller bedroom.\nStuart: Hey.\nBernadette: Hey. You know who would be the perfect roomie?\nSheldon: Gandalf, but he\xe2\x80\x99s a smoker.\nBernadette: Stuart. He\xe2\x80\x99s been living with us for a while now. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure he\xe2\x80\x99d love to get us out of his hair.\nStuart: Nope, couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be happier.\nBernadette: Well, Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s looking for a roommate.\nStuart: Nope.\nBernadette: He\xe2\x80\x99ll think about it.\nStuart: No I won\xe2\x80\x99t.\nScene: The comic book store.\nRaj: Have you seen this Archie comic? It\xe2\x80\x99s actually Archie versus Predator.\nHoward: How could Archie defeat Predator?\nRaj: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Maybe Jughead\xe2\x80\x99s a Terminator.\nStuart: Hey.\nHoward: Hey, Stuart.\nStuart: Do you guys know any musicians?\nHoward: Why?\nStuart: I was thinking it might be cool to have live music here a few nights a week. You know, give this place more of a staying in business vibe.\nHoward: What kind of music are you thinking of?\nStuart: I like all kinds of music, but my favourite genre is free.\nRaj: Hey, we\xe2\x80\x99ve always talked about playing together.\nHoward: Well, it could be fun to try a little acoustic thing.\nRaj: Oh, we could play filk music.\nStuart: What\xe2\x80\x99s that?\nRaj: It\xe2\x80\x99s been around for years. It\xe2\x80\x99s like folk music, but with a sci-fi/fantasy theme.\nStuart: I like it. It sounds exactly like something I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be expected to pay for.\nRaj: Dude, if we do this, we\xe2\x80\x99re gonna need a cool band name.\nHoward: You know, I\xe2\x80\x99ve actually had one I\xe2\x80\x99ve been sitting on for years.\nRaj: Really?\nHoward: It was for this power trio I tried to put together in junior high, but I was short two friends.\nRaj: What is it?\nHoward: Footprints on the Moon.\nRaj: I just got chills.\nHoward: So did I.\nStuart: Me, too. But I, uh, might have Lyme Disease.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Just a few more signatures, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll be finished. Initial here to acknowledge that you\xe2\x80\x99ve returned your key. Okay. As my future neighbour, I\xe2\x80\x99d like you to have a key. Initial here to acknowledge you received it.\nPenny: I\xe2\x80\x99m proud of you. You\xe2\x80\x99re taking this really well.\nSheldon: Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s not like I\xe2\x80\x99m never going to see you two again. Which brings us to article 23 subsection C, please check here to reserve your spot at the ten year roommate reunion.\nLeonard: Do I really have to do that now?\nSheldon: No, but if you want chicken and get stuck with the fish, that\xe2\x80\x99s on you. All right. Oh, and lastly, please initial here to confirm that ownership of the living room couch is hereby transferred to me in perpetuity all throughout the universe and all alternate universes except for those universes where owning a couch is forbidden by the hive queen. In which case, all glory to the hive queen. All right, now all that\xe2\x80\x99s left is for us to sign and date the document, and we will officially no longer be roommates.\nPenny: What\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s harder than I thought.\nSheldon: Let me help you. L. E. O. N.\nLeonard: That helped.\nScene: Raj\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nRaj: So I have an idea for a filk song. It\xe2\x80\x99s kind of a, a power ballad, superhero crossover tale of epic proportions.\nHoward: Is it cold in here, \xe2\x80\x99cause, oh, my.\nRaj: Okay, so it\xe2\x80\x99s a, it\xe2\x80\x99s a David and Goliath story. It\xe2\x80\x99s about man against God. It\xe2\x80\x99s called Hammer and Whip, The Untold Story of Thor versus Indiana Jones.\nHoward: Thor versus Indiana Jones? You just blew my filking mind.\nRaj: Okay, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have it all worked out yet, but I was thinking something like, um, Oh, Indy, oh, Indy, the skies are so windy. Is that a flying man with a killer bod? Wait, that\xe2\x80\x99s no man, it\xe2\x80\x99s a Norse god.\nHoward: Oh yes, definitely. Hang on. Thunder clapped as Thor raised his mighty hammer. Indy rapped, that\xe2\x80\x99s one bad mamma-jamma.\nRaj: That is, that is so good!\nHoward: Right? Mamma-jamma just came to me.\nRaj: Okay, and here\xe2\x80\x99s the hook. Thor and Dr. Jones. Thor and Dr. Jones. One plays with lightning, the other plays with bones.\nTogether: Thor and Dr. Jones. Thor and Dr. Jones. One plays with lightning, the other plays with bones.\nHoward: Oh, man, that rocks.\nRaj: Hey, remember The Ark of the Covenant?\nHoward: Yeah?\nRaj: That\xe2\x80\x99s how much we\xe2\x80\x99re gonna melt people\xe2\x80\x99s faces off.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: I appreciate your interest in the apartment. I just need to ask you a few standard questions.\nBespectacled Man: Sure.\nSheldon: It says here you\xe2\x80\x99re a chemist. Which element on the periodic table do you feel is too big for its britches?\nBespectacled Man: Is that supposed to be a joke?\nSheldon: Looks like argon\xe2\x80\x99s not the only one with an attitude problem.\nFade to another candidate.\nSheldon: In general, would you say that you smell better, worse or the same as you do right now?\nFade to another candidate.\nSheldon: I was going to ask you what is the best fruit, but then I realized what I want to ask you is why is there a Band-Aid on your forearm, but then I realized what I really want to ask you is just can you just go?\nFade to another candidate.\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re healthy. You have a job in the sciences. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to say, if this credit report comes back good, you\xe2\x80\x99re the frontrunner.\nAmy (on Skype): I\xe2\x80\x99m not gonna be your roommate, Sheldon.\nSheldon: But I met with 11 people, and they all walked out. And that Hollywood phoney Chris Pratt never tweeted me back.\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you\xe2\x80\x99ll find somebody else.\nSheldon: I suppose. What happened to me, Amy? Years ago I was completely disengaged from my feelings. I\xe2\x80\x99d say it was a happier time, but I was disengaged from my feelings, so who can tell?\nAmy: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how to help you. You know, feelings are a part of life.\nSheldon: They didn\xe2\x80\x99t used to be. You and Leonard and Penny, you all poisoned me with emotions. I was like the Tin Man, perfectly content until that evil wizard gave him a heart.\nAmy: I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that was the point of the movie.\nSheldon: Fine, then I was like Pinocchio before that jerk Geppetto went and made him a real boy.\nAmy: There you go.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nPenny: So, what are you thinking for dinner?\nLeonard: Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s Thai food night.\nPenny: Well, honey, you don\xe2\x80\x99t live with Sheldon any more. You can have anything you want.\nLeonard: You\xe2\x80\x99re right. But what? Mexican? Italian? German? Indian? Greek? Cuban? Chinese? Pizza? Barbecue? Korean? Korean barbecue?\nPenny: How about Thai food?\nLeonard: Oh, thank God.\nPenny: Hey, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to dinner. You want to come?\nSheldon: Oh, I wish I could, but I realized I\xe2\x80\x99ve become too emotionally vulnerable, so, like an operating system, I\xe2\x80\x99m restoring my life to the last stable version, which was in 2003, the day before I met Leonard.\nLeonard: You heard him, no.\nPenny: Hang on. Wait, you actually think it\xe2\x80\x99s 2003?\nSheldon: No, just because I\xe2\x80\x99m living my life like it was 12 years ago doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean I\xe2\x80\x99m delusional. And since it is 2003, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know who you are, so please exit the premises before I call the police on my stylish new flip phone.\nScene: A Thai restaurant.\nPenny: Are you doing okay?\nLeonard: I guess. I\xe2\x80\x99m just, you know, worried about Sheldon.\nPenny: Well, come on, he\xe2\x80\x99s a grown man in his 30s pretending to be a grown man in his 20s. He\xe2\x80\x99s fine.\nLeonard: I hope so.\nPenny: What else can you do? Move back in with him?\nLeonard: No, of course not. I just feel bad.\nPenny: Well, so do I, but don\xe2\x80\x99t you want to live with your wife and set the thermostat to whatever you want and have your body tell you when it\xe2\x80\x99s time to go to the bathroom, you know, not a schedule slipped underneath your door every morning?\nLeonard: I did like that he had the weather on it.\nPenny: Trust me, this is the right thing.\nLeonard: I know. And it\xe2\x80\x99s not like we\xe2\x80\x99re abandoning him. Plus, we can FaceTime him whenever we want, you know, once iPhones are invented in his universe.\nScene: A bar.\nBernadette: I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe Sheldon asked you to be his roommate.\nAmy: I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe he ran my credit.\nBernadette: Hey, if you\xe2\x80\x99re open to living with someone great, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you a thousand dollars to take Stuart.\nAmy: You really should\xe2\x80\x99ve gone on the Internet and checked how long that kind of thing lives before you got one.\nBernadette: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. I just thought you might have a pasty, weirdo-shaped hole in your life.\nAmy: Hey, I know Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s quirky, but he\xe2\x80\x99s also brilliant and insightful. I think calling him a weirdo is a little unfair.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Hello, 2003.\nLeonard: Hey, we brought you Thai. Where is everything?\nSheldon: In my present, it\xe2\x80\x99s in the future. In your present, it\xe2\x80\x99s been crammed in the bedroom by an enterprising young man I met in The Home Depot parking lot.\nLeonard: I know what you\xe2\x80\x99re doing. You\xe2\x80\x99re trying to get attention so we\xe2\x80\x99ll feel bad for you, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not happening.\nSheldon: No, what I\xe2\x80\x99m doing is trying to figure out how to live my life now that everyone is leaving me.\nLeonard: Will you knock it off? We\xe2\x80\x99re across the hall.\nSheldon: As the kids are saying today, talk to the hand.\nPenny: They\xe2\x80\x99re not saying that.\nSheldon: They are in 2003.\nPenny: No, no, they\xe2\x80\x99re really not.\nScene: Raj\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nRaj (singing): Thor and Dr. Jones. Thor and Dr. Jones. One runs from Loki, the other runs from stones. So, what do you think?\nEmily: Wow.\nRaj: Runs from stones means that, that big boulder, but I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t rhyme anything with boulder.\nEmily: Colder, shoulder, soldier, folder.\nRaj: Right, yeah, right. But, what do you think?\nEmily: I think it\xe2\x80\x99s very cute.\nRaj: Cute? It\xe2\x80\x99s not cute. Cute is children dressed as vegetables.\nEmily: Okay, fine, it\xe2\x80\x99s not cute.\nRaj: Just be honest. You don\xe2\x80\x99t like it.\nEmily: I didn\xe2\x80\x99t say that. I, I just like music you can dance to.\nRaj: You can dance to this. Um, uh, uh, Thor and Dr. Jones. Thor and Dr. Jones. One plays with lightning, the other plays with bones.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s house.\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99m telling you, dude, the song has no groove, you can\xe2\x80\x99t dance to it.\nHoward: Who cares? I thought the whole point of Footprints on the Moon was to write songs that make people think.\nRaj: You can do both, like Michael Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s Billie Jean. While you\xe2\x80\x99re dancing you\xe2\x80\x99re thinking, like, darn it, whose baby is it?\nHoward: Where\xe2\x80\x99s this coming from? A few hours ago, we both loved this song.\nRaj: I still love it. I just think there\xe2\x80\x99s room for improvement.\nHoward: You played it for Emily, didn\xe2\x80\x99t you?\nRaj: Yeah, so what?\nHoward: You are such a wimp. She didn\xe2\x80\x99t like it, now you don\xe2\x80\x99t like it.\nRaj: No, no. I\xe2\x80\x99m just evolving as a musician. You\xe2\x80\x99re the one who\xe2\x80\x99s stuck in the past.\nHoward: The past was lunch. You know what\xe2\x80\x99s really happening here? Your girlfriend is breaking up our band.\nRaj: She has nothing to do with this. I am my own man.\nHoward: Oh, please. Your brain belongs to whoever\xe2\x80\x99s willing to sleep with you.\nRaj: That is so not true.\nHoward: Really? Remember when you were gonna get circumcised for Rachel Bernstein?\nRaj: That had nothing to do with Rachel. It was an overreaction to a bad zipper injury.\nHoward: I don\xe2\x80\x99t need this. I\xe2\x80\x99m quitting the band.\nRaj: Fine, I quit, too.\nHoward: Then get out of my house.\nRaj: With pleasure.\nHoward: Raj, wait.\nRaj: What took you so long?\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: Buddy, I know me moving in with Penny feels like a big change, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not.\nSheldon: How can you say that? Amy\xe2\x80\x99s gone, and you two are married now, so it\xe2\x80\x99s only a matter of time before you\xe2\x80\x99re gone, too.\nPenny: Okay, you don\xe2\x80\x99t know what\xe2\x80\x99s gonna happen.\nSheldon: No, I do. Eventually you\xe2\x80\x99ll want more space, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll move into a house, and then instead of dinner a couple of times a week, it\xe2\x80\x99ll only be a couple of times a month, and then it\xe2\x80\x99ll only be on special occasions, like when Bernadette divorces Wolowitz. Or, or, or like when Koothrappali\xe2\x80\x99s weird girlfriend admits where she buried his body. Or Amy\xe2\x80\x99s wedding, where she\xe2\x80\x99s marrying someone better than me.\nPenny: Okay, look, we don\xe2\x80\x99t need to rush into anything. All right? Maybe instead of Leonard moving in with me, we just leave things the way they are, and sometimes we\xe2\x80\x99ll sleep over there, and sometimes we\xe2\x80\x99ll sleep over here.\nSheldon: But mostly here.\nPenny: Sure.\nLeonard: Wuh, what about what you said in the restaurant?\nPenny: Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s not forever. It\xe2\x80\x99s just for a while. If you want, we can think of him like he\xe2\x80\x99s our dog.\nSheldon: You can. I\xe2\x80\x99m happy when you come home. And I\xe2\x80\x99m scared of fireworks. By the way, on July Fourth, we\xe2\x80\x99re all sleeping here.\nLeonard: Fine.\nSheldon: All right, great. Just give me one minute, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll get started on a new roommate agreement. Yeah. nothing from Pratt, we\xe2\x80\x99re good.\nScene: The comic book store.\nHoward (singing): Indy\xe2\x80\x99 whip snapped, Thor\xe2\x80\x99s hammer missed.\nRaj (singing): It was Avenger versus archeologist.\nHoward: Indy held his ground, and straightened his fedora.\nRaj: Thor said, that\xe2\x80\x99s a nice look in nineteen fourty-foura.\nTogether: Thor and Dr. Jones. Thor and Dr. Jones. One plays with lightning, the other plays with bones. Thor and Dr. Jones. Thor and Dr. Jones. One plays with lightning, the other plays with bones.\nStuart: Play something we can dance to.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
