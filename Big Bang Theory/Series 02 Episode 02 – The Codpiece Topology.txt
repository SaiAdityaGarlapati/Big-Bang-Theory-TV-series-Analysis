b'Scene: The building entrance lobby. The guys enter. Sheldon is dressed as a medieval monk, Howard is a court jester, Raj is a medieval gentleman and Leonard is a knight.\nSheldon: Worst Renaissance Fair ever.\nLeonard: Please let it go, Sheldon.\nSheldon: It was rife with historical inaccuracies. For example, the tavern girl serving flagons of mead, now her costume was obviously Germanic, but in 1487 the Bavarian purity laws or Rhineheitsgebot severely limited the availability of mead. At best they would have had some sort of spiced wine.\nLeonard: You\xe2\x80\x99re nitpicking.\nSheldon: Oh-ho! Really? Well here\xe2\x80\x99s another nit for you. The flagons would not have been made of polypropylene.\nHoward: Renaissance fairs aren\xe2\x80\x99t about historical accuracy. They\xe2\x80\x99re about taking chubby girls who work at Kinko\xe2\x80\x99s and lacing them up in corsets so tight their bosom jumps out and says howdy.\nSheldon: Bosoms would not have said howdy in the fifteenth century. If anything they would have said \xe2\x80\x9chuzzah!\xe2\x80\x9d\nHoward: I don\xe2\x80\x99t care what the bosoms say, Sheldon, I just want to be part of the conversation.\nPenny (arriving with a man in tow): Hi guys. Looks like you\xe2\x80\x99ve been to the Renaissance fair. I\xe2\x80\x99m hoping.\nSheldon: Renaissance fair? More of a medieval slash age of enlightenment slash any excuse to wear a codpiece fair.\nPenny: Okay, fine, whatever, um, you guys, this is my friend Eric.\nHoward: Hello.\nLeonard: Hi.\nEric: Hey.\nLeonard: So, yeah, good to see you.\nPenny: Yeah, yeah, it\xe2\x80\x99s good to see you too. We should really go.\nEric: Yeah.\nPenny(leaving): Bye guys.\nEric (leaving, to Howard): Like your hat.\nHoward: Thanks, my mom made it. Penny with a new guy, tres awkward.\nLeonard: It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t awkward. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t fun. Besides, what\xe2\x80\x99s the big deal, we dated, we stopped dating, and now we\xe2\x80\x99re both moving on.\nRaj: By moving on, do you mean, she\xe2\x80\x99s going out with other men and you spent the afternoon making fifteenth century soap with Wolowitz?\nSheldon: That was not fifteenth century soap, my God those people need to learn you can\xe2\x80\x99t just put \xe2\x80\x9cye olde\xe2\x80\x9d in front of anything and expect to get away with it.\nLeonard: Can we please just go in, my chain mail is stuck in my underwear.\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re wearing modern underwear?\nLeonard: Relatively modern. Why, what are you wearing?\nSheldon: I fashioned historically accurate undergarments out of linen.\nLeonard: You went out and bought linen?\nSheldon: Don\xe2\x80\x99t be silly, I borrowed one of your pillow cases.\nLeonard: Borrowed?\nCredits sequence\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: You know what, I\xe2\x80\x99m happy that Penny\xe2\x80\x99s moving on. It gives me the freedom to move on myself.\nHoward: Are you saying that you\xe2\x80\x99ve been holding back?\nLeonard: Of course. Out of respect.\nHoward: So, how do you explain the ten years before Penny?\nRaj: Who were you respecting then?\nLeonard: What? I\xe2\x80\x99ve dated plenty of women. There was Joyce Kim, Leslie Winkle.\nSheldon: Notify the editors of the Oxford English Dictionary, the word plenty has been redefined to mean two.\nLeonard: Uh, what about that girl last year at Comic-con?\nRaj: Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t count.\nLeonard: Why not?\nRaj: What happens in costume at Comic-con, stays at Comic-con.\nHoward: You\xe2\x80\x99re only saying that because of what happened to you.\nLeonard: What happened to you?\nRaj: N-n-n-nothing happened to me.\nHoward: It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t your fault, Raj, he was dressed as a green Orion slave girl.\nRaj: H-h-h-how did we get on me, we were mocking Leonard for not moving on. Dude, you have totally not moved on.\nLeonard: Yes I have, it\xe2\x80\x99s just a matter of actually making a date with someone.\nHoward: Like who?\nLeonard: Well, there\xe2\x80\x99s Joyce Kim, but she defected back to North Korea so it\xe2\x80\x99s a little geographically undesireable.\nRaj: What about Leslie Winkle.\nSheldon: Oh no.\nRaj: Why?\nSheldon: Her research methodology is sloppy, she\xe2\x80\x99s unjustifiably arrogant about loop quantum gravity, and to make matters worse she\xe2\x80\x99s often mean to me.\nRaj: I think she\xe2\x80\x99s smoking hot.\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99d hit that.\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99d hit particulate soil on a colloidal suspension. Mud.\nLeonard: Look, I like Leslie, but she\xe2\x80\x99s not interested in dating as much as using men as tools for stress release.\nHoward: Yeah, so, be a tool. Go get yourself a little rebound stress release.\nRaj: Technically it would only be rebound if he and Penny had actually engaged in physical intimacy.\nHoward: You mean like you and Richard the slave girl?\nRaj: I bought him dinner and we kissed once, that was it. (Leaving) And he told me his name was Kimberley!\nScene: The university cafeteria.\nSheldon: You know how I know we\xe2\x80\x99re not in The Matrix?\nLeonard: How?\nSheldon: If we were, the food would be better.\nLeslie (arriving): Hey, Leonard.\nLeonard: Hey, Leslie.\nLeslie: Hey, dummy.\nSheldon: Hello to you, insufficiently intelligent person.\nLeslie: Ooh, rush me to the burn unit. Hey, Leonard, do you have a second, I need to ask you something.\nLeonard: Uh, sure.\nSheldon: Well, if you\xe2\x80\x99ll excuse me, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to go do work that promises significant results, as opposed to what you do, which does not. Yeah, you heard me.\nLeslie: Wow. So, I heard your relationship with Penny crashed to the ground like blue ice falling out of an airplane lavatory.\nLeonard: Where did you hear that?\nLeslie: Actually I read it. Wolowitz texted me. (Shows him text.)\nLeonard: Like blue ice falling out of an airplane lavatory. Yep.\nLeslie: I thought it was a pretty good one, I gave him an L-O-L. Anyway, it got me thinking, now that you\xe2\x80\x99re unattached maybe we can revisit our previous attachment.\nLeonard: Are you suggesting another bout of stress release.\nLeslie: No, I\xe2\x80\x99m all done with casual sex. From now on I\xe2\x80\x99m fully committed to the traditional relationship paradigm.\nLeonard: Really, what changed?\nLeslie: It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to say, I guess there\xe2\x80\x99s just a time in every woman\xe2\x80\x99s life when she gets tired of waking up on a strange futon with a bunch of people she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know.\nLeonard: Yeah, I can see how that would\xe2\x80\xa6 a bunch of people?\nLeslie: Anyway, I just figure it\xe2\x80\x99s time to slow things down and who better to slow things down with than you?\nLeonard: Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m flattered. So, how do you suggest we proceed?\nLeslie: Your place, we\xe2\x80\x99ll order Chinese, you\xe2\x80\x99ll rent a movie, artsy but accessible, then light petting, no coitus.\nLeonard: Sounds fun.\nLeslie: I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave the details up to you, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s better if you assume the male role.\nLeonard: Thank you, that\xe2\x80\x99s very thoughtful.\nLeslie: Great. Call me.\nScene: The apartment. Leonard is dressed smartly and placing wine on the table. Sheldon enters.\nSheldon: Great news. My mom sent me my old Nintendo 64.\nLeonard: Terrific.\nSheldon: You know what this means, don\xe2\x80\x99t you? Break out the Red Bull, it\xe2\x80\x99s time to rock Mario old school.\nLeonard: I kind of have other plans tonight.\nSheldon: But it\xe2\x80\x99s Friday. Friday\xe2\x80\x99s always vintage game night. Look, mom included the memory card, we can pick up where I left off in 1999 when I had pernicious anaemia.\nLeonard: Well, the thing is, someone\xe2\x80\x99s coming over.\nSheldon: Well then, no problem, I have three controllers, the more the merrier.\nLeonard: Sheldon, it\xe2\x80\x99s a date, I have a date coming over.\nSheldon: Oh, well you can\xe2\x80\x99t blame me for not jumping to that conclusion.\nLeonard: Why, what\xe2\x80\x99s so unusual about me having a date?\nSheldon: Well, statistically speaking\xe2\x80\xa6\nLeonard: Alright, alright. Well, uh, nevertheless, I have one now and I would appreciate it if you would, you know, make yourself scarce.\nSheldon: Leonard, I am a published theoretical physicist with two doctorates and an IQ which can\xe2\x80\x99t be accurately measured by normal tests, how much scarcer could I be?\nLeonard: You know what I mean, could you just give us a little privacy?\nSheldon: You want me to leave the apartment?\nLeonard: Yes.\nSheldon: You mean just go someplace else and be\xe2\x80\xa6 someplace else?\nLeonard: Yes.\nSheldon: Well, why should I leave, this is my apartment too.\nLeonard: I know it is, and if science ever discovers a second member of your species and you two would like some privacy I would be more than happy to get out of your way.\nSheldon: Well alright then.\nScene: The entrance lobby. Sheldon is sitting on the bottom step using his laptop. Penny comes down the stairs.\nPenny: Sheldon? What are you doing?\nSheldon: Playing Super Mario on a poorly coded Nintendo 64 emulator.\nPenny: Yeah, but why are you doing it on the stairs?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m a modern day Napoleon exiled to the Elba of the staircase because Leonard, get this, has a date.\nPenny: Oh. Oh, well, good for him. Yeah but, why are you sitting here, why don\xe2\x80\x99t you just go to a movie or something?\nSheldon: Alone?\nPenny: Yeah, why not?\nSheldon: What if I choke on my popcorn, who will administer the Heimlich manoeuvre.\nPenny: Well then don\xe2\x80\x99t order popcorn.\nSheldon: No popcorn at the mo\xe2\x80\xa6 listen to yourself.\nPenny: Well why don\xe2\x80\x99t you go to a coffee shop.\nSheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t drink coffee.\nPenny: They have other things.\nSheldon: What do they have?\nPenny: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, you know, cookies, pastries\xe2\x80\xa6\nSheldon: Pastries such as bearclaws?\nPenny: Yeah, sure.\nSheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t like bearclaws.\nLeslie (entering): Heya Penny. Dumbass.\nSheldon: Leslie Winkle. Of all the overrated physicists in all the labs in all the world, why does it have to be Leslie Winkle?\nPenny: Well, they have a lot in common. I mean they\xe2\x80\x99re both scientists.\nSheldon: Oh please. The only way she could make a contribution to science would be if they resume sending chimps into space.\nPenny: Okay, well I have a date too, so see ya.\nSheldon: Everybody has a date. Even you, Mario, going after Princess Peach. And what am I doing, I\xe2\x80\x99m just enabling you.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeslie: This is pretty good Orange Chicken.\nLeonard: Yeah, it\xe2\x80\x99s from Changs.\nLeslie: Not Chows?\nLeonard: No, Changs.\nLeslie: What happened to Chows?\nLeonard: It changed.\nLeslie: Oh. So, how many children do you think we should have? (Leonard splutters and coughs) I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, that was a little abrupt.\nLeonard: A little.\nLeslie: I mean there are so many things to talk about before we discuss reproduction.\nLeonard: I sure hope so.\nLeslie: Besides shortness, what genetic weaknesses run in your family?\nSheldon (entering): I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry to interrupt, batteries dying continue.\nLeslie: Uh, genetic weaknesses, right, um, there\xe2\x80\x99s the lactose intolerance.\nSheldon (preparing an extension cord): Don\xe2\x80\x99t forget the male pattern baldness. When his uncles sit around the dinner table they look like a half carton of eggs. (Exits. Extension cord trails after him. Eventually goes tight a couple of times then falls loose.)\nLeonard: Okay, now my uncles are bald, but my Aunt Edna is one of the hairiest women you will ever meet. So\xe2\x80\xa6 Sweet lady. It always tickles when she hugs me. (Sheldon knocks and enters again.) What now?\nSheldon: I have to make pee-pee.\nTime shift to later.\nLeonard: Listen, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry about all of Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s interruptions, he can be a bit of an eccentric.\nLeslie: If by eccentric you mean passive-aggressive East Texas blowhole, I agree.\nLeonard: Well, I think tonight was a very good start.\nLeslie: Me too. You\xe2\x80\x99re sure you\xe2\x80\x99re okay postponing intercourse until our relationship is past the initial viability test?\nLeonard: No problem, I\xe2\x80\x99m very skilled at postponing intercourse. So I guess I\xe2\x80\x99ll call you and we\xe2\x80\x99ll arrange another evening.\nLeslie: Yes. I believe protocol dictates that you wait a minimum of 18 hours before you call so I\xe2\x80\x99m not repulsed by your cloying eagerness.\nLeonard: Sure.\nLeslie: Again, it\xe2\x80\x99s your decision, you\xe2\x80\x99re the man.\nPenny (voice off, ascending the stairs): No, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t my cat, it was an experiment designed by this guy named Schrodinger.\nEric (appearing round corner with Penny): From the Charlie Brown cartoons?\nPenny: No, he was some kind of scientist, let me start again. Oh, hey Leonard.\nLeonard: Hello.\nPenny: Leslie.\nLeslie: Hi.\n(Penny turns and crosses hall.)\nLeonard: Okay, well, goodnight. (Leans in to kiss Leslie.)\nPenny: Okay, well, goodnight. (Grabs Eric and kisses him more passionately.)\nLeslie (whispering): That ain\xe2\x80\x99t going to make your point. (Grabs him and tries to out-passion Penny. The two couples get more passionate trying to outdo each other until Leonard grabs Leslie\xe2\x80\x99s ass.) Okay, that\xe2\x80\x99s enough. (Sweetly) Call me (exits.)\nLeonard: Right (goes back inside flat. Closes door.)\nPenny (breaking off kiss): Okay, goodnight.\nEric: What?\nPenny: Had a great time, ciao (closes door.)\nScene: The university lunch room.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, I am not going back to the Renaissance Fair.\nHoward: Come on, Sheldon, there\xe2\x80\x99s so few places I can wear my jester costume.\nSheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t care. There are far too many historical anomalies for my comfort.\nRaj: Oh, okay, how about this. You can go dressed as a Star Trek science officer exploring a planet similar to Earth in the 1500s.\nSheldon: You mean like Spock?\nRaj: Sure.\nSheldon: Fascinating.\nLeslie (arriving): Hey fellow scientists. Sheldon.\nLeonard: Hey, why don\xe2\x80\x99t we all move over there so Leslie can join us.\nHoward: Hmm, let\xe2\x80\x99s do it. (Sheldon does not move. Leonard looks confused.)\nSheldon: If you\xe2\x80\x99re having trouble deciding where to sit may I suggest one potato two potato, or as I call it the Leslie Winkle experimental methodology.\nLeonard: Don\xe2\x80\x99t make this hard for me.\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s not hard. It\xe2\x80\x99s simple. You can either sit with me, your friend, colleague and roommate, or you can sit with an overrated scientist you might have sex with.\nLeonard: You\xe2\x80\x99re right, it is simple. (Sits with Leslie.)\nScene: The stairs. Sheldon is playing on his computer at the end of the long extension cord.\nPenny: Hey, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Penny.\nPenny: Third floor tonight. Mixing it up? (Sheldon indicates extension cord.) Oh. You know, I still don\xe2\x80\x99t understand why you just don\xe2\x80\x99t go to dinner or something.\nSheldon: Alright, let\xe2\x80\x99s say I go to dinner alone. And during the meal I have to use the rest room. How do I know someone\xe2\x80\x99s not touching my food?\nPenny: Goodnight Sheldon.\nSheldon: Penny, hold on. Are you sure things can\xe2\x80\x99t work out with you and Leonard?\nPenny: Excuse me?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering if you really gave it the old college try? Or in your case the old community college try?\nPenny: Okay, where is this coming from?\nSheldon: Leonard is upstairs right now with my arch enemy.\nPenny: Your arch enemy?\nSheldon: Yes, the Doctor Doom to my Mr Fantastic. The Doctor Octopus to my Spiderman. The Doctor Sivana to my Captain Marvel.\nPenny: Okay, I get it, I get it, I get it.\nSheldon: Do you know, it\xe2\x80\x99s amazing how many supervillains have advanced degrees. Graduate school should probably do a better job of screening those people out.\nPenny: Sheldon, come back, you\xe2\x80\x99re losing me.\nSheldon: Leslie Winkle, Penny. She belittles my research.\nPenny: Oh, sweetie, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.\nSheldon: She called me dumbass.\nPenny: I know. I heard.\nSheldon: Given this situation, I have no choice but to withdraw my previous objections to your ill considered relationship with Leonard.\nPenny: Oh, gee, well, thankyou for that. But, um, I think for now Leonard and I are just going to stay friends.\nSheldon: No, that response is unacceptable to me.\nPenny: Sheldon, you are a smart guy, you must know\xe2\x80\xa6\nSheldon: Smart? I\xe2\x80\x99d have to lose 60 IQ points to be classified as smart.\nPenny: Are you going to let me talk?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.\nPenny: You must know that if Leonard and Leslie want to be together, nothing you can do is going to stop it.\nSheldon: You continue to underestimate my abilities madam.\nPenny: Okay, let me put it this way, if you\xe2\x80\x99re really Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s friend you will support him no matter who he wants to be with.\nSheldon: Wait a minute, why am I doing all the giving here? If Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s really my friend, why doesn\xe2\x80\x99t he have to support me in my hatred of Leslie Winkle?\nPenny: Because love trumps hate.\nSheldon: Oh now you\xe2\x80\x99re just making stuff up.\nPenny: Okay. Goodnight Sheldon.\nSheldon: Oh Mario. If only I could control everyone the way I control you. Hop, you little plumber, hop, hop, hop.\nScene: The apartment. Leonard and Leslie are kissing.\nSheldon (entering): When the two of you reach a natural stopping point I\xe2\x80\x99d like to have a word.\nLeonard: If the word is pee-pee, just do it.\nSheldon: Leonard, you are my friend. And friends support their friends, apparently. So I am withdrawing my objection to your desire to have a relationship with Leslie.\nLeonard: Thank you.\nSheldon: I will graciously overlook the fact that she is an arrogant sub-par scientist, who actually believes loop quantum gravity better unites quantum mechanics with general relativity than does string theory. You kids have fun.\nLeslie: Hang on a second. Loop quantum gravity clearly offers more testable predictions than string theory.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m listening, amuse me.\nLeslie: Okay, well, for one thing we expect quantii space-time to manifest itself as minute differences in the speed of light for different colours.\nSheldon: Balderdash. Matter clearly consists of tiny strings.\nLeslie: Are you going to let him talk to me like that?\nLeonard: Okay, well, there is a lot of merit to both theories.\nLeslie: No there isn\xe2\x80\x99t, only loop quantum gravity calculates the entropy of black holes. (Sheldon grunts.)\nLeonard: Sheldon, don\xe2\x80\x99t make that noise, it\xe2\x80\x99s disrespectful.\nSheldon: I hope so, it was a snort of derision.\nLeslie: You agree with me, right, loop quantum gravity is the future of physics.\nLeonard: Sorry Leslie, I guess I prefer my space stringy not loopy.\nLeslie: Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m glad I found out the truth about you before this went any further.\nLeonard: Truth, what truth? We\xe2\x80\x99re talking about untested hypotheses, uh, it\xe2\x80\x99s no big deal.\nLeslie: Oh, it isn\xe2\x80\x99t, really? Tell me Leonard, how would we raise the children?\nLeonard: I guess we let them wait until they\xe2\x80\x99re old enough and let them choose their own theory.\nLeslie: We can\xe2\x80\x99t let them choose, Leonard, they\xe2\x80\x99re children. (Storms off.)\nLeonard: Wait, where are you going?\nLeslie: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, I could have accepted our kids being genetically unable to eat ice-cream or ever get a good view of a parade, but this? This is a deal breaker. (Leaves.)\nSheldon: Look on the bright side.\nLeonard: What\xe2\x80\x99s the bright side?\nSheldon: Only nine more months to comic-con.\nLeonard: Oh yeah.\nScene: The Renaissance Fair. The guys are in costume. Sheldon is Spock and has a tri-corder.\nSheldon: Captain, I\xe2\x80\x99m getting an unusual reading.\nLeonard: Yeah, that\xe2\x80\x99s great, you guys want corn dogs?\nHoward: Yeah.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s a temporal anomaly. Corn dogs didn\xe2\x80\x99t come into existence until the first half of the twentieth century.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
