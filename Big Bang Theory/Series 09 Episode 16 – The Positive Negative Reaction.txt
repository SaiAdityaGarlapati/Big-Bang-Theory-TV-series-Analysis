b'Following a \xe2\x80\x9cpreviously on\xe2\x80\x9d sequence.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s kitchen.\nHoward: Morning.\nBernadette: Morning.\nHoward: We? What is this?\nBernadette: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Maybe it says something on the back.\nHoward: Continued on milk. If you\xe2\x80\x99re tricking me into making my own breakfast, it didn\xe2\x80\x99t work for my mom, and it won\xe2\x80\x99t work for you. Are. We are. See spoons for more.\nBernadette: What could it be? We are Groot? We are the champions? We are family? I got all my sisters with me?\nHoward: Are you serious?\nBernadette: Yeah.\nHoward: Are you sure?\nBernadette: Pretty positive. That\xe2\x80\x99s a joke, because the pregnancy test says\xe2\x80\xa6\nHoward: Oh, my God. This is incredible. We\xe2\x80\x99re gonna be parents? We\xe2\x80\x99re gonna get to board planes first. Finally gonna get to see what\xe2\x80\x99s in that family bathroom at the mall.\nBernadette: I know, it\xe2\x80\x99s crazy.\nHoward: It is crazy. Oh. I mean, how do you prepare for something like this? I\xe2\x80\x99m not even sure I\xe2\x80\x99ve held a baby before.\nBernadette: Oh, it\xe2\x80\x99s okay, you\xe2\x80\x99ll figure it out.\nHoward: But how\xe2\x80\x99s this all gonna work? Do we get a nanny? I mean, can we afford a nanny? And if we can, we can\xe2\x80\x99t get a pretty one, \xe2\x80\x99cause it\xe2\x80\x99ll wreck our marriage. We can\xe2\x80\x99t get an ugly one, \xe2\x80\x99cause it\xe2\x80\x99ll scare the kid.\nBernadette: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, Howie.\nHoward: Are we in a good school district? You\xe2\x80\x99re Catholic, I\xe2\x80\x99m Jewish. What religion do we raise it? And if it\xe2\x80\x99s a boy, do we get him circumcised? People say it\xe2\x80\x99s barbaric, but if we don\xe2\x80\x99t, it looks like a pig in a blanket.\nBernadette: Calm down, it\xe2\x80\x99s gonna be okay.\nHoward: How\xe2\x80\x99s it gonna be okay? Look at me, I\xe2\x80\x99m a mess. And that means this baby\xe2\x80\x99s gonna be half a mess. And that\xe2\x80\x99s even before we screw it up with our cut-rate moderately attractive nanny.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: Hey, Raj, I read a couple of guys in your department may have discovered a new planet in our solar system?\nSheldon: Oh, I heard about that. Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you discover it?\nRaj: Because instead of being in the telescope room, I was busy making you guys home made jam for the holidays.\nSheldon: Well, you be sure to let us know when you win the Nobel Prize for boysenberry.\nLeonard: Hey.\nSheldon: Hello.\nRaj: Hey, bud.\nLeonard: Ready to play when you are.\nHoward: Yeah, um, in a minute. I actually need to tell you guys something.\nRaj: If it\xe2\x80\x99s thank you for the home made jam you got in December, congratulations, you\xe2\x80\x99re the first one.\nLeonard: What\xe2\x80\x99s going on?\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m, uh, uh, gonna be a father.\nLeonard: What? Congratulations.\nRaj: That\xe2\x80\x99s so amazing.\nSheldon: Oh, no.\nLeonard: Why oh, no?\nSheldon: Because this changes everything. What about comic book night? Uh, what about playing games together? What about our trips to Disneyland? How can we do those things with a child around?\nLeonard: Relax, there\xe2\x80\x99s room for two babies in this group.\nSheldon: Oh, dear lord, Penny\xe2\x80\x99s pregnant, too?\nLeonard: You\xe2\x80\x99re the other baby.\nSheldon: Oh, really? Okay, well, would a baby have to shave once every 11 days?\nLeonard: Would an adult refuse to eat his graham crackers because one of them was broken?\nSheldon: I guess we\xe2\x80\x99ll call this a draw.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s patio.\nBernadette: So, I\xe2\x80\x99m glad you guys are here. There\xe2\x80\x99s something I want to share with you. Howie and I are going to\xe2\x80\xa6\nPenny (reading text): Leonard says you\xe2\x80\x99re pregnant.\nAmy: What?\nPenny: Don\xe2\x80\x99t say anything. act surprised when she tells you. All right, how you want to do this?\nBernadette: I\xe2\x80\x99m pregnant.\nPenny: Oh, my God, I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe it.\nAmy: This is so exciting.\nBernadette: Yeah, it\xe2\x80\x99s all real exciting.\nPenny: Are, are you not happy about this?\nBernadette: I am. Of-of course I am. I\xe2\x80\x99m, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure it\xe2\x80\x99s just the hormones. But it\xe2\x80\x99s weird, Howie\xe2\x80\x99s the one who\xe2\x80\x99s been talking about having kids for years, and I was all excited to tell him because I thought he\xe2\x80\x99d be thrilled, but then he started to flip out and now this feels like a bad idea and I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna get fat.\nPenny: No, no, come on. Come on, you\xe2\x80\x99re not gonna get fat. You\xe2\x80\x99re gonna be beautiful and glowing and, and have the cutest little baby bump ever.\nBernadette: Easy for you to say, skinny bitch. Sorry, hormones.\nPenny: Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s all right. All I heard was skinny.\nAmy: I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t make too much out of Howard not reacting the way you expected him to.\nPenny: Yeah, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure it was just the initial shock of it all.\nBernadette: You\xe2\x80\x99re probably right. After we talked about it, he started to calm down.\nScene: The apartment.\nHoward: I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be raising a kid. I don\xe2\x80\x99t even eat my own vegetables.\nLeonard: Buddy, I, I think you might be overreacting.\nHoward: And then there\xe2\x80\x99s this nose. I mean, what if he looks like me? Or worse, what if she looks like me?\nSheldon: Not to mention the impact on our social circle. Everything\xe2\x80\x99s going to change. Howard won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to come over as much.\nRaj: Well, he could bring the baby here.\nSheldon: Oh, but then we\xe2\x80\x99d have to baby-proof the apartment. You know, my sister has one of those toilet locks in her bathroom. I have two doctorates, I still had to go in the sink.\nHoward: Oh, my God, and do you have any idea how expensive having a kid is?\nRaj: I read that in Los Angeles, raising a child through college can cost over a million dollars.\nHoward: A million dollars? God, it\xe2\x80\x99s like my nuts just kicked me in the nuts. That\xe2\x80\x99s it, I got to start earning more money right now.\nRaj: I know, you could ask Bernadette for a raise in your allowance.\nHoward: This isn\xe2\x80\x99t a joke.\nRaj: I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t joking.\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99ll be fine. People have kids every day. You\xe2\x80\x99ll figure this out.\nRaj: Yeah, come on, this is great news and you know it.\nHoward: You\xe2\x80\x99re right, it is, I\xe2\x80\x99m just a little overwhelmed right now.\nLeonard: Hey, you know what we should do?\nSheldon: All get vasectomies so this doesn\xe2\x80\x99t happen to us?\nLeonard: Go out and celebrate. But not your worst idea.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s patio.\nAmy: Hey, let\xe2\x80\x99s go do something to get your mind off this.\nPenny: Yeah, yeah, we should go out.\nBernadette: Where?\nPenny: Uh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, a bar?\nBernadette: Can\xe2\x80\x99t drink.\nPenny: We can, but all right.\nAmy: Are you hungry? How about that sushi place you love?\nBernadette: Doctor said I can\xe2\x80\x99t have sushi.\nPenny: Okay, look, we don\xe2\x80\x99t have to go anywhere. We can just, you know, stay here and hang out in the hot tub.\nBernadette: Doctor said I can\xe2\x80\x99t go in the hot tub.\nAmy: Maybe you should get a new doctor. What, he said you can\xe2\x80\x99t laugh either?\nScene: A bar.\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99d like to propose a toast to our friend, Howard, his, um, his big heart, his beautiful soul\xe2\x80\xa6\nLeonard: And his tight little pants that somehow did not make him sterile.\nAll: Cheers.\nHoward: Well, look at this. I bet whoever invented tiny umbrellas doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have to worry about money. He can have all the kids he wants.\nSheldon: And can keep a small portion of their heads dry.\nHoward: If I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna have any chance of raising this kid, I need to come up with a big idea to make some money.\nLeonard: There\xe2\x80\x99s no reason you can\xe2\x80\x99t.\nHoward: That\xe2\x80\x99s easy for you to say. You and Sheldon already came up with your superfluid helium model.\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99s just research. We\xe2\x80\x99re never gonna make any money from it.\nSheldon: Forget helium. The real superfluid is the fruit punch in this mug. Reminds me of my daddy\xe2\x80\x99s secret don\xe2\x80\x99t tell mama juice.\nLeonard: Uh, these are strong, you should slow down.\nSheldon: Oh. I\xe2\x80\x99ll just take one last sip. Ah.\nScene: The same, later.\nHoward: Okay, how about this for an invention, slightly bigger cocktail umbrellas.\nLeonard: How is that a new invention?\nHoward: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, all Apple does is change the size of things and we keep buying them.\nRaj: It\xe2\x80\x99s true. I like my giant iPad and my little iPad almost as much as my regular-sized iPad.\nSheldon: This place is terrific. Why. why have we never been here before?\nLeonard: The same reason we don\xe2\x80\x99t do a lot of fun stuff. You.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s some smart talk from a guy who can\xe2\x80\x99t even keep his face in focus. Where\xe2\x80\x99s the bathroom?\nRaj: Uh, it\xe2\x80\x99s in the corner.\nSheldon: Excuse me. Hey, how you doin\xe2\x80\x99?\nRaj: I hope the bathroom is clearly marked.\nLeonard: Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter. He\xe2\x80\x99s headed for the kitchen anyway.\nHoward: Maybe that\xe2\x80\x99s an idea, guidance systems for drunk people.\nRaj: They have that. It\xe2\x80\x99s called Uber.\nHoward: Hey. In your supercooled helium experiments, did you create quantum vortices?\nLeonard: Yeah. Why?\nHoward: Well, if you made a guidance system, couldn\xe2\x80\x99t you use those vortices as a gyroscope?\nLeonard: Wow. I\xe2\x80\x99ve never thought about that.\nHoward: And since it\xe2\x80\x99s in a quantum state, it would maintain an infinite persistence.\nRaj: Groundbreaking revelations, tropical drinks. Tell me this isn\xe2\x80\x99t like the best episode of Sex and the City.\nLeonard: You may have actually just come up with something.\nHoward: You think so?\nLeonard: I really do.\nSheldon: You guys, the bathroom here is amazing. There\xe2\x80\x99s people cooking in it.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s patio.\nAmy: Think about all the fun things you get to do when you have a baby.\nPenny: Yeah, yeah, you get to buy toys and little clothes.\nBernadette: I kind of already do that for Howie.\nPenny: And whenever you\xe2\x80\x99re hungry, you\xe2\x80\x99ll be in a minivan with Cheerios all over the floor.\nAmy: Oh, and I just found a new travel cup for Sheldon. It only lets out three at a time. So, when did you guys decide to get pregnant?\nBernadette: Well, we didn\xe2\x80\x99t exactly decide. We were talking about it, and then one night we got a little reckless.\nPenny: Oh, tell us.\nAmy: Yeah, tell us.\nBernadette: No, I\xe2\x80\x99m embarrassed.\nPenny: Oh, come on, we\xe2\x80\x99re all grown-ups. We\xe2\x80\x99ve all done it.\nAmy: Me, me, me too. I\xe2\x80\x99m a grown-up and I\xe2\x80\x99ve done it.\nBernadette: Fine. We were out one night, and things got a little spontaneous.\nAmy: Oh, that sounds juicy.\nBernadette: Well, Sheldon was going on and on about time zones and railroad schedules, and I went out\xe2\x80\xa6\nPenny: Wait, I remember that. Hang on. You did it at our place?\nBernadette: Kind of on Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s bed.\nAmy: What?\nPenny: No.\nBernadette: I was headed to the bathroom, and I passed Howie on his way out. Usually he says, do not go in there, but this time he said, hey, let\xe2\x80\x99s go in here.\nAmy: How could you do that?\nBernadette: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, but you know what it\xe2\x80\x99s like when you\xe2\x80\x99re with your man and one thing leads to another.\nAmy: I do know what that\xe2\x80\x99s like. I really do.\nScene: The bar.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m not seeing anyone using liquid helium vortices like this.\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m not finding anything either.\nRaj: It\xe2\x80\x99s a good sign.\nSheldon: Oh, wait, I found something.\nHoward: Damn. What is it?\nSheldon: This video. The baby panda sneezes, and the mama panda gets so scared.\nLeonard: Can you focus on what we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about?\nSheldon: All right. Look, now, this may be the rum talking, but as long as the unpinning rate of the vortices is kept within 1.1 and 1.3, the Magnus force issue should be negligible.\nRaj: Even drunk, he\xe2\x80\x99s still smarter than all of us.\nSheldon: And stronger. Who wants to see me beat up the bartender?\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99d enjoy that.\nSheldon: Nah, she\xe2\x80\x99s a good kid.\nHoward: If this is a viable thing, we could get a patent and license it to companies that make guidance systems.\nRaj: Look at that. You\xe2\x80\x99ve known you\xe2\x80\x99re gonna be a father for less than a day and you\xe2\x80\x99re already stepping up.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m telling you, you got this.\nHoward: Maybe you\xe2\x80\x99re right.\nSheldon: Of course he\xe2\x80\x99s right. You and I both know how hard it is growing up without a father. That\xe2\x80\x99s why I\xe2\x80\x99m confident you\xe2\x80\x99re gonna be the best dad you can be.\nHoward: Thank you, Sheldon.\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re welcome. And if he has twins, we can do all kinds of neat experiments on them.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s hot tub.\nBernadette: You guys can go in if you want.\nPenny: No, we\xe2\x80\x99re a team. If you can\xe2\x80\x99t go in, we\xe2\x80\x99re not going in.\nAmy: Then why are we drinking?\nPenny: Okay, it\xe2\x80\x99s not like she\xe2\x80\x99s got the Christ child in there, all right? (Checking text) Oh. It\xe2\x80\x99s Leonard. He says Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s drunk and they\xe2\x80\x99re gonna do karaoke if we want to join them.\nBernadette: That sounds fun.\nAmy: Oh, no. Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s drunk texting me.\nPenny: What\xe2\x80\x99s it say?\nAmy: Would you like to sing karaoke with us.\nBernadette: How is that a drunk text?\nAmy: He used a period instead of a question mark. He\xe2\x80\x99s so wasted.\nScene: The bar.\nRaj (rapping): Your movie\xe2\x80\x99s showing, so you\xe2\x80\x99re going. Could care less about the five you\xe2\x80\x99re blowing. Theatre gets dark just to start the show. You spot a fine woman sitting in your row, she\xe2\x80\x99s dressed in yellow, she says hello, come sit next to me, you fine fellow. You run over there without a second to lose, and what comes next, hey, bust a move.\nLeonard (singing): You want it, you got it, oh, you want it, baby you got it\nRaj: Just bust a move,\nLeonard: You want it, you got it, oh, you want it, baby you got it\nRaj: Just bust a move,\nLeonard: You want it, you got it, oh, you want it, baby you got it\nPenny: Hey, guys. Congratulations.\nHoward: Thank you.\nAmy: Hi. How are you doing?\nSheldon: Wonderful. I\xe2\x80\x99m being musically encouraged to bust a move. If I knew what that meant, I might just do it.\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m really glad you\xe2\x80\x99re here. Can we talk?\nBernadette: Sure.\nPenny: So, you gonna get up there later?\nSheldon: A microphone, a room full of inaccurate depictions of Polynesian religion, and a captive audience to hear about it? You bet I am.\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry I freaked out this morning. I want you to know I\xe2\x80\x99m done being scared.\nBernadette: It\xe2\x80\x99s okay to be nervous. I am, too.\nHoward: Thank God, \xe2\x80\x99cause I was lying, you might not have to wait nine months to see someone soil their pants. But I\xe2\x80\x99m also really excited. I mean it.\nBernadette: Me, too.\nHoward: I love you. Mmm. And I\xe2\x80\x99m not just saying that because your breasts are gonna get bigger.\nScene: The same, later.\nPenny (singing): Are we an item? Girl, quit playin\xe2\x80\x99.\nAmy (singing): We\xe2\x80\x99re just friends, what are you sayin\xe2\x80\x99?\nPenny (singing): Say there\xe2\x80\x99s another and look right in my eyes.\nAmy (singing): My first love broke my heart for the first time.\nTogether: And I was like, baby, baby, baby, ooh, like, baby, baby, baby, no, like, baby, baby, baby, ooh, I thought you\xe2\x80\x99d always be mine.\nScene: The same, later.\nHoward (singing): Baby, I need your lovin\xe2\x80\x99, got to have all your lovin\xe2\x80\x99. Baby, I need your lovin\xe2\x80\x99, got to have all your lovin\xe2\x80\x99.\nScene: The same, later.\nRaj (singing): Ooh, baby, baby, baby, baby. Ooh, baby, baby, baby, baby.\nLeonard (singing): Ah, push it.\nBernadette: I appreciate this, but you really\xe2\x80\xa6\nLeonard (singing): Push it real good.\nScene: The same, later.\nSheldon (singing): Land where my fathers died, land of the pilgrims\xe2\x80\x99 pride, from every mountainside let freedom ring.\nScene: The same, later.\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99d like to dedicate my last song of the evening to my wife, best friend, and now the mother of our child. I love you, Bernie. (Singing) Havin\xe2\x80\x99 my baby, what a lovely way of sayin\xe2\x80\x99 how much you love me. Havin\xe2\x80\x99 my baby, what a lovely way of sayin\xe2\x80\x99 what you\xe2\x80\x99re thinkin\xe2\x80\x99 of me.\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re kidding. What kind of maniacs have coitus in someone else\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom?\nHoward: Thank you, Pasadena. Good night.\nScene: The apartment.\nPenny: That was such a fun night.\nLeonard: Probably \xe2\x80\x99cause you got to see your man up there rockin\xe2\x80\x99 the mic.\nPenny: Yeah, yeah. I was a little surprised when you decided to beat-box.\nLeonard: Oh. That was really an asthma attack. I just sold it.\nPenny: Well, I am so happy for Howard and Bernadette.\nLeonard: Me, too. So, you ever think about it?\nPenny: Babies? Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a rush but someday, yeah, sure. What about you?\nLeonard: I think we\xe2\x80\x99d make amazing parents.\nSheldon: Will you guys keep it down?\nPenny: On the other hand, we might lack a certain maturity.\nAdvertisements'
