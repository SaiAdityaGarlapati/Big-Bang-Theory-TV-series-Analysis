b'Scene: The apartment. A robotic arm is extracting some Chinese takeaway from a bag controlled by Howard.\n  Howard: And now the kung pao chicken.\nLeonard: Alright.\nRaj: Smooth.\nHoward: And finally, my moo shu pork.\nRaj: Whoo-hoo!\nHoward: Ah, there you have it, gentlemen. Our entire dinner unpacked by robot.\nRaj: And it only took 28 minutes.\nSheldon: Impressive, but we must be cautious.\nHoward: Why?\nSheldon: Today, it\xe2\x80\x99s a Chinese food retrieval robot. Tomorrow, it travels back in time and tries to kill Sarah Connor.\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x99s going to happen, Sheldon.\nSheldon: No one ever does. That\xe2\x80\x99s why it happens.\nPenny (arriving): Hey. Is the food here? Ooh. What\xe2\x80\x99s that?\nHoward: That, dear lady, is the Wolowitz Programmable Hand, designed for extravehicular repairs on the International Space Station.\nPenny: Ah, cool.\nHoward: Ask me to pass the soy sauce.\nPenny: Oh, does that come up much on the space station?\nHoward: Mostly with Asian and Jewish astronauts.\nPenny: All right. Pass the soy sauce.\nHoward: Coming up. (Starts typing rapidly)\nLeonard: So how\xe2\x80\x99s work?\nPenny: Oh, it\xe2\x80\x99s not bad. Kind of hungry.\nLeonard: Yeah, we all are.\nHoward: Just wait.\nSheldon: You realize, Penny, that the technology that went into this arm will one day make unskilled food servers such as yourself obsolete.\nPenny: Really? They\xe2\x80\x99re going to make a robot that spits on your hamburger?\nSheldon: I thought you broke up with her. Why is she here?\nHoward: Okay, here we go. Passing the soy sauce. Put out your hand.\nPenny: Oh ha-ha, oh. That\xe2\x80\x99s amazing.\nSheldon: I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say amazing. At best, it\xe2\x80\x99s a modest leap forward from the basic technology that gave us Country Bear Jamboree.\nHoward: Hey, Sheldon?\nSheldon: Yes? (Howard types. The hand puts up two fingers to Sheldon.) Peace?\nHoward: No, not peace. Hang on.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: A few moments later.\nPenny: Does NASA know you\xe2\x80\x99re using that thing as a napkin holder?\nHoward: You kidding? They still think it\xe2\x80\x99s in a secure locker at JPL.\nPenny: You stole it?\nHoward: Borrowed. The trick is to carry it out to your car like you own it.\nSheldon (phone gives text alert): Excuse me. Oh. Amy\xe2\x80\x99s at the dry cleaners, and she\xe2\x80\x99s made a very amusing pun. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t care for perchloroethylene, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t like glycol ether.\xe2\x80\x9d Get it? She doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like glycol ether. Sounds like either. (Taps in reply) L-O-L.\nPenny: Who\xe2\x80\x99s Amy?\nLeonard: His girlfriend.\nPenny: Sheldon has a girlfriend?\nSheldon: She\xe2\x80\x99s not my girlfriend.\nPenny: How long has this been going on?\nLeonard: Four months.\nSheldon: She\xe2\x80\x99s not my girlfriend.\nPenny: Are you telling me, for the past four months I have been asking you what\xe2\x80\x99s new and you never thought to go with Sheldon has a girlfriend?\nSheldon: She\xe2\x80\x99s not my girlfriend.\nPenny: Ah, du-du-du-du-du. How did they meet?\nHoward: Raj and I entered Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s information on a dating site, and it spit out Amy Farrah Fowler.\nPenny: Oh, my God! Sheldon and Amy.\nHoward: Or, as we call them, Shamy.\nPenny (squeals): Shamy. I am so digging the Shamy.\nSheldon: All right, everyone pay attention. Yes, I have a friend named Amy Farrah Fowler. Yes, she is female. Yes, we communicate on a daily basis, but no, she is not my girlfriend.\nPenny: Okay, well, what do you communicate about?\nSheldon: Well, my work in physics, her work in neurobiology, and most recently, the possibility of our having a child together.\nPenny (spits out drink explosively. Howard types. Robot arm hands Penny a napkin): Thank you.\nLeonard: Wait a minute\xe2\x80\x93 a child? You never see this girl. You just e-mail and text and Twitter. Now you\xe2\x80\x99re considering having a baby?\nSheldon: Amy pointed out that between the two of us, our genetic material has the potential of producing the first in a line of intellectually superior, benign overlords to guide humanity to a brighter tomorrow.\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m guessing that future historians will condemn us for not taking this opportunity to kill Sheldon.\nPenny: Okay, I have a question.\nSheldon: Yes, Penny.\nPenny: You don\xe2\x80\x99t even like people touching you. How are you going to have sex?\nSheldon: Why on Earth would we have sex?\nPenny: Oh, honey, did your mom not have the talk with you? You know, when your private parts started growing?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m quite aware of the way humans usually reproduce, which is messy, unsanitary, and based on living next to you for three years, involves loud and unnecessary appeals to a deity.\nPenny: Oh, God.\nSheldon: Yes, exactly. Consequently, if Amy and I choose to bring new life into this world, it will be accomplished clinically, with fertility experts in a lab with petri dishes. Which reminds me, you have broad hips and a certain corn-fed vigour. Is your womb available for rental?\nLeonard: Still digging the Shamy?\nPenny: Look, Sheldon, before you race off to the fertility clinic, you might want to think about, uh gee, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, maybe actually spending some time with her.\nSheldon: You mean dating?\nPenny: Yeah.\nSheldon: I can\xe2\x80\x99t date Amy.\nPenny: Why not?\nSheldon: She\xe2\x80\x99s not my girlfriend.\nPenny: Okay, look, don\xe2\x80\x99t think of it as dating a girlfriend. Think of it as, uh, getting to know the future mother of your child.\nSheldon: Oh. I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t considered that. I suppose she will have to have access to our progeny. And you don\xe2\x80\x99t think I can achieve the required intimacy via text messaging?\nPenny: Probably not.\nSheldon: Huh. It would appear as if the phone companies have been lying to me.\nScene: The hallway.\n  Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny.\nPenny: You do realize I stand on the other side of the door waiting for you to finish knocking three times.\nSheldon: I know. I can see the shadow of your feet under the door.\nPenny: Yeah, my point is it\xe2\x80\x99s a waste of time.\nSheldon: If you\xe2\x80\x99re looking for an example of a waste of time, I would refer you to the conversation we\xe2\x80\x99re having right now.\nPenny: What do you want?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99ve decided to take your advice and have arranged to go on a date with Amy Farrah Fowler.\nPenny: Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s great. Have fun.\nSheldon: Wait. You have to drive me.\nPenny: What?\nSheldon: You know I don\xe2\x80\x99t drive.\nPenny: Well, go ask Leonard.\nSheldon: I did. He said, and I quote, ask Penny, it was her cockamamie idea.\nPenny: Leonard said cockamamie?\nSheldon: Actually, I\xe2\x80\x99m paraphrasing. Having been raised in a Christian household, I\xe2\x80\x99m uncomfortable with the language he used. And to be honest, I\xe2\x80\x99m not entirely comfortable with cockamamie.\nPenny: Okay, fine. When\xe2\x80\x99s the date?\nSheldon: Now.\nPenny: Now?\nSheldon: Hurry. We\xe2\x80\x99re going to be late.\nPenny: Sheldon, did it ever occur to you that I might have other plans?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. Do you have other plans?\nPenny: Well, no, not per se, but\xe2\x80\xa6\nSheldon: So this conversation is as pointless as your door-knocking soliloquy?\nPenny: Let me get my cockamamie keys.\nScene: Howard\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom. Howard is being massaged by the robot hand.\nHoward: Oh, God, that feels so good. Yeah, that\xe2\x80\x99s the spot. Oh, baby.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Howard, dinner\xe2\x80\x99s ready!\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99ll eat later. I\xe2\x80\x99m busy! Oh, yeah. Just like a real hand. Hmm.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s car.\nSheldon: Thank you for driving me.\nPenny: You\xe2\x80\x99re welcome.\nSheldon: I wish you weren\xe2\x80\x99t wearing flip-flops. It\xe2\x80\x99s dangerous to drive in flip-flops.\nPenny: Sheldon.\nSheldon: Sorry. I just don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be yet another flip-flop fatality.\nPenny: Can I ask you a question?\nSheldon: Given your community college education, I encourage you to ask me as many as possible.\nPenny: Yeah. Well, my question is, and I\xe2\x80\x99m pretty sure I know the answer, is this your first date?\nSheldon: That depends. Does square-dancing with my sister at a Teens for Jesus Fourth of July Hoedown count as a date?\nPenny: No.\nSheldon: Then, this is my first date.\nPenny: Okay. Well, then, there\xe2\x80\x99s a couple of things you should probably know.\nSheldon: I have a master\xe2\x80\x99s degree and two doctorates. The things I should know, I do know.\nPenny: My point is, I know more about dating than you, and if you were as smart as you think you are, you would listen to me.\nSheldon: If you know so much, how come I have a date tonight and you have nothing better to do than drive me to it?\nPenny: Fair point.\nScene: The apartment.\nRaj: You know, there\xe2\x80\x99s something I\xe2\x80\x99ve always wondered about Aquaman.\nLeonard: Yeah?\nRaj: Where does he poop?\nLeonard: What?\nRaj: What would a toilet look like in Atlantis? How would you flush it? And when you did flush it, where would the poop go?\nLeonard (phone rings): Hold that thought. Hey, Howard, what\xe2\x80\x99s going on? What? Hold on, Howard, Howard, slow down. The robot hand is stuck on your what? (To Raj) You\xe2\x80\x99re not going to believe this.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s car. Amy is now in the back seat.\nPenny: So, um, Amy, Sheldon tells me you\xe2\x80\x99re a neuro something-or-other.\nAmy: Neurobiologist. Your check engine light is on.\nPenny: Yeah, it\xe2\x80\x99s okay.\nAmy: But the light indicates\xe2\x80\xa6\nSheldon: Don\xe2\x80\x99t bother. I\xe2\x80\x99ve wasted many an hour tilting at that particular windmill.\nPenny: Um, what is that scent you\xe2\x80\x99re wearing? It smells great.\nAmy: Dandruff shampoo. I have dry scalp.\nPenny: Ah. Well, your hair looks very nice.\nAmy: Are you a homosexual?\nPenny: No, no, I was just giving you a compliment.\nAmy: Hmm. Would have been more flattered if you were a homosexual.\nPenny: Guys, how \xe2\x80\x99bout some music?\nSheldon: Oh, no, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t care for that. Amy?\nAmy: No, thank you.\nPenny: Okay. Uncomfortable silence it is. Hey, Sheldon, have you told Amy what it was like for you growing up in Texas?\nSheldon: No.\nPenny: Well, why don\xe2\x80\x99t you tell her?\nSheldon: All right. It was hell.\nPenny: Any follow up, Amy?\nAmy: No.\nPenny: I myself grew up in Nebraska. Small town outside of Omaha. You know, nice place, mostly family farms, a few meth labs.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, how is this better than uncomfortable silence?\nPenny: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I was just trying something.\nSheldon: Muggles.\nScene: Howard\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom.\nRaj: You slipped and fell into a robot hand?\nHoward: Yes.\nRaj: Penis first?\nHoward: Yes. Now, help me!\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99d suggest a lubricant, but I have a feeling you fell on some of that as well.\nHoward: Not funny, Leonard.\nRaj: Really? A robot hand\xe2\x80\x99s got a death grip on your junk, dude. That\xe2\x80\x99s funny, ask anyone.\nHoward: Please, before my mother walks in, just get this off me!\nLeonard: Okay, let\xe2\x80\x99s see.\nHoward: No, no! Don\xe2\x80\x99t touch, the program is paused.\nLeonard: Well, then let\xe2\x80\x99s un-pause it.\nHoward: No, no! I loaded the wrong program. The hand thinks it\xe2\x80\x99s holding a screwdriver in outer space. If you continue the program, it\xe2\x80\x99s gonna start twisting.\nRaj: A-All right, um, how about this. When, when Winnie the Pooh got his head stuck in the honey tree, his friends all grabbed onto him and pulled and pulled.\nLeonard: You do what you want, I\xe2\x80\x99m not touching another man\xe2\x80\x99s honey tree.\nRaj: All right, uh, forget pulling. How about we get an electric saw and cut it off?\nHoward: What? No saws! One circumcision was enough.\nLeonard: How about an acetylene torch?\nHoward: Okay, I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe this needs to be said out loud. No pulling, no saws, no torches.\nLeonard: Well, then what do you want us to do?\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\xa6\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Howard, I made cookies for you and your little friends!\nHoward: That\xe2\x80\x99s great, Mom, thanks!\nMrs Wolowitz (off): I\xe2\x80\x99ll bring them up with some Hawaiian Punch!\nHoward: Don\xe2\x80\x99t come up here!\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Why not?! Are you ashamed of your mother?!\nHoward: Yes, but that\xe2\x80\x99s not the point! Get me out of here.\nLeonard: You have any ideas, Raj?\nRaj: Right now, all I can think about is cookies and Hawaiian Punch.\nScene: A restaurant.\nPenny: Hey, here\xe2\x80\x99s another possible topic of conversation. This is a big night for Sheldon. Right, Sheldon?\nSheldon: Big night? The winter solstice is a big night. It\xe2\x80\x99s over 14 hours in Southern California.\nAmy: That\xe2\x80\x99s an amusing factoid.\nSheldon: Thank you.\nPenny: No, no. My point is, uh, tonight is Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s first official date. Discuss.\nAmy: Is this true?\nSheldon: Apparently, a semi-incestuous Teens for Jesus Fourth of July Hoedown didn\xe2\x80\x99t count.\nPenny: So, um, Amy, what about you? Do you date much?\nAmy: Once a year. It\xe2\x80\x99s a deal I made with my mother in exchange for her silence on the matter, as well as the occasional use of her George Foreman Grill that seals in the flavour without the fat. How about you, Penny? Do you go on many dates?\nPenny: Uh, yeah, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say many. A few. (Sheldon laugh\xe2\x80\x99s strangely). What\xe2\x80\x99s (imitates Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s laugh)\n  Sheldon: Your characterization of approximately 171 different men as a few.\nPenny: What? Where did you get 171 men?\nSheldon: Simple extrapolation. In the three years that I\xe2\x80\x99ve known you, you were single for two. During that time, I saw 17 different suitors. If we work backwards, correcting for observation bias and postulate an initial dating age of 15\xe2\x80\xa6\nPenny: Whoa, wait, wait, wait. I did not start dating at 15.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. 16?\nPenny: 14.\nSheldon: My mistake. Now, assuming the left side of a bell curve peaking around the present, that would bring the total up to 193 men. Plus or minus eight men.\nAmy: Remarkable. Did you have sexual intercourse with all of these men?\nPenny: No.\nSheldon: Although that number would be fairly easy to calculate.\nPenny: Oh.\nSheldon: Based on the number of awkward encounters I\xe2\x80\x99ve had with strange men leaving her apartment in the morning, plus the number of times she\xe2\x80\x99s returned home wearing the same clothes she wore the night before\xe2\x80\xa6\nPenny: Okay, Sheldon, I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve made your point.\nSheldon: So we multiply 193, minus 21 men before the loss of virginity, so 172 times 0.18 gives us 30.96 sexual partners. Let\xe2\x80\x99s round that up to 31.\nPenny: Okay, Sheldon, you are so wrong. That is not even close to the real number. I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna need a drink over here.\nAmy: This is very interesting. Cultural perceptions are subjective. Penny, to your mind, are you a slut?\nPenny: No! No! No. Let\xe2\x80\x99s just all finish our dinners, okay?\nSheldon: This is an interesting topic. How many sexual encounters have you had?\nAmy: Does volunteering for a scientific experiment in which orgasm was achieved by electronically stimulating the pleasure centres of the brain count?\nSheldon: I should think so.\nAmy: Then 128.\nScene: A hospital,=.\nLeonard: Okay, come on. Almost there.\nHoward: Don\xe2\x80\x99t tug. No tugging.\nRaj: Next time, take your own advice.\nLeonard: Excuse me, could you help us out?\nNurse: My, my, my. What do we have here?\nHoward: I slipped and fell.\nNurse: Yeah, we get that a lot. What is this?\nHoward: It\xe2\x80\x99s a robot arm.\nNurse: Where\xe2\x80\x99s the rest of the robot?\nHoward: I only built the arm.\nNurse: \xe2\x80\x98Cause that\xe2\x80\x99s all you needed, right?\nHoward: Can you please just help me?\nNurse: All right, all right. Hang on, stay calm. (Over PA system) I need an orderly with a wheelchair. I got a robot hand grasping a man\xe2\x80\x99s penis out here.\nHoward: You think you could be a little more discreet?\nNurse: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, we don\xe2\x80\x99t have a code for robot hand grasping a man\xe2\x80\x99s penis. Why is it hooked up to a computer?\nLeonard: Uh, it\xe2\x80\x99s what controls the arm.\nHoward: But it\xe2\x80\x99s frozen.\nNurse: Did you try turning it off and back on again?\nHoward: No, you see, it\xe2\x80\x99s more complicated than that. (Nurse switches off computer) No, wait! (The hand lets go) Winnie the Pooh is out of the honey tree.\nRaj: Now can we have cookies and Hawaiian Punch?\nScene: The stairwell.\nSheldon: You were right. This was a very productive evening. I saw a whole new side of Amy Farrah Fowler tonight.\nPenny: I did not have sex with 31 guys.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99ll be happy to check the math, but numbers don\xe2\x80\x99t lie, Penny. In any event, now that Amy and I have spent quality time together, I feel much more confident proceeding to the next stage of our relationship.\nPenny: And that is?\nSheldon: Using in vitro fertilization and a surrogate uterus to gift humanity with our progeny.\nPenny: You\xe2\x80\x99re still on that?\nSheldon: In these uncertain times, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t humanity deserve a gift?\nPenny: Okay, you know what? I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna come at this in a whole new way. Sheldon, if you try to make a baby with Amy in a petri dish, I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna tell your mother on you.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s no threat. My mother\xe2\x80\x99s always wanted a grandchild.\nPenny: Really? Your deeply religious born-again Christian mother wants a test-tube grandbaby born out of wedlock?\nSheldon: Curses.\nPenny: If I\xe2\x80\x99d thought of that in the first place, I could\xe2\x80\x99ve saved myself this whole night.\nSheldon: Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s not that late. You could still go out and look for number 32. Good night.\nLeonard (on phone): Hey, Howard, what\xe2\x80\x99s up?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99ve decided not to procreate.\nLeonard: Yeah, yeah, great. Howard, uh, slow down. What do you mean it happened again?\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
