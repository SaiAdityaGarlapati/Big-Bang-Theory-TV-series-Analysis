b'Scene: The apartment.\nAmy: This is an easy one. You love this guy.\nSheldon: Me.\nAmy: Come on, he\xe2\x80\x99s an under-appreciated genius.\nSheldon: Still think it\xe2\x80\x99s me.\nAmy: It\xe2\x80\x99s not you. Now think, there\xe2\x80\x99s a car named after him.\nSheldon: Of course there is. The Mini Cooper, \xe2\x80\x99cause it\xe2\x80\x99s me.\nAmy: How about this, he\xe2\x80\x99s a poor man\xe2\x80\x99s Sheldon Cooper.\nSheldon: Oh, Tesla.\nPenny: Hi.\nAmy: Hello.\nSheldon: Hey, how did it go?\nLeonard: Oh, not fun. The doctor shoved a camera up into my sinuses.\nPenny: Yeah, I watched. It was like the scary boat tunnel in Willy Wonka.\nAmy: Did they figure out what\xe2\x80\x99s wrong?\nLeonard: Yeah. It\xe2\x80\x99s a deviated septum. The surgery to correct it is simple. He\xe2\x80\x99s gonna do it next week.\nSheldon: Why would you have surgery?\nLeonard: Because I can\xe2\x80\x99t breathe. I snore, I get sinus infections.\nPenny: Yeah, back off, he\xe2\x80\x99s all mine.\nSheldon: But you don\xe2\x80\x99t have a life-threatening condition. Why would you take the risk of surgery?\nAmy: Sheldon, it\xe2\x80\x99s a routine procedure, I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard you complain about his snoring.\nSheldon: Yes, for the first five or six years, but I\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten used to it. It helps me sleep. He\xe2\x80\x99s like my mucus-powered white noise machine.\nLeonard: Sheldon, I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna get the surgery, it\xe2\x80\x99s no big deal. End of story.\nSheldon: Very well. I\xe2\x80\x99m done talking about it.\nLeonard: Thank you.\nSheldon: I believe it was your turn in the game.\nAmy: Okay.\nSheldon: Let\xe2\x80\x99s see. Oh, this person is most famous for never having gotten his nose mutilated with elective surgery and never living the rest of his life in the shadows as a hideous, disfigured freak.\nLeonard: I think you could give a better clue.\nSheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t. I\xe2\x80\x99m not even sure if that\xe2\x80\x99s a person or a typo.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom.\nLeonard: Okay, why?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m listening to you snore. I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering how I\xe2\x80\x99ll ever sleep without it.\nLeonard: If it helps you sleep, then why are you sitting here staring at me like the albino boogeyman?\nSheldon: Really Leonard. Insults? After I spent two hours in your closet, waiting for you to fall asleep?\nLeonard: What\xe2\x80\x99s your problem?\nSheldon: If the surgery is successful, the snoring is gone. And if you die during surgery, the snoring is gone.\nLeonard: It sounds like either way, I finally get some rest.\nSheldon: I have to be honest with you Leonard, I\xe2\x80\x99m truly worried.\nLeonard: I told you, there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to worry about.\nSheldon: Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been doing some research and I\xe2\x80\x99ve learned that one in 700,000 people die from general anaesthesia.\nLeonard: Buddy, wh, do you realize that that also means 699,999 people don\xe2\x80\x99t die?\nSheldon: I suppose that\xe2\x80\x99s true. You\xe2\x80\x99re such a glass half-full kind of guy. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to miss that.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nRaj: Oh, so, my, uh, parents\xe2\x80\x99 40th anniversary\xe2\x80\x99s coming up and I can\xe2\x80\x99t think of a thing to get them.\nHoward: Damn, can you imagine being married to someone for 40 years?\nBernadette: Not anymore.\nRaj: Anyway, any ideas on a gift?\nBernadette: Well, what are some of the things they like?\nRaj: They used to like going to the Mumbai Symphony, but last year my mom thought they were phoning it in. Then my dad said based on their love life, she should know about phoning it in.\nBernadette: He said that to her?\nRaj: Well, they weren\xe2\x80\x99t speaking at the time, so he had a servant say it to her. Oh, maybe I could make a gift for them. I know how much you guys love the coasters I made for you.\nBernadette: They\xe2\x80\x99re yours in the divorce.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: Hey. What\xe2\x80\x99re you working on?\nSheldon: Remember when I said if you went through with your surgery, there was a one-in-700,000 chance of dying?\nLeonard: Yeah?\nSheldon: Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been crunching the numbers, and so far, I\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten your probability of death all the way to a sphincter-tightening one in 300.\nLeonard: Great timing. My check sphincter light just went on.\nSheldon: Leonard, what if you have an allergic reaction to the surgeon\xe2\x80\x99s latex gloves?\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m not allergic to latex.\nSheldon: Well, then why don\xe2\x80\x99t you wear the rubber gloves I bought for you to do the dishes?\nLeonard: For the same reason I don\xe2\x80\x99t wear the apron or the hair net.\nSheldon: Fine. What about epilepsy?\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t have epilepsy, either.\nSheldon: You don\xe2\x80\x99t, but the surgeon might, hmm? And your carotid artery is just one shaky scalpel away from becoming the dancing fountain at Disneyland.\nLeonard: Sheldon, do you realize that driving is riskier than surgery?\nSheldon: I do. I have the drive to the hospital right here. That is if you make it to the car without falling down the stairs. And don\xe2\x80\x99t expect me to carry you, I do that enough in life.\nLeonard: Buddy, I, I get that you\xe2\x80\x99re worried about me and I, I appreciate that, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to die.\nSheldon: You don\xe2\x80\x99t know that.\nLeonard: Well, I do know that it won\xe2\x80\x99t be from an asteroid strike.\nSheldon: You know who else said that? Every cocky T. Rex currently swimming around in the gas tank of your car.\nLeonard: If there was an asteroid strike, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you die, too?\nSheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, I\xe2\x80\x99m smart and scrappy, I think I\xe2\x80\x99d find a way.\nLeonard: Tell you what, the surgery\xe2\x80\x99s not for a week, I\xe2\x80\x99ll think about it.\nSheldon: Thank you. And while you\xe2\x80\x99re thinking about it, if you have the surgery in Nicaragua during monsoon season, I can practically guarantee your death.\nScene: Raj\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nRaj (on phone): Yes. Okay. I, I understand. Of course, yes. I\xe2\x80\x99ll call you tomorrow. Bye.\nHoward: So I found this fencing school in Burbank that has a Jedi class. And if you\xe2\x80\x99re cool being the only adults there, they said they are.\nRaj: Dude, my parents just split up.\nHoward: What?\nRaj: Uh, that was my dad on the phone. He moved out.\nHoward: Oh, my God, I, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. I mean, if you\xe2\x80\x99re not up to it, we don\xe2\x80\x99t have to go out, we can just hang here.\nRaj: No, it\xe2\x80\x99s fine. It\xe2\x80\x99s not that big a deal. As long as they\xe2\x80\x99re happy, I\xe2\x80\x99m happy. And when I get to see them for the holidays, I\xe2\x80\x99ll get to celebrate Diwali twice, one at each house. That\xe2\x80\x99s double the Diwali.\nHoward: You sure you\xe2\x80\x99re okay?\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99m okay.\nHoward: You don\xe2\x80\x99t look okay.\nRaj: How can I be okay? I come from a broken home.\nScene: A waiting room.\nLeonard: The doctor said I should be out of surgery by ten.\nPenny: Okay. And Sheldon really believes we\xe2\x80\x99re at a public swimming pool?\nLeonard: He was so busy figuring out how many parts per million of urine we\xe2\x80\x99d be floating around in, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t even question it.\nScene: Amy\xe2\x80\x99s car.\nSheldon: 18 parts per million. And he\xe2\x80\x99s still doing it.\nAmy: Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry about that. I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to take you to work.\nSheldon: Well, thank you. And Leonard never lets me have French toast sticks in the car. I can\xe2\x80\x99t have syrupy fingers, but he can do the backstroke in a toilet bowl.\nAmy: It\xe2\x80\x99s nice they\xe2\x80\x99re getting exercise.\nSheldon: Although now that I think about it, Leonard would never go swimming in public without his swim shirt.\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99m sure he brought it.\nSheldon: No, but last year, at Magic Mountain, he got such a bad sunburn, we had to cut him out of it.\nAmy: He probably got a new one. Finish your breakfast. Look, there\xe2\x80\x99s an entire section of my dashboard that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have any syrup on it.\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re acting odd. Why?\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99m odd all the time, everyone knows that. Just last night I tried to see how many fava beans I could fit in my mouth.\nSheldon: Tell me the truth.\nAmy: Twenty eight.\nSheldon: Come on.\nAmy: Fifty six.\nSheldon: Amy. What\xe2\x80\x99s going on?\nAmy: All right. Don\xe2\x80\x99t get upset, but, an earlier appointment opened up for Leonard and he\xe2\x80\x99s getting the surgery right now.\nSheldon: I see. Take me to Leonard.\nAmy: Just go to work, he\xe2\x80\x99ll be fine.\nSheldon: Amy, he\xe2\x80\x99s my best friend, and if you don\xe2\x80\x99t take me, I\xe2\x80\x99m going there anyway.\nAmy: Fine. It\xe2\x80\x99s sweet that you care about him so much.\nSheldon: I do. And I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be able to forgive myself if something happened to him and I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t at his bedside to say I told you so.\nScene: The waiting room.\nSheldon: Hello.\nPenny: We had a really nice swim.\nSheldon: Oh, stop it. I assume this medical centre\xe2\x80\x99s already treated the burns on your bottom from the recent pants fire.\nPenny: \xe2\x80\x98Cause I\xe2\x80\x99m a liar, liar?\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s for the fire marshal to determine.\nPenny: You had to tell him?\nAmy: He wore me down. And I was distracted, he has on extra baby powder today.\nSheldon: Is he okay?\nPenny: He\xe2\x80\x99s still in surgery.\nSheldon: Very well.\nPenny: He\xe2\x80\x99s gonna be all right. That is sticky.\nAmy: Come on, let\xe2\x80\x99s talk about something other than the surgery.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s a good idea. Penny, did you and Leonard ever discuss funeral arrangements?\nPenny: I think she meant something a little happier.\nSheldon: I suppose we could try to make it a celebration, but he died so young.\nScene: Raj\xe2\x80\x99s office.\nHoward: Knock, knock.\nBernadette: Hi.\nRaj: Hey. What brings you by?\nBernadette: Oh, muffin much.\nHoward: Told you, not funny.\nBernadette: He\xe2\x80\x99s just not laughing because he\xe2\x80\x99s feeling blueberry. Tough crowd.\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. This is very sweet. Thanks.\nHoward: So, how you doing?\nRaj: Better. I guess the news just hit me a lot harder than I expected.\nBernadette: Well, of course. I would be devastated if my parents split up.\nHoward: Why? Your father barely speaks to your mother.\nBernadette: Well, at least he stuck around, not like your dad, who just took off.\nHoward: As you can see, we\xe2\x80\x99re here to cheer you up.\nBernadette: Sorry, Raj. Do you have any sense of what happened with your folks?\nRaj: I think, over time, they started to resent each other, and instead of talking about the things that bothered them, they kept it bottled up, and the hate just grew.\nBernadette: It\xe2\x80\x99s a shame they spent all that time unhappy. But sometimes, there\xe2\x80\x99s muffin you can do about it. You get it, right?\nScene: The waiting room.\nPenny: Oh, it\xe2\x80\x99s nice you got him that.\nSheldon: Oh, this isn\xe2\x80\x99t for Leonard, no. Amy bought it for me.\nAmy: Stubbed his toe on the revolving door on the way in.\nSheldon: You know those confounded things make me dizzy.\nAmy: Who told you to keep going around?\nSheldon: There was a large plant in the lobby. It kept looking like the outside.\nPenny: Okay, listen, when Leonard comes out, he is not gonna feel great, so, please don\xe2\x80\x99t give him a hard time.\nAmy: Penny has a good point. This is like the man in the supermarket with the goiter on his neck. Whatever you\xe2\x80\x99re thinking, just keep it to yourself.\nSheldon: It was like a grapefruit.\nAmy: And I\xe2\x80\x99m sure he knew that before you held a grapefruit up next to it.\nSheldon: Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not making any promises. Not only did Leonard take what I feel is an unnecessary risk, he deceived me.\nPenny: Okay, the reason he deceived you is you were being a pain in the ass.\nSheldon: The reason I was being a pain in the B is because I was worried about him, and no one else was.\nPenny: Really? You won\xe2\x80\x99t even say A?\nSheldon: You bet your sweet B I won\xe2\x80\x99t.\nPenny: Obviously, I care about Leonard. I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna spend the rest of my life with him.\nSheldon: And I\xe2\x80\x99m not? It\xe2\x80\x99s an earthquake. I knew it.\nPenny: Sheldon, it was just a little tremor.\nSheldon: A little tremor that turns routine sinus surgery into a frontal lobotomy. Oh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t care for this at all. Oh, I need to see he\xe2\x80\x99s okay.\nAmy: Sheldon, you can\xe2\x80\x99t go back there.\nSheldon: Try and stop me.\nAmy: Are you okay?\nSheldon: Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you stop me?\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nBernadette: Can I tell you something? This whole thing with Raj\xe2\x80\x99s parents just got me a little worried about us.\nHoward: What are you talking about? We\xe2\x80\x99re fine. And Raj\xe2\x80\x99s parents probably split up because of Raj.\nBernadette: What?\nHoward: They always say the children aren\xe2\x80\x99t to blame, but, come on.\nBernadette: I\xe2\x80\x99m not joking, Howie. You heard what he said about his parents. It was the little things they kept bottled up. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want that to happen to us.\nHoward: How can I convince you it won\xe2\x80\x99t?\nBernadette: Well, is there anything about me you\xe2\x80\x99re keeping inside?\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m not answering that. It\xe2\x80\x99s a trap.\nBernadette: So there are things you don\xe2\x80\x99t like.\nHoward: And here I am in the trap. You just keep talking. I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna chew my leg off.\nBernadette: Just tell me one thing that bothers you, and I promise I won\xe2\x80\x99t get mad.\nHoward: Okay. The truth is, sometimes, you\xe2\x80\x99re too beautiful.\nBernadette: Oh. Howie, be serious.\nHoward: Okay, okay. I really don\xe2\x80\x99t like how your wings poke me when we sleep \xe2\x80\x99cause you\xe2\x80\x99re an angel.\nBernadette: Okay, fine, maybe it was a bad idea.\nHoward: I just don\xe2\x80\x99t think the secret to a happy marriage is going out of our way to criticize each other. Although, there are ways to improve our communication. One thing I learned when I was in couples therapy was\xe2\x80\xa6\nBernadette: Who were you in couples therapy with?\nHoward: Not important.\nBernadette: Was it your mom?\nHoward: Not important.\nBernadette: It was your mom.\nHoward: Anyway, the therapist had us tell each other what we loved about one another.\nBernadette: Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s so sweet. I want to do that.\nHoward: All right.\nBernadette: Okay, um, I love that you make me laugh.\nHoward: Thank you. And I love that you\xe2\x80\x99re strong and independent.\nBernadette: And yet, I still love when you hold a door for me.\nHoward: I love that I\xe2\x80\x99m kind of a slob around here, and you\xe2\x80\x99re okay with that.\nBernadette: Uh-huh. And I love that I work and do all the cleaning, and you\xe2\x80\x99re okay with that.\nHoward: See, I am. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t this great?\nScene: The apartment.\nPenny: Come on, smile. This is gonna be my Christmas card.\nSheldon: You know this is all your fault.\nLeonard: How is it my fault?\nSheldon: I told you not to get the surgery.\nLeonard: Okay, first of all, the surgery was a success, and secondly, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t even want you there.\nSheldon: Wow. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know which hurts worse, my nose or my heart. Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m done speaking to you.\nAmy: Don\xe2\x80\x99t be like that. You two need to talk this out.\nPenny: Yeah, \xe2\x80\x99cause you sound really funny.\nLeonard: Sheldon, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry I didn\xe2\x80\x99t tell you about the surgery, but you were worried about nothing.\nSheldon: Oh, you\xe2\x80\x99re hardly out of the woods, no. You still run the risk of infection, a blood clot, the possibility that an inattentive surgeon let a barn spider lay eggs in your nose. The minute you sneeze web, I\xe2\x80\x99m moving out.\nLeonard: I never thought I\xe2\x80\x99d say these words, but come on, nose spider.\nPenny: Who are you kidding? You were so panicked Leonard was gonna die, you\xe2\x80\x99ll never leave him.\nAmy: Sheldon will move out eventually.\nPenny: Yeah, once he figures out how to work a door.\nSheldon: I was not panicked, and I am not overly attached to Leonard.\nLeonard: You were so worried that you smashed your face trying to check on me. You love me.\nSheldon: Yeah. Tell me those aren\xe2\x80\x99t the words of a man with a spider eating its way through his brain. Amy, you\xe2\x80\x99re a neuroscientist. Crack his skull open, spray some Raid in there.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nBernadette: I love that you take pride in your looks, even when I have to pee in the morning, and you\xe2\x80\x99re in there spending an hour on your hair.\nHoward: I love that you\xe2\x80\x99re too good to pee in the kitchen sink.\nBernadette: I love that you have the confidence to speak, even without giving it an ounce of thought.\nHoward: And I love how your hair is always on the soap. It\xe2\x80\x99s like washing myself with a hamster.\nRaj: Hey, guys. Sorry I am so late. I was on the phone with my mother.\nBernadette: Oh, how is she?\nRaj: Pretty good. She bought the book Eat, Pray, Love and used it to set my father\xe2\x80\x99s Mercedes on fire. So, what\xe2\x80\x99s up with you guys?\nHoward: We\xe2\x80\x99re just saying all the things we love about each other.\nRaj: Oh, like you and I did at couples therapy.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: Oh, what\xe2\x80\x99d you get?\nSheldon: Oh, I ordered it before your surgery. It\xe2\x80\x99s the urn I was going to put you in.\nPenny: Okay, that\xe2\x80\x99s morbid. Send it back.\nSheldon: I can\xe2\x80\x99t send it back, I had it engraved. Here lie the ashes of Leonard Hofstadter. He thought he was right, but his room mate knew better.\xe2\x80\x9d\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99s funny. Boy, I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna miss these painkillers.\nPenny: Hey, why did you get two? I\xe2\x80\x99m with stupid.\nSheldon: Oh, that one\xe2\x80\x99s mine.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
