b'Scene: The apartment.\nPenny: Okay, it\xe2\x80\x99s done. Look, guys, for the future, I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind killing the big spiders, but you have to at least try with the little ones.\nSheldon: Penny, please, we\xe2\x80\x99re facing a far more serious problem than stray arachnids.\nLeonard: Sheldon, it\xe2\x80\x99s not that bad.\nSheldon: Not bad? It\xe2\x80\x99s horrible. I mean, you hear stories about this sort of thing, but you never think it\xe2\x80\x99ll happen to you.\nLeonard: So they steamed your dumplings, get over it. New topic, please.\nHoward: All right, Penny, let me take this opportunity to point out that you are looking particularly ravishing today.\nPenny: Not with a thousand condoms, Howard.\nHoward: So, there is a number.\nPenny: Okay, new topic, please. Hey, did you hear the people upstairs in 5A are moving out?\nLeonard: Shh-shh-shh!\nSheldon: What?\nPenny: The people upstairs are moving out.\nLeonard: No!\nSheldon: The horror!\nLeonard: Why would you just say something like that?\nSheldon: No, no, no, no, no, no, no\xe2\x80\xa6\nPenny: How else was I supposed to say it?\nLeonard: Slowly, like putting a new fish in a tank. You don\xe2\x80\x99t just drop it in, you let the bag sit in the water a while.\nSheldon: The horror!\nPenny: Sheldon, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be fine.\nSheldon: No, it\xe2\x80\x99s not going to be fine, change is never fine. They say it is, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not.\nPenny: Okay, honey, did you even know the people that are moving out?\nSheldon: I never met them. That\xe2\x80\x99s what made them perfect, there were no awkward hellos in the halls, there was no clickety-clacking of high heel shoes on hardwood floors, they may as well have been a family of cats just jumping around from drape to drape without that annoying ammonia urine smell.\nPenny: Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure the new people will be just as quiet.\nSheldon: You can\xe2\x80\x99t know that. How can you possibly know that?\nPenny: You\xe2\x80\x99re right, I can\xe2\x80\x99t. You know what? Anyone could rent that apartment now, an opera singer, the cast of stomp, yeah, a tap-dancing pirate with a wooden leg.\nLeonard: Why are you making it worse?\nPenny: I tried making it better, he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go for it.\nHoward (after Raj whispers to him): You\xe2\x80\x99re right, that\xe2\x80\x99s a great idea.\nLeonard: What?\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99ll take the apartment upstairs. I can finally get away from my mother, and we can all spend some more time together, if you catch my drift.\nPenny: The horror!\nCredits sequence.\nScene: Outside Howard\xe2\x80\x99s house.\nSheldon: Hold on. You honestly expect me to believe that social protocol dictates we break our backs helping Wolowitz move, and then he only need buy us a pizza?\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, that really is how it works.\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re tricking me. You tell me the truth, what do we get?\nLeonard: Raj, help me out here.\nRaj: You get to choose between a mountain bike or a PS3.\nSheldon: I knew it! PS3, definitely  PS3, who would pick a mountain bike?\nHoward (voice from inside): Enough with the guilt, ma, we\xe2\x80\x99ll still see each other. I\xe2\x80\x99ll come over every night and have dinner with you.\nHoward\xe2\x80\x99s Mother (voice): The hell you will! What am I running here, a fancy restaurant? Does this look like Olive Garden?\nHoward (voice): Okay, I get it, you\xe2\x80\x99re angry. You don\xe2\x80\x99t want to see your little bird leave the nest.\nHoward\xe2\x80\x99s Mother (voice): Little bird? You\xe2\x80\x99re almost 30, fly, for god\xe2\x80\x99s sake!\nHoward (voice): Fine, I\xe2\x80\x99ll stay! You happy, crazy lady? I sure as hell hope so, because you\xe2\x80\x99re ruining my life!\nLeonard (into phone): Hey, Penny, it\xe2\x80\x99s Leonard. Good news, you can take your head out of the oven.\nSheldon (removing hernia support): I guess I won\xe2\x80\x99t be needing this.\nScene: The lobby, there are boxes everywhere and removal men are carrying them up the stairs.\nSheldon: Oh, no, the new ones, they\xe2\x80\x99re here.\nLeonard: Stay calm, we don\xe2\x80\x99t know anything about them yet. What are you doing?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m checking for musical instruments. Does that sound like castanets to you?\nLeonard: The box says kitchen.\nSheldon: So? Do cocaine smugglers write cocaine on the box?\nBlonde girl (arriving): Hello?\nLeonard: Hello.\nSheldon: Hello.\nBlonde Girl: Hello.\nLeonard: Hello.\nSheldon: Hello.\nBlonde Girl: I\xe2\x80\x99m Alicia. I\xe2\x80\x99m moving in upstairs.\nLeonard: That is so great. Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m Leonard, I live downstairs. Upstairs from here, but under you. Not under you per se, but under your apartment.\nAlicia: That\xe2\x80\x99s nice.\nLeonard: Yeah, it is.\nSheldon: If that concludes your faltering attempt to mate, hello.\nAlicia: Hello.\nSheldon: Hello. On a scale of one to ten how light of foot would you describe yourself with one being not cat-like at all and ten being freakishly feline?\nAlicia: Freakishly feline?\nSheldon: Is that your answer or do you not understand the question? We\xe2\x80\x99ll come back to that one.\nLeonard: Sheldon\xe2\x80\xa6\nSheldon: Hang on. Are you now or have you ever been a salsa, Irish folk or break-dancer?\nAlicia: No.\nLeonard: You\xe2\x80\x99re making her uncomfortable.\nSheldon: Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. Well, if it helps you feel any better you\xe2\x80\x99re doing very well so far. Next question, are you fertile?\nAlicia: What?!\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to determine whether crying infants above my head are a possibility.\nAlicia: I have no immediate plans.\nSheldon: If that changes, let me know. And finally, area rugs, pro or con?\nAlicia: Pro?\nSheldon: Alicia?\nAlicia: Yes?\nSheldon: Welcome to the building.\nScene: The stairs\nAlicia:Thanks so much for helping me, Leonard.\nLeonard: Thank you so much for giving me the opportunity to help.\nPenny (exiting apartment): Oh, hey, guys.\nLeonard: Hey, Penny. this is Alicia, our new neighbour.\nPenny: Hi.\nAlicia: Hi.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m helping.\nPenny: I can see.\nSheldon: Alicia\xe2\x80\x99s non-musical, childless and pro-rug. She\xe2\x80\x99s still on probation, of course, but I like her.\nAlicia: Cool t-shirt.\nPenny: Oh, yeah, I don\xe2\x80\x99t usually dress like this. I\xe2\x80\x99m going jogging.\nSheldon: You don\xe2\x80\x99t jog.\nPenny: I can start.\nSheldon: True, but the more likely explanation for your attire is that you\xe2\x80\x99re out of clean clothes again.\nPenny: Thank you, Sheldon.\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re welcome, Penny.\nAlicia: Please, you look cute. I\xe2\x80\x99m dressed like a slob today, too.\nLeonard: I think you look fantastic.\nAlicia: This one\xe2\x80\x99s a player, huh?\nPenny: Oh, yeah, be careful.\nAlicia: Thanks for the warning.\nPenny: Okay.\nAlicia: I\xe2\x80\x99ll see you around.\nPenny: See ya. I\xe2\x80\x99m dressed like a slob today, too.\nSheldon: Oh, mimicry. I enjoy mimicry. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been working on Admiral Ackbar from Return of the Jedi. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a trap.\xe2\x80\x9d You have to imagine me with a giant squid head. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a trap. It\xe2\x80\x99s a trap. It\xe2\x80\x99s a trap.\xe2\x80\x9d\nScene: The apartment. Sheldon is writing on an imaginary board. There is a knock on the door.\nSheldon: Come.\nPenny (entering): Hey.\nSheldon: Congratulations, I see you did your laundry.\nPenny: Well, sort of.\nSheldon: How does one sort of\xe2\x80\xa6\nPenny: I bought new clothes, okay? Is Leonard around?\nSheldon: He\xe2\x80\x99s upstairs at Alicia\xe2\x80\x99s.\nPenny: Oh. all right, that\xe2\x80\x99s cool, no biggie. He said he\xe2\x80\x99d help me set up my printer, but I guess I can wait. What exactly is he doing up there?\nSheldon: In what I can only perceive as a tactical move to destroy me, he is with Wolowitz and Koothrappali setting up her stereo.\nPenny: Oh, they\xe2\x80\x99re all up there, huh? Hmm, typical.\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s axiomatically atypical. Up until recently, they did not know Alicia, and had no encounters with her in a previous location. They never went upstairs to visit the former tenants, so your characterization of their behaviour as typical Is demonstrably fallacious.\nPenny: Okay, now I see the giant squid head. (Leaves)\nSheldon: Oh, great! now, I have to start all over again. (Rubs out imaginary workings)\nScene: Alicia\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nHoward: Yeah, I thought about renting this apartment, but I\xe2\x80\x99m really more of a downtown loft kind of guy.\nAlicia: Cool. so are you in a loft now?\nHoward: Oh, actually I\xe2\x80\x99m, uh, living with a woman in Altadena. Purely platonic, she\xe2\x80\x99s also my maid.\nAlicia: Sounds like a sweet deal.\nHoward: I won\xe2\x80\x99t lie, it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty dope.\nPenny (arriving): Hello?\nAlicia: Oh, hey.\nPenny: Hey, I just wanted to bring you a little housewarming gift.\nAlicia: That is so sweet. Come on in, let\xe2\x80\x99s open it.\nPenny: Great.\nAlicia: Nice dress.\nPenny: Oh, this? I\xe2\x80\x99m dressed like a slob today.\nAlicia: The guys have been helping me set up my sound system. I\xe2\x80\x99ve never had such good-looking technical support.\nHoward: Oh, pish-posh. (Raj whispers to him) I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, it means shucks. (Raj whispers again) Shucks means shucks. Let one go once in a while.\nLeonard: Hey, uh, penny, you want to hear something awesome?\nPenny: Yeah.\nLeonard: Alicia is an actress, just like you.\nPenny: That is so awesome.\nAlicia: Well, trying to be, but it\xe2\x80\x99s so hard.\nPenny: Yeah, I know, tell me about it.\nAlicia: I\xe2\x80\x99ve been out here three months, and all I\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten is a couple of national commercials and this recurring thing on a soap.\nPenny: That\xe2\x80\x99s why I work at the Cheesecake Factory, I\xe2\x80\x99m holding out for the right part.\nLeonard: Alicia, what do you want as your default setting for DVDs, 5.1 Dolby or DTS?\nAlicia: Whatever you think is best, cutie.\nLeonard: Well, DTS has more low end, so\xe2\x80\xa6 okay.\nPenny: Uh, hey, guys, guys, you will really appreciate this, I read the best science joke on the internet. Alicia, you won\xe2\x80\x99t get it, but it\xe2\x80\x99s right up their alley. Anyway, so, this physicist goes into an ice cream parlour every week and orders an ice cream sundae for himself, and then offers one to the empty stool sitting next to him. This goes on for a while until the owner finally asks him what he\xe2\x80\x99s doing. The man says, \xe2\x80\x9cwell, I\xe2\x80\x99m a physicist, and quantum mechanics teaches us that it is possible for the matter above this stool to spontaneously turn into a beautiful woman who might accept my offer and fall in love with me.\xe2\x80\x9d The owner then says, \xe2\x80\x9cwell, lots of single, beautiful women come in here every day, why don\xe2\x80\x99t you buy an ice cream for one of them, and they might fall in love with you?\xe2\x80\x9d And the physicist says, \xe2\x80\x9cyeah, but what are the odds of that happening?\xe2\x80\x9d\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s a little insulting, don\xe2\x80\x99t you think?\nPenny: How would I know? I\xe2\x80\x99m not even sure I get it.\nAlicia: Hey, Leonard? If you\xe2\x80\x99re done with the DVD player, can you set up my printer?\nLeonard: Uh, yeah, I\xe2\x80\x99d love to.\nPenny: Uh, hey, maybe when you\xe2\x80\x99re done with her printer, you could set up mine. You know, like you promised a week ago.\nLeonard: Yeah, I\xe2\x80\x99ll get to it, don\xe2\x80\x99t nag me.\nRaj (drinking some wine): Hello there\nScene: The apartment. Penny walks in without knocking and collapses on the sofa.\n  Sheldon: Who is it? Oh hello, Penny, it\xe2\x80\x99s open, come in. Sarcasm.\nPenny: Well, they\xe2\x80\x99re all still up there.\nSheldon: You think I can\xe2\x80\x99t hear them? Listen to that. Stomp, stomp, stomp. That\xe2\x80\x99s Wolowitz in his stacked heels that fool no one.\nPenny: I don\xe2\x80\x99t even know why I care. I don\xe2\x80\x99t care. All right, I cared enough to memorize that stupid joke, but that\xe2\x80\x99s all I care.\nSheldon: You know, Penny, there\xe2\x80\x99s something that occurs in beehives you might find interesting. Occasionally, a new queen will arrive while the old queen is still in power. When this happens, the old queen must either locate to a new hive or engage in a battle to the death until only one queen remains.\nPenny: What are you saying, that I\xe2\x80\x99m threatened by Alicia? That I\xe2\x80\x99m like the old queen of the hive and it\xe2\x80\x99s just time for me to go?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m just talking about bees. They\xe2\x80\x99re on the discovery channel. What are you talking about?\nPenny: Bees. Aaah! I just got that physicist joke.\nScene: The apartment.\n  Leonard: Gee, Penny, thanks for buying us dinner.\nHoward: Yeah, what\xe2\x80\x99s the occasion?\nPenny: No, no occasion, just felt like getting some Chinese chow for my peeps.\nSheldon: Did you remember to ask for the chicken with broccoli to be diced, not shredded?\nPenny: Yes.\nSheldon: Even though the menu description specifies shredded?\nPenny: Yes.\nSheldon: Brown rice, not white?\nPenny: Yes.\nSheldon: You stop at the Korean grocery and get the good hot mustard?\nPenny: Yes.\nSheldon: Did you pick up the low-sodium soy sauce from the market?\nPenny: Yes\nSheldon: Good. See how it\xe2\x80\x99s done, Leonard?\nPenny: So, what do we got going on tonight, huh? Playing Halo watching Battlestar, drop some mentos in diet coke?\nLeonard: You want to watch Battlestar?\nPenny: What can I say? I got my geek on, boys.\nHoward (after Raj whispers to him): No, no, PMS is different. (There is a knock on the door. Leonard answers it.)\n  Alicia: Oh, thank God you\xe2\x80\x99re home. I need help.\nLeonard: What\xe2\x80\x99s wrong?\nAlicia: I just got a callback to audition for CSI to play a hooker who gets killed.\nLeonard: Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99d watch that.\nAlicia: But my car is in the shop, and I have to be at Universal in forty-five minutes.\nLeonard: Okay, well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll take you.\nAlicia: Oh, you\xe2\x80\x99re a lifesaver.\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99ll run lines with you in the car.\nAlicia: Great. And afterward, I\xe2\x80\x99ll take you all out for Chinese.\nPenny: Oh, actually, that\xe2\x80\x99s okay. we already have\xe2\x80\xa6\nHoward: Yum. Starving.\nPenny: \xe2\x80\xa6chinese food right here.\nSheldon: They\xe2\x80\x99re gone, Penny. They can\xe2\x80\x99t hear you.\nPenny: I cannot believe they\xe2\x80\x99re letting her just use them like that. I mean, anything she wants, they go panting after her like trained dogs. You know that just last week, she had Howard drive all the way to her uncle\xe2\x80\x99s house in Orange County to pick up her TV?\nSheldon: You once had Leonard and me get your television from your ex-boyfriend.\nPenny: Apples and oranges here, Sheldon. I\xe2\x80\x99m telling you, that girl is a user, iceskating through the life on her looks, taking advantage of innocent weak-willed men, getting auditions for stupid network shows. It creams my corn.\nSheldon: May I interject something here?\nPenny: Please.\nSheldon: You got the wrong mustard.\nScene: The laundry room.\n  Alicia: Hi.\nPenny:\nAlicia: Guess what? I got the part on CSI.\nPenny: Oh boy.\nAlicia: Something wrong?\nPenny: Uh, no. No, no, no, you know, congratulations, I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll make a great hooker.\nAlicia: Thank you. Hey, I got to ask you something, how much do physicists make?\nPenny: Um, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think a lot.\nAlicia: Yeah, that\xe2\x80\x99s what I figured. Well, got to run, the guys promised to set up my satellite dish and paint my bedroom. Yay!\nPenny: Um, hey, hey, can I talk to you about that for a second?\nAlicia: About what?\nPenny: Well, you know, it\xe2\x80\x99s just that Leonard and Howard and Raj, they aren\xe2\x80\x99t like other guys. They\xe2\x80\x99re special.\nAlicia: Okay, they\xe2\x80\x99re special, and?\nPenny: Oh, let\xe2\x80\x99s see, how can I explain this, um, they don\xe2\x80\x99t know how to use their shields.\nAlicia: Shields?\nPenny: Yeah, you know, like in Star Trek, when you\xe2\x80\x99re in battle and you raise the shields? Where the hell did that come from? Anyways, um, you know how guys like this are, so, please don\xe2\x80\x99t take advantage of them.\nAlicia: Who says I\xe2\x80\x99m taking advantage of them?\nPenny: Come on, they\xe2\x80\x99re doing everything for you, because you\xe2\x80\x99re leading them on.\nAlicia: So I let them do stuff for me. They\xe2\x80\x99re happy. I get stuff. Who cares? And how\xe2\x80\x99s it any different from what you do?\nPenny: Excuse me?\nAlicia: I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen you around them. Are you pretending like you don\xe2\x80\x99t do the exact same thing?\nPenny: Okay, lady, you are way out of line.\nAlicia: Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m out of line?\nPenny: Yeah, you\xe2\x80\x99re out of line.\nAlicia: Well, what are you going to do about it, bitch?\nScene: Outside the building.\nRaj: I like green lantern, I\xe2\x80\x99m just saying it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty lame that He can be defeated by the colour yellow.\nSheldon: Only the modern green lantern is vulnerable to yellow.\nLeonard: Golden age green lantern was vulnerable to wood.\nRaj: Great, so I can take them both out with a number-two pencil?\nHoward: Oh, my God! Girl fight! (He grabs Leonard)\nLeonard: What are you doing?\nHoward: I know you. you\xe2\x80\x99re stupid enough to break it up.\nScene: The apartment. Penny has a black eye.\n  Howard: May I say you look very comely tonight?\nPenny: Thank you.\nHoward: You\xe2\x80\x99re right, this filly\xe2\x80\x99s been broken.\nSheldon (as music comes down through ceiling): You set it on DTS, didn\xe2\x80\x99t you?\nLeonard: I had to, she called me cutie.\nHoward: According to Alicia\xe2\x80\x99s facebook page, she\xe2\x80\x99s hooking up with one of the producers on CSI.\nPenny: Well, dead whore on TV, live one in real life.\nSheldon: Oh, great now she\xe2\x80\x99s jumping up and down on the bed.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
