b'Scene: The apartment.\nAmy: Can you believe it\xe2\x80\x99s been five years since our first date?\nSheldon: I know. Do you think I should start watching The Flash TV show?\nAmy: That\xe2\x80\x99s what you\xe2\x80\x99re thinking about?\nSheldon: Well, one of the things.\nAmy: Are any of them me?\nSheldon: Yes. I thought, I can\xe2\x80\x99t decide if I should watch The Flash TV show. I know, I\xe2\x80\x99ll ask Amy. Anyway.\nAmy: What are you doing?\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re right, you did kind of kill the mood.\nAmy: I didn\xe2\x80\x99t kill anything. You did, talking about your stupid TV show.\nSheldon: Excuse me. Starting to watch a television show that might run for years isn\xe2\x80\x99t a decision to take lightly. I\xe2\x80\x99m wrestling with a big commitment issue here.\nAmy: Really? That\xe2\x80\x99s the commitment issue you\xe2\x80\x99re wrestling with? Sheldon, do you understand the irony of your fixation on a man with super speed, while after five years all I can get out of you is a distracted make-out session on a couch?\nSheldon: Irony\xe2\x80\x99s not really my strong suit. But I have been getting better with sarcasm, if you want to give that a try.\nAmy: Oh, sure, I\xe2\x80\x99d love to.\nSheldon: Whenever you\xe2\x80\x99re ready.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The comic book store.\nStuart: I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to rush you, but I\xe2\x80\x99m closing a little early tonight.\nRaj: Ooh. Hot date?\nStuart: Uh, no. I overheard Bernadette tell Howard she was making him a meat loaf, and you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to not ask me twice.\nEmily: If I stick a light bulb on this, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it make a great lamp for my bedroom?\nRaj: You\xe2\x80\x99re kidding, right?\nEmily: Oh. Is this freaking you out?\nRaj: I guess I\xe2\x80\x99m just more of a Pottery Barn, Crate and Barrel kind of guy. Maybe Pier 1 if I really want to cut loose.\nEmily: All right. Never mind.\nRaj: No, no, no. Hey, you should totally get it. In fact, I\xe2\x80\x99ll buy it for you.\nStuart: Sold.\nEmily: Raj, you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to do that.\nStuart: Too late. No returns.\nScene: The stairwell.\nLeonard: That was really intense.\nPenny: Well, now we know, next time we go to the farmers\xe2\x80\x99 market, the order is petting zoo first, then buy vegetables.\nLeonard: Hey.\nSheldon: Oh, good. You\xe2\x80\x99re here. I need your assistance.\nLeonard: Can it wait until I put a Band-Aid on a goat bite?\nSheldon: What happened?\nPenny: Oh, your buddy got mugged by some baby farm animals.\nSheldon: Been there.\nPenny: Mmm. So what do you need help with?\nSheldon: Amy\xe2\x80\x99s mad at me, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not clear why.\nPenny: Okay. Were you talking before she got upset?\nSheldon: Yes.\nPenny: That\xe2\x80\x99s probably it. What\xe2\x80\x99d you say to her?\nSheldon: Well, I just asked her if I should start watching the new Flash TV series.\nPenny: And that made her angry?\nSheldon: Baffling, right? We were necking like a couple of hooligans under the school bleachers. I stopped so I could ask the question. Next thing I know, good-bye, kissy face. Hello, yelly face.\nPenny: Well, Sheldon, when you\xe2\x80\x99re kissing a girl, she expects the attention to be on her.\nSheldon: It was. I asked her if she thought I should watch The Flash.\nPenny: Yeah. I\xe2\x80\x99m tapping out. Leonard?\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna guess that your main concern is the time commitment of watching an entire season of a new show.\nSheldon: Oh, no, not just a season. If I\xe2\x80\x99m in, I\xe2\x80\x99m in for the whole run, even if the quality declines.\nLeonard: I get it. Smallville almost wrecked you.\nSheldon: Yeah. Exactly. You know, I waited ten years to see a guy everyone knows can fly, fly.\nPenny: Wait, what is wrong with you two? He was talking about television during their date night.\nSheldon: Oh, not just date night, our fifth anniversary.\nPenny: Okay, see, that\xe2\x80\x99s even dumber than you wondering if being bitten by a goat would give you the powers of a goat.\nSheldon: If that happens, don\xe2\x80\x99t make me wait ten years to watch you eat a tin can.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s house.\nRaj: You guys ever notice that Emily has a bit of a twisted side?\nBernadette: You mean \xe2\x80\x99cause she has weird tattoos?\nRaj: No, because she wants to have sex with me in a graveyard.\nHoward: One more time?\nRaj: She and I were supposed to watch the new Avengers movie tonight, but it was sold out. So I said, what else do you want to do? She said, let\xe2\x80\x99s go to a cemetery and do it on somebody\xe2\x80\x99s grave.\nHoward: Like, a random person or somebody she knew?\nRaj: What difference does it make?\nHoward: Well, if it\xe2\x80\x99s her father\xe2\x80\x99s grave and they didn\xe2\x80\x99t get along, then you know she holds a grudge.\nBernadette: The only issue is that everybody has their own thing, and as long as it\xe2\x80\x99s two consenting adults, I guess I don\xe2\x80\x99t see the harm in it.\nRaj: Well, what if it\xe2\x80\x99s one consenting adult and one adult who pretends to consent because he\xe2\x80\x99s afraid of being alone?\nBernadette: Well, then I guess bring a blanket. The grass gets damp at night.\nRaj: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, guys. Maybe this relationship isn\xe2\x80\x99t for me. Maybe I should break up with her.\nHoward: Right. You\xe2\x80\x99re gonna break up with a girl who has sex with you. Can you believe this guy?\nBernadette: I think if Raj wants to break up with a girl, he can do it.\nHoward: How are you saying that with a straight face?\nBernadette: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\nRaj: You guys are being jerks.\nHoward: Buddy, other than Jenny Craig, you\xe2\x80\x99ve never broken up with a girl in your life.\nRaj: You\xe2\x80\x99re one to talk. You\xe2\x80\x99ve been complaining about Stuart living here for the past year. I don\xe2\x80\x99t see you showing him the door.\nHoward: That\xe2\x80\x99s not the same thing. Emily\xe2\x80\x99s a person. Stuart\xe2\x80\x99s more like an infestation, something you spray for.\nRaj: Baloney, okay? You two are as afraid of hurting someone\xe2\x80\x99s feelings as I am.\nBernadette: That\xe2\x80\x99s not true. We were just laughing right in your face.\nScene: The apartment.\nPenny: Thanks for cooking.\nLeonard: Mmm. My pleasure.\nPenny: That carrot was delicious.\nLeonard: Yeah. I wish I\xe2\x80\x99d fought harder for the rest of \xe2\x80\x99em.\nPenny: Still haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard from her?\nSheldon: No, and I\xe2\x80\x99m confused. It\xe2\x80\x99s been nearly 24 hours. Amy should have figured out she\xe2\x80\x99s wrong by now.\nPenny: Hey, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think she\xe2\x80\x99s wrong about you going too slow in the relationship.\nSheldon: Too slow?\nPenny: Yeah, you\xe2\x80\x99ve been going out for years. You haven\xe2\x80\x99t even slept together.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s right. It\xe2\x80\x99s called foreplay. And I could make the case that you two aren\xe2\x80\x99t moving forward in your relationship.\nPenny: Uh, hello.\nSheldon: Hello.\nPenny: No. Sheldon, we\xe2\x80\x99re getting married.\nSheldon: But you\xe2\x80\x99ve been engaged for over a year now, and you don\xe2\x80\x99t even have a wedding date.\nPenny: Well, we will. We\xe2\x80\x99re just not in a rush.\nSheldon: Okay.\nLeonard: We\xe2\x80\x99re gonna set a date.\nSheldon: Okay. If you say so.\nPenny: Yeah, it\xe2\x80\x99s just, things are good right now.\nLeonard: Really good.\nPenny: I\xe2\x80\x99m focusing on my job.\nLeonard: And we\xe2\x80\x99ve been busy with our paper.\nPenny: So busy.\nLeonard: Yeah, we\xe2\x80\x99ll pick a date when we pick a date.\nPenny: Yeah.\nSheldon: Okay.\nPenny: You know, I can see why Amy\xe2\x80\x99s mad at you.\nSheldon: Yeah, shut up, Sheldon.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s house.\nBernadette: Did you eat all my yoghurt?\nHoward: You mean the one that makes ladies do the thing that ladies pretend they don\xe2\x80\x99t do even though they do?\nBernadette: You know which yoghurt I mean.\nHoward: I didn\xe2\x80\x99t touch it. Must have been Stuart.\nBernadette: Maybe Raj is right. Maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s time we tell him he needs to move out.\nHoward: We should have done it months ago.\nBernadette: I know, but his store was reopening, and then there were the holidays, and then he was sick.\nHoward: Yeah, right. Sick. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t have jaundice. He just looks like that.\nBernadette: All right. Tonight\xe2\x80\x99s the night.\nHoward: Agreed. When he gets home, I\xe2\x80\x99m dropping the hammer.\nBernadette: Ooh, I like when you take charge.\nHoward: Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m not taking charge, you\xe2\x80\x99re the hammer.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: So, why haven\xe2\x80\x99t we picked a date?\nPenny: You know why.\nLeonard: Well, of course I know why. But just for fun, why?\nPenny: Not in a rush, busy with work\xe2\x80\xa6\nSheldon: Things are good right now.\nPenny: Really good.\nLeonard: You still want to get married, right?\nPenny: Oh, my God. Yes. Why would you even ask that?\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Because we don\xe2\x80\x99t have a date?\nPenny: Well, you want a date, pick a date.\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s not just the date. We haven\xe2\x80\x99t talked about anything. Big wedding, small wedding, indoor, outdoor?\nSheldon: Outdoor? Oh. I can RSVP no right now.\nPenny: Okay, indoor it is. Big or small?\nLeonard: Is your dad paying for it?\nPenny: I doubt it.\nLeonard: Okay, two friends each.\nPenny: All right, well, I want it in a church.\nLeonard: Fine. I want black-tie.\nPenny: Fine. I want to release butterflies.\nSheldon: Seriously? Airborne worms?\nLeonard: Okay. Well, then it\xe2\x80\x99s settled. Small indoor church wedding, black-tie, no butterflies.\nPenny: Sounds perfect.\nLeonard: Great.\nSheldon: You still didn\xe2\x80\x99t pick a date.\nPenny: Stay out of it.\nLeonard: Shut up.\nScene: A graveyard.\nEmily: Mmm. It\xe2\x80\x99s a beautiful night.\nRaj: Oh, yes, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got the moon and the trees and Elizabeth McNulty, who apparently died when she was the same age I am.\nEmily: Makes you feel alive, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\nRaj: So does enjoying a meal at a well-lit restaurant, but here we are.\nEmily: You aren\xe2\x80\x99t scared, are you?\nRaj: Of ghosts, no. Of you, little bit.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry I\xe2\x80\x99ve upset you. I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have asked so many questions.\nPenny: No, it\xe2\x80\x99s okay.\nLeonard: Yeah, maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s good you got us talking about this stuff.\nSheldon: Well, look at that, even when I\xe2\x80\x99m causing problems, I make the world a better place. Hey, next, why don\xe2\x80\x99t we tackle your penchant for whining and Penny\xe2\x80\x99s love of the ol\xe2\x80\x99 glug-glug?\nPenny: Uh, Sheldon, I think we\xe2\x80\x99re good for now.\nSheldon: Ah, well, very well. So does this mean you\xe2\x80\x99ll finally pick a wedding date?\nPenny: Here we go again. Why is everyone so concerned with us setting a date? We\xe2\x80\x99re committed to each other. We\xe2\x80\x99re happy. A ceremony isn\xe2\x80\x99t gonna change anything.\nSheldon: So you\xe2\x80\x99re never getting married? It\xe2\x80\x99s his whining, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\nLeonard: Sheldon, I\xe2\x80\x99m not a whiner.\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s amusing that he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t hear it.\nLeonard: Look, all she\xe2\x80\x99s saying is we are in love so it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter if we get married tomorrow or a year from now or 50 years from now.\nPenny: Ew, 50? We\xe2\x80\x99ll be old and gross.\nLeonard: Yeah, but we\xe2\x80\x99ll be old and gross together.\nSheldon: My aunt and uncle were married 63 years. Towards the end, it was like watching cheese melt.\nPenny: Um, I\xe2\x80\x99m free tonight.\nLeonard: Are you saying you want to get married?\nPenny: Vegas isn\xe2\x80\x99t that far away.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m in. Let\xe2\x80\x99s do it.\nSheldon: After all these years. I\xe2\x80\x99m really happy for the two of you.\nPenny: Oh, thank you.\nLeonard: Thanks.\nSheldon: Now get out of my spot.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s house.\nHoward: Bernie, Stuart just pulled up. So remember, the key is to be firm. Show no weakness.\nBernadette: Right.\nHoward: Good luck.\nBernadette: Howard Joel Wolowitz, you get back here.\nHoward: Never should have told you my middle name.\nStuart: Hey, guys.\nHoward: Hey, you got a minute?\nStuart: Sure. Uh, let me just put this stuff in the fridge. I felt bad for finishing your yoghurt, so I bought more. And, Howard, your favourite fruit is in season. Crunch Berries.\nBernadette: Don\xe2\x80\x99t let that sway you.\nHoward: It\xe2\x80\x99s hard not to. They taste so much better than real berries.\nStuart: What\xe2\x80\x99s up?\nBernadette: So, we need to talk.\nScene: The graveyard.\nEmily: You okay?\nRaj: I think we should talk.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s house.\nStuart: Is everything okay?\nBernadette: Well, you\xe2\x80\x99ve been living here a while now.\nStuart: I know. I may sell comic books at work, but the real superheroes are sitting right in front of me.\nBernadette: Yeah.\nHoward: His middle name is David. Go.\nScene: The graveyard.\nRaj: Look, I care about you a lot, but we are very different people.\nEmily: Are you breaking up with me?\nRaj: No, no, I\xe2\x80\x99m just pointing out that you\xe2\x80\x99re dark on the inside and I\xe2\x80\x99m dark on the outside.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s house.\nBernadette: So, anyway, what I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to say is\xe2\x80\xa6 (phone rings)\nHoward: You need to take that?\nStuart: It\xe2\x80\x99s just my dad, probably calling to wish me a happy birthday. I\xe2\x80\x99ll call him back. You were saying?\nScene: The graveyard.\nEmily: Look, Raj, be honest with me. If you want to end things, just do it. Don\xe2\x80\x99t expect me to do it for you.\nRaj: End things? I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to tell you that I love you.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s house.\nHoward and Bernadette (singing): Happy birthday to you.\nScene: Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s car.\nPenny: Wow, there\xe2\x80\x99s a Denny\xe2\x80\x99s in Vegas you can actually get married in.\nLeonard: Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t sound very romantic.\nPenny: Yeah, but we could get heart-shaped pancakes.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m sure we\xe2\x80\x99ll find a decent chapel.\nPenny: Yeah. This is crazy.\nLeonard: I know. You think people are gonna be mad?\nPenny: Maybe. But this isn\xe2\x80\x99t about them, it\xe2\x80\x99s about us.\nLeonard: It is. It is about us.\nPenny: And you know what the best part is? We took our time. I mean, we met, we were friends for a couple years, then we got together, and then we got untogether, then we worked out all our problems, and now we know everything about each other, we can just go forward with no surprises and no regrets.\nLeonard: Right. No surprises.\nPenny: And no regrets.\nLeonard: Uh, well, there, there\xe2\x80\x99s one thing I feel I should tell you.\nPenny: What?\nLeonard: You know, so we can go into this with no secrets between us.\nPenny: What?\nLeonard: Remember, uh, a couple years back when I was on that research ship in the North Sea?\nPenny: Yeah.\nLeonard: Okay, well, there, there was a lot of drinking and craziness going on.\nPenny: No, you told me.\nLeonard: Okay, um, well, there was this girl.\nPenny: What did you do?\nLeonard: Nothing really. It was just kissing.\nPenny: And then what?\nLeonard: And then nothing. I stopped it. But it still bothers me, and I wanted you to know.\nPenny: All right.\nLeonard: Did you ever do anything like this since we\xe2\x80\x99ve been?\nPenny: Nope, never.\nLeonard: Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s too bad.\nPenny: You know, can I ask you a question?\nLeonard: Hmm?\nPenny: Why are you telling me this now?\nLeonard: Well, like I said, we\xe2\x80\x99re about to get married, and I, I want a clean slate. No secrets.\nPenny: Really? Because to me, it seems like we\xe2\x80\x99re about to get married and you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to sabotage it.\nLeonard: Would you rather I didn\xe2\x80\x99t tell you?\nPenny: No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want there to be secrets between us.\nLeonard: See, now I\xe2\x80\x99m confused. I mean, what, what am I supposed to do?\nPenny: Uh, keep your mouth off other women.\nLeonard: I can do that. Uh, uh, from now on, this mouth, you and food, that\xe2\x80\x99s it.\nPenny: Okay.\nLeonard: Yeah?\nPenny: Look, I\xe2\x80\x99m not happy this happened, but I think I can get past it. I mean, we weren\xe2\x80\x99t engaged at the time, and it was just kissing.\nLeonard: Right.\nPenny: Just kissing.\nLeonard: It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t even very good. She was a smoker, I\xe2\x80\x99d just been seasick.\nPenny: Okay, that\xe2\x80\x99s enough. Stop talking.\nLeonard: So, we\xe2\x80\x99re still getting married?\nPenny: Yes.\nLeonard: Because we love each other.\nPenny: Yes.\nLeonard: And it\xe2\x80\x99s the happiest day of our lives.\nPenny: Ha-ha, don\xe2\x80\x99t push it.\nScene: The apartment.\nAmy (on skype): Hello.\nSheldon: Hello. Listen, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been thinking a lot about relationships and how difficult they can be, and I think\xe2\x80\xa6\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99ve been thinking about them, too, Sheldon. Being your girlfriend is so challenging. Emotionally, physically. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been incredibly patient for years.\nSheldon: Strongly disagree. Go on.\nAmy: Okay, well, this isn\xe2\x80\x99t easy to say, because I love you, but I need some time to take a step back and re-evaluate our situation.\nSheldon: Oh.\nAmy: I hope you understand.\nSheldon: Okay.\nAmy: Bye, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Well, Gollum, you\xe2\x80\x99re an expert on rings. What do I do with this one?\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
