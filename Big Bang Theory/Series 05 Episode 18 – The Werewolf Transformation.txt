b'Scene: A barber\xe2\x80\x99s shop.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m just gonna run to the store and get a few things. I\xe2\x80\x99ll pick you up when you\xe2\x80\x99re done.\nSheldon: Okay. I like it a little better when you stay, but all right.\nBarber: Hey, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Hello. I\xe2\x80\x99m here for my haircut with Mr. D\xe2\x80\x99Onofrio.\nBarber: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, Uncle Tony\xe2\x80\x99s in the hospital. He\xe2\x80\x99s pretty sick.\nSheldon: Oh, dear, Mr. D\xe2\x80\x99Onofrio\xe2\x80\x99s in the hospital. Why do these things always happen to me?\nBarber: I can cut it for you.\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re not Mr. D\xe2\x80\x99Onofrio. I get my hair cut by Mr. D\xe2\x80\x99Onofrio. You believe this guy?\nLeonard: Excuse us for a second. Sheldon, it\xe2\x80\x99s okay, he can do it. He\xe2\x80\x99s a barber.\nSheldon: He\xe2\x80\x99s not a barber, he\xe2\x80\x99s the nephew. He\xe2\x80\x99s an example of the kind of nepotism that runs rampant in the barbering industry. Besides, Mr. D\xe2\x80\x99Onofrio knows exactly how I like my hair done because he has all my haircut records from my barber in Texas.\nLeonard: What are you talking about?\nSheldon: When I first moved here I was nervous about finding a new barber, so my mother had all my haircut records sent here to Mr. D\xe2\x80\x99Onofrio.\nLeonard: There\xe2\x80\x99s no such thing as haircut records.\nSheldon: Yes, there are.\nLeonard: Have you ever seen them?\nSheldon: No, but my mother assured me they were sent here, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll bet you dollars to doughnuts that this one doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have them. Uh, excuse me. Do you have access to my haircut records?\nBarber: Your what?\nSheldon: To paraphrase T.S. Eliot, this is the way the world ends, not with a bang but with a nephew.\nLeonard: Sheldon, you\xe2\x80\x99re a grown man, he\xe2\x80\x99s a professional, and your haircut is number three on that poster from 1946. Just sit down and let him do it.\nSheldon: Fine, but if I come out of this looking like a dork, it\xe2\x80\x99s on you. (Sits)\nBarber: So my kid said the funniest thing today.\nSheldon: Nope. (Runs out)\nLeonard: When you tell this story later, the word we usually use is quirky.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Can you pass the Parmesan cheese?\nLeonard: Sure. What are you doing?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to get the hair out of my eyes.\nLeonard: Sheldon, you are one day late for your haircut.\nSheldon: Thank you for captioning my nightmare.\nHoward: Lookie here, I got my travel orders.\nRaj: Payload Specialist Howard Wolowitz is requested to report to the NASA Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas, for astronaut training Monday eight a.m.\nHoward: Yeah, but it\xe2\x80\x99s from NASA, so it\xe2\x80\x99s oh eight hundred.\nRaj: But it says eight a.m.\nHoward: You read it as oh eight hundred.\nRaj: It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have an oh in front of it.\nHoward: You know what does have an oh in front of it? Oh, my God, I\xe2\x80\x99m an astronaut, and you\xe2\x80\x99re dying of jealousy.\nLeonard: So, what kind of things are they\xe2\x80\xa6 (to Sheldon) will you stop that?\nSheldon: I can\xe2\x80\x99t help it, I feel like a teen heartthrob.\nPenny: You know, Sheldon, I used to cut my brother\xe2\x80\x99s hair. I could do it for you.\nSheldon: Penny, I know you mean well, offering the skills of the hill folk, but, um, here in town we don\xe2\x80\x99t churn our own butter, we don\xe2\x80\x99t, uh, make dresses out of gunny sacks, and, uh, we sure as shootin\xe2\x80\x99 don\xe2\x80\x99t get our hair cut by bottle-blonde\xe2\x80\xa6\nLeonard: Sheldon, be nice.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, it\xe2\x80\x99s the bad boy attitude that comes with this hair.\nRaj: You could go to my guy. He\xe2\x80\x99s at Juan-Juan in Beverly Hills. They bring you a cup of tea, they\xe2\x80\x99ll massage your scalp. It\xe2\x80\x99s about two hundred dollars, but sometimes you look in the next chair and you see a superstar like Tony Danza.\nHoward: Quick question here, have we actually changed the conversation from I\xe2\x80\x99m going\nto astronaut training to Sheldon can\xe2\x80\x99t get a haircut?\nRaj: Now who\xe2\x80\x99s dying of jealousy? Oh, it\xe2\x80\x99s you.\nScene: Amy\xe2\x80\x99s apartment. Amy is playing her harp.\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99m a cowboy, on a steel horse I ride. I\xe2\x80\x99m wanted\xe2\x80\xa6 I\xe2\x80\x99m wanted\xe2\x80\xa6 wanted, dead or alive. Sheldon, you\xe2\x80\x99re ruining girlfriend-boyfriend sing-along night.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. I\xe2\x80\x99m looking for a barber and I\xe2\x80\x99m running out of time. My hair is growing at the rate of 4.6 yoctometers per femtosecond. I mean, if you\xe2\x80\x99re quiet, you can hear it.\nAmy: What about Supercuts?\nSheldon: I tried once. They do men\xe2\x80\x99s and women\xe2\x80\x99s hair in the same room at the same time. It\xe2\x80\x99s like Sodom and Gomorrah with mousse.\nAmy: Well, this isn\xe2\x80\x99t a crisis. Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you just let your hair grow out a little?\nSheldon: Why don\xe2\x80\x99t I let my hair grow out? Um, why don\xe2\x80\x99t I start wearing Birkenstocks and, uh, uh, seeking validation of my opinions by asking can you dig it?\nAmy: Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I think you might look sexy with long hair. The kind that flows down to your shoulders and blows back while riding on a horse, bareback and bare-chested. I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna go brush my teeth, it might take a while.\nScene: Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom.\nHoward (on Skype): Hi.\nBernadette: Hi, sweetie.\nHoward: I miss you.\nBernadette: I miss you, too. So tell me all about your first day.\nHoward: Oh, wow, where do I even start? I got to experience zero gravity.\nBernadette: Cool. How do they do that?\nHoward: It\xe2\x80\x99s pretty neat. You get in this plane that goes almost straight up for, like, 20 seconds, and then straight back down like it\xe2\x80\x99s going to crash, and they do it over and over again, you know, no matter how many times you throw up.\nBernadette: You threw up?\nHoward: Yeah, and the craziest part is, because there\xe2\x80\x99s no gravity, the throw-up kind of floats there, in a little ball, and if your mouth is open because you\xe2\x80\x99re screaming, sometimes it just floats right back in. Boy, does everyone laugh at you when that happens.\nBernadette: That sounds mean.\nHoward: No. Yeah, I would have laughed, too, but I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want the vomit to come back out. Anyway, oh, could you do me a favour and overnight me some more underwear?\nBernadette: Sure, why?\nHoward: I got a look at the centrifuge they\xe2\x80\x99re going to spin me around in tomorrow, and I have a hunch I packed a little light.\nScene: A hospital ward.\nSheldon: Mr. D\xe2\x80\x99Onofrio? It\xe2\x80\x99s Sheldon. They didn\xe2\x80\x99t have anything barber-themed in the gift shop, so I got you this. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if you can read his little T-shirt. It says, um, get well bear-y soon. Trust me, if you were even a little conscious right now, you\xe2\x80\x99d be laughing. Anyway, there\xe2\x80\x99s new studies that show, people in comas are aware of everything going on around them. With that in mind, if you can hear me, move away from the light and toward the sound of these scissors.\nNurse: Can I help you?\nSheldon: Yes. Do you have something I could use as a cape?\nNurse: Oh, dear, did we spit out our pills, slip out of the ninth floor, and go on a little adventure?\nSheldon: Oh, no, no, I\xe2\x80\x99m just here to get my hair cut.\nNurse: I-I see. J-Jus-Just wait here one moment. Security!\nSheldon: I got to run. But not with scissors, that would be unsafe.\nScene: The apartment.\nPenny: So, if I move my horsey here, isn\xe2\x80\x99t that checkmate and I win?\nLeonard: Hmm.\nPenny: Well, is it or isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\nLeonard: You know, I think this is a good stopping point. Uh, it\xe2\x80\x99s your first real game. I threw a lot of information at you.\nPenny: Well, no, I mean, your king is trapped. He can\xe2\x80\x99t go here because of my lighthouse, and he can\xe2\x80\x99t go here because of my pointy-head guy.\nLeonard: Like I said, complicated game.\nPenny: So did I win or not?\nLeonard: Did you have fun? Because if you had fun, then you are, you are a winner. Now that\xe2\x80\x99s, that-that\xe2\x80\x99s what chess is all about.\nSheldon: Hello.\nLeonard: Hey.\nPenny: Oh, hey. Sorry, Sheldon, I\xe2\x80\x99ll move.\nSheldon: Eh, why? My spot, your spot, what difference does it make?\nPenny: Okay, what just happened?\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Between you playing chess like Bobby Fischer and Sheldon being okay with you in his spot, I\xe2\x80\x99m guessing someone went back in time, stepped on a bug, and changed the course of human events.\nPenny: Uh, sweetie, are you all right?\nSheldon: No, I\xe2\x80\x99m not all right. It\xe2\x80\x99s been six days since I was supposed to get a haircut and nothing horrible has happened.\nPenny: Okay, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand.\nSheldon: Leonard, explain it to her.\nLeonard: Oh, uh, he\xe2\x80\x99s crazy.\nSheldon: I have spent my whole life trying to bring order to the universe by carefully planning every moment of every day. But all my efforts, our dinner schedule, my pyjama rotation, my bowel movement spreadsheet, it\xe2\x80\x99s clear now, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been wasting my time.\nLeonard: Good. I\xe2\x80\x99m taking that disgusting chart off the fridge.\nPenny: You know, Sh-Sheldon, sometimes it\xe2\x80\x99s nice not knowing what\xe2\x80\x99s coming. I mean, look at me and Leonard. We went out, we broke up, now we\xe2\x80\x99re trying again. We don\xe2\x80\x99t know what\xe2\x80\x99s gonna happen.\nSheldon: Oh, please, everyone knows what\xe2\x80\x99s going to happen. But I see your point.\nLeonard: I think this could be good for you. Maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s time for you to shake things up a bit.\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re right. I should embrace the chaos.\nLeonard: Great. What are you going to do first?\nSheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I could do anything. All bets are off. The world is my oyster. I got it. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to put on my Tuesday pyjamas tonight.\nLeonard: I got to tell you, I\xe2\x80\x99m a little worried about him.\nPenny: If I were you, I\xe2\x80\x99d be worried that a girl who\xe2\x80\x99s never played chess in her life just kicked your ass.\nScene: Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom.\nHoward (on Skype): Hi.\nBernadette: Howie, what happened to you?\nHoward: We did overnight survival training in the wilderness. Big fun. Big, big fun. I was gonna freshen up for you but I blacked out a little on the way to the bathroom.\nBernadette: Survival training? Is that like camping?\nHoward: Uh-huh. Except you don\xe2\x80\x99t have food or water, and they don\xe2\x80\x99t have a sunset Sabbath service like they do at Camp Hess-Kramer.\nBernadette: Do you sleep in tents?\nHoward: No. I slept in a hole I dug in the ground with my bare hands. And at some point during the night, an armadillo crawled in and spooned me.\nBernadette: Poor baby.\nHoward: But I did it. I survived. I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure I was going to when the sandstorm hit. I just pulled my turtleneck up over my head and waited for death. But somehow as I sat there, wrapped in a cocoon of my own neck-sweat, I found that primal part of the human spirit that just wants to keep on living, no matter what the cost.\nBernadette: You\xe2\x80\x99re so brave. I\xe2\x80\x99m proud of you.\nHoward: I ate a butterfly. It was so small and beautiful, but I was so hungry.\nBernadette: Are you crying?\nHoward: No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s possible. I\xe2\x80\x99m severely dehydrated. My pee is like toothpaste.\nBernadette: Howie, if you\xe2\x80\x99re not able to do this, come home. It won\xe2\x80\x99t change how I feel about you.\nHoward: Thanks, honey, but I can\xe2\x80\x99t quit. If I do, I\xe2\x80\x99ll just be a guy who had a chance to be an astronaut and gave it up.\nBernadette: Well, is there anything I could do to help?\nHoward: No. Wait. Send more underwear.\nScene: Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom. Leonard wakes to the sound of bongos.\nLeonard (going to living room): Don\xe2\x80\x99t let this be Sheldon playing bongos. Please don\xe2\x80\x99t let this be Sheldon playing bongos.\nSheldon: Hello, Leonard, do you like my bongos? Bet you didn\xe2\x80\x99t know that I had bongos.\nLeonard: Sheldon, it\xe2\x80\x99s three o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning.\nSheldon: Three in the morning is a good time for bongos.\nLeonard: I was sleeping.\nSheldon: Leonard sleeps while I play bongos.\nLeonard: No, he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t.\nSheldon: Leonard no sleep while I play bongos. Bongo solo.\nLeonard: Stop! Stop it! Stop! Stop! Stop it!\nPenny (entering): What the hell?!\nLeonard: Oh, hi, Penny, guess what? Sheldon got bongos.\nPenny: Why did you get bongos?\nSheldon: Richard Feynman played the bongos. I thought I\xe2\x80\x99d give that a try.\nLeonard: Richard Feynman was a famous physicist.\nPenny: Oh, Leonard, it\xe2\x80\x99s three o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning. I don\xe2\x80\x99t care if Richard Feynman was a purple leprechaun who lived in my butt.\nSheldon: Penny meant if he were a purple leprechaun. Penny forgot to use the subjunctive.\nLeonard: Sheldon, go to bed. You have work in the morning.\nSheldon: Maybe, maybe not. Maybe tomorrow I start a bongo band and tour the world.\nLeonard: W-w-wuh, no, no, hang on,uh, uh, roommate agreement. No hootenannies, sing-a-longs, or barbershop quartets after ten p.m.\nSheldon: Roommate agreement? Are you kidding? We are living in a world of chaos. Roommate agreement.\nPenny: Where are you going?\nSheldon: Wherever the music takes me, kitten. I play bongos walking down the stairs. (Sound of falling) Oh! Oh! Never play bongos walking down the stairs.\nScene: Howard\xe2\x80\x99s hotel room. There is a knock on the door.\nBernadette: Surprise.\nHoward: What are you doing here?\nBernadette: I\xe2\x80\x99m here to help you get through this. You can\xe2\x80\x99t do it on your own, you need someone to take care of you.\nHoward: Oh, I love you so much.\nBernadette: Oh, I love you.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Howard, your bath is getting cold!\nHoward: Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry, once she falls asleep, I\xe2\x80\x99ll spoon you like an armadillo.\nScene: Amy\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nAmy: He showed up in the middle of the night with his bongos. I foolishly thought it was some sort of musical booty call.\nLeonard: Poor guy. He must have been exhausted. Sheldon like to sleep while Leonard play the bongo!\nAmy: That was kind of uncalled for.\nLeonard: No, it was called for.\nSheldon: What\xe2\x80\x99s going on?\nPenny: All right, Sheldon, this craziness has gone on long enough. Please come home so I can cut your hair.\nSheldon: Penny, you\xe2\x80\x99re not trained. You\xe2\x80\x99re not licensed. Most importantly, you don\xe2\x80\x99t have access to my haircut records.\nPenny: All right, honey, look, we\xe2\x80\x99ve known each other for a long time now, right? I\xe2\x80\x99ve taken you to Disneyland, I kicked a bully in the nuts for you, I sing you Soft Kitty when you\xe2\x80\x99re sick, you\xe2\x80\x99ve even saw me naked once.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, duh, what?\nPenny: It was a long story. Anyway, Sheldon, I promise I know what I\xe2\x80\x99m doing. Please let me cut your hair.\nSheldon: Amy, what do you think?\nAmy: There\xe2\x80\x99s not a hair on my body I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t let this woman trim.\nSheldon: Fine, let\xe2\x80\x99s go. Thank you for letting me sleep on your couch.\nAmy: There\xe2\x80\x99s only so many times a woman can say how about the bed?\nLeonard: What\xe2\x80\x99s this about Sheldon seeing you naked?\nSheldon: Oh, relax. It was just her bottom and her breasts.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment. Penny is cutting Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s hair.\nPenny: Almost done.\nSheldon: At the end of the haircut, Mr. D\xe2\x80\x99Onofrio would tell me a dirty joke.\nPenny: Well, sorry, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know any dirty jokes.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s okay, I never understood them anyway.\nPenny: Okay, what do you think?\nSheldon: Hmm, well, it\xe2\x80\x99s a little Hollywood. But I think I can pull it off. Well done, Penny.\nPenny: Ha, told you. Okay, I\xe2\x80\x99m just gonna clean up your neck a little and then you are good to go.\nSheldon: Fun time. Hah. Sorry, sometimes the clippers tickle me.\nPenny: Okay. (Sheldon laughs and jerks, Penny accidentally shaves a strip up the back of his head) Okay, yep, we\xe2\x80\x99re all done now. It\xe2\x80\x99s just, it\xe2\x80\x99s good. Let me just take that away from you. Okay.\nSgeldon: Thank you very much.\nPenny: You are welcome. Yeah, I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna have to move.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
