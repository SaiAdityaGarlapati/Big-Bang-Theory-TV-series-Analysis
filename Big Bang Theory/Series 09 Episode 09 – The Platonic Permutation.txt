b'Scene: The apartment.\nRaj: Have you guys seen this feature that lets you talk to Siri without pressing any buttons?\nHoward: No. How does it work?\nRaj: You just say, uh, Hey, Siri, what time is it?\nSiri: The time is 6:37 p.m.\nHoward: So now anyone can control your phone? Hey, Siri, show me pictures of naked grandma butts.\nRaj: Nice try. It only recognizes my voice.\nHoward: Oh. Cool. (In thick Indian accent) Hey, Siri, show me pictures of naked grandma butts.\nRaj: I don\xe2\x80\x99t sound like that.\nSiri: Here are some images of naked grandma butts.\nSheldon: Hey. Good news, everybody. Now that I\xe2\x80\x99m no longer with Amy, I have an extra ticket to the annual Thanksgiving lunch buffet at the aquarium cafeteria. Who wants it? Well, you realize you won\xe2\x80\x99t be going alone, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be there the whole time. Providing fish and pilgrim facts. Can you people hear me?\nLeonard: Well, we\xe2\x80\x99re having everyone over.\nPenny: Yeah, Leonard and I are gonna be cooking all day.\nLeonard: Otherwise we\xe2\x80\x99d love to.\nPenny: But we can\xe2\x80\x99t.\nLeonard: Yeah, poor us.\nPenny: Mm-hmm.\nBernadette: And Raj and I are volunteering at the soup kitchen, feeding food to the homeless.\nSheldon: Well, Howard, what about you?\nHoward: Oh, I can\xe2\x80\x99t. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to the soup kitchen, too.\nBernadette: You said that sounded like the worst thing ever.\nHoward: If you can\xe2\x80\x99t support me when I\xe2\x80\x99m lying, why are we married?\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The apartment.\nAmy (on skype): Hi, Sheldon. What\xe2\x80\x99s up?\nSheldon: Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m calling because Thanksgiving is coming up, and I wanted to offer you the aquarium tickets.\nAmy: No one can go with you?\nSheldon: No. They\xe2\x80\x99d rather spend the holiday with each other than find out of this is the year I finally touch a starfish. Anyway, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want the tickets to go to waste, so take whomever you\xe2\x80\x99d like.\nAmy: Oh. Okay. Thank you.\nSheldon: And feel free to tell your guest that the Myanmar catfish is also known as the pilgrim fish. In case the turkey\xe2\x80\x99s dry and you need something juicy.\nAmy: Sheldon, I can tell you want to go, so if you\xe2\x80\x99d be comfortable with it, maybe we could go as friends.\nSheldon: You don\xe2\x80\x99t think that will be awkward?\nAmy: Well it is Thanksgiving in an aquarium cafeteria, so I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna go out on a limb here and say yes. But if you mean between us, I think it\xe2\x80\x99ll be fine.\nSheldon: Very well, then. I\xe2\x80\x99ll see you on Thanksgiving morning.\nAmy: See you then.\nSheldon: Oh, and forget what I said about the Myanmar catfish. My list of marine-themed pilgrim facts is pretty short.\nAmy: Did you know they served shellfish and eel at the very first Thanksgiving?\nSheldon: And there goes my list.\nScene: Outside the soup kitchen.\nEmily: So, how does this work?\nBernadette: The soup kitchen manager assigns the jobs, and the shifts are six hours.\nHoward: Six hours? Oh, God, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to complain for that long.\nRaj: Do you ever do anything for anyone else?\nHoward: I happen to be a giving and generous lover.\nEmily: Are you and I close enough for me to say that\xe2\x80\x99s creepy?\nBernadette: We are, and I believe the word you\xe2\x80\x99re looking for is yu-huh-huh-huh.\nSoup Kitchen Manager: Uh, can I help you?\nBernadette: Hi. We\xe2\x80\x99d like to volunteer.\nSoup Kitchen Manager: Oh, I appreciate you guys coming down, but we already have enough people. Any other day, please, come back.\nBernadette: Oh. Okay. Wipe that smug smile off your face.\nHoward: Maybe I\xe2\x80\x99m happy that so many people turned up to help the less fortunate.\nEmily: Are you and I close enough for me to say\xe2\x80\xa6\nBernadette: That he\xe2\x80\x99s an ass? He beat you to it.\nSoup Kitchen Manager: I was wrong. A large group had to cancel.\nBernadette: Oh, great. We\xe2\x80\x99d love to help.\nHoward: Wipe that smug smile off your face.\nBernadette: I can\xe2\x80\x99t.\nScene: The apartment.\nPenny: Look at us. Our first Thanksgiving as husband and wife.\nLeonard: I know. I feel so grown up.\nPenny: Sweetie, you are grown up.\nLeonard: Really? How many grown-ups do you know who have Mr. Spock oven mitts? Hey, the recipes are on my iPad. Will you pull \xe2\x80\x99em up?\nPenny: Yep. What\xe2\x80\x99s the code?\nLeonard: My birthday.\nPenny: It\xe2\x80\x99s not working.\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s just the four digits, month and day.\nPenny: Nope.\nLeonard: Let me see. Yeah, there. What number were you putting in?\nPenny: Uh.\nLeonard: You don\xe2\x80\x99t know my birthday, do you?\nPenny: Yes, I do.\nLeonard: Well, what is it?\nPenny: May.\nLeonard: May what?\nPenny: I\xe2\x80\x99m not gonna say your password out loud. That is not secure.\nLeonard: You don\xe2\x80\x99t know your own husband\xe2\x80\x99s birthday.\nPenny: Well, you don\xe2\x80\x99t know everything about me.\nLeonard: Your birthday is December 2, you grew up on Perkins Street, the last four digits of your social are 7 6-2 1, and the odds of me letting you forget this are zero.\nPenny: Oh, look at us. Our last Thanksgiving as husband and wife.\nScene: Amy\xe2\x80\x99s car.\nSheldon: Hello.\nAmy: Hi. Ready for the aquarium?\nSheldon: I am. You know, and in an effort to reduce awkwardness as we learn how to function as friends, I printed out a list of safe topics for polite conversation.\nAmy: If that makes you more comfortable.\nSheldon: If there were a list of things that make me more comfortable, lists would be on the top of that list. Okay, now, oh, since last we spoke, have you acquired any pets?\nAmy: No. You?\nSheldon: No. Um, since last we spoke, have you planned or gone on any vacations?\nAmy: I might go visit my aunt next week.\nSheldon: Mm. Your aunt in Modesto?\nAmy: No, the one in Bakersfield.\nSheldon: Bakersfield. I see. Where has this list been all my life?\nScene: The soup kitchen.\nSoup Kitchen Manager: We\xe2\x80\x99re gonna have you washing dishes. Uh, aprons and rubber gloves are here, just scrape, wash and stack. If you need me, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be around.\nHoward: So we don\xe2\x80\x99t even get to be up front where the action is?\nBernadette: What difference does it make?\nHoward: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I was hoping some poor kid would come up to me and say, please, sir, I want some more.\nRaj: You\xe2\x80\x99re in a soup kitchen, not a production of Oliver!\nHoward: It\xe2\x80\x99s not like I\xe2\x80\x99m expecting them to sing.\nScene: Amy\xe2\x80\x99s car.\nSheldon: and then the next day was 73 degrees, and the day after that was 72, and then it was 72 again, uh, then it was 74, and that brings us to today, at I\xe2\x80\x99d wear shorts if I had a pair. 78.\nAmy: Are we done discussing the weather?\nSheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if I\xe2\x80\x99d call it discussing. You kind of sat back and let me do all the work. Let\xe2\x80\x99s see, what\xe2\x80\x99s next on the list. Oh, uh, do you whittle, and if so, what kind of knife do you use.\nAmy: Sheldon. We\xe2\x80\x99ve known each other a long time. We are perfectly capable of having a conversation without relying on a list off the Internet.\nSheldon: All right. Well, what should we talk about?\nAmy: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Just ask me whatever comes to mind.\nSheldon: Very well. I know you\xe2\x80\x99ve been seeing other men. Have you had coitus with any of them?\nAmy: Man, I walked right into that one.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: Next we need a teaspoon of pepper, which, I believe, was also the name of your childhood dog.\nPenny: Fine. You think you know so much. Who\xe2\x80\x99s my favourite Spice Girl?\nLeonard: Baby.\nPenny: Who\xe2\x80\x99s my favorite member of NSYNC?\nLeonard: Justin.\nPenny: Who\xe2\x80\x99s my favorite Backstreet Boy?\nLeonard: Nice try. NSYNC forever.\nPenny: Damn it.\nLeonard: Face it, you can\xe2\x80\x99t stump me. I am the king of husbands. I know that you don\xe2\x80\x99t like the lingerie that I got you on Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s Day. I know you hate the word moist. I know\xe2\x80\xa6\nPenny: Hang on. Wait, wait. Why don\xe2\x80\x99t I like the lingerie you got me?\nLeonard: Because it\xe2\x80\x99s orange and you think it makes you look like a slutty carrot.\nPenny: Interesting. I never told you that.\nLeonard: Sure you did.\nPenny: No. I never told anyone that. But I did write it in my journal.\nLeonard: What? I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know you had a journal.\nPenny: I also know your voice gets higher when you\xe2\x80\x99re lying.\nLeonard: No, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t.\nScene: The soup kitchen.\nRaj: You know, this reminds me of high school.\nEmily: You worked in a restaurant?\nRaj: No, I was in India, it was humid and smelled funny.\nHoward: All right, I think I\xe2\x80\x99m getting into a groove here. This isn\xe2\x80\x99t so bad.\nEmly: Only five hours and 40 minutes to go.\nHoward: We\xe2\x80\x99ve only been doing this 20 minutes?\nRaj: You know, I read that washing dishes can be an excellent form of meditation. The key is that while washing the dishes one should only be washing the dishes.\nHoward: Just because you have that accent doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean what you say isn\xe2\x80\x99t stupid.\nRaj: No, seriously. It\xe2\x80\x99s about being present in the moment, focusing on the feeling of the warm water, the smell of the detergent, the sound of the dishes squeaking, and following your own breath. It\xe2\x80\x99s about, it\xe2\x80\x99s about simply being.\nHoward: Huh. Okay, I\xe2\x80\x99ll try it.\nSoup Kitchen Manager: I need three people out front.\nBernadette: I\xe2\x80\x99ll do it.\nRaj: Me.\nEmily: Right here!\nHoward: No fair, I was meditating.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: Come on, don\xe2\x80\x99t be mad. It was a long time ago, and it was an accident.\nPenny: How can reading my journal be an accident?\nLeonard: I didn\xe2\x80\x99t even know what it was. I saw it on your nightstand. I picked it up.\nPenny: Well, when you realized what it was, why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you stop?\nLeonard: You know me, I\xe2\x80\x99m a big ol\xe2\x80\x99 bookworm.\nPenny: All right. Let\xe2\x80\x99s just finish cooking.\nLeonard: Well, hey, okay. Let me make this up to you. Sometimes I keep an online journal. I want you to read something that I wrote.\nPenny: Okay, really, I\xe2\x80\x99m fine.\nLeonard: Okay. Well, then I\xe2\x80\x99ll read it to you. It\xe2\x80\x99s from the day we first met. Beauty, thy name is Penny.\nPenny: Oh, God. Stop. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want you to read something you think\xe2\x80\x99ll just butter me up. I want to hear the most recent thing you wrote.\nLeonard: Fine. Mmm, Penny\xe2\x80\x99s beauty, like our love, grows more with each passing day.\xe2\x80\x9d\nPenny: Does it really say that?\nLeonard: Why would I lie?\nPenny: OMG. OMG. We\xe2\x80\x99re so close to the new Star Wars. I can\xe2\x80\x99t take it. Gah. Gah?\nLeonard: Well, you didn\xe2\x80\x99t read it right. The new Star Wars is coming. Gah.\nScene: Amy\xe2\x80\x99s car.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m sensing things have gotten awkward.\nAmy: No. It\xe2\x80\x99s okay. If we\xe2\x80\x99re friends, we should be able to talk about anything.\nSheldon: All right.\nAmy: So, you had some questions about me seeing other people.\nSheldon: Just a few.\nAmy: Go ahead.\nSheldon: How many dates have you been on? Who were they with? Where\xe2\x80\x99d you go? Where did you meet them? Did you sleep with them? And how much longer to the aquarium? I\xe2\x80\x99m getting kind of hungry.\nAmy: Let\xe2\x80\x99s see. I have been on six dates with three different people. It was either for coffee or dinner. One I met at a bookstore and two I met online. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t slept with anyone. The aquarium is 40 minutes away. And there\xe2\x80\x99s a baggie of Cheerios for you in the glove compartment.\nSheldon: Is that regular or honey nut?\nAmy: I mixed them.\nSheldon: You mixed them. No wonder gentleman callers are pounding down your door. Do you have any questions for me?\nAmy: Just one. Are you doing okay?\nSheldon: I am.\nAmy: Good. I want you to be happy.\nSheldon: I believe you. I\xe2\x80\x99d believe you more if you threw a few Apple Jacks in here.\nScene: The soup kitchen.\nMan: Here you go.\nHoward: Thanks. You got to be kidding me.\nMan: Sorry?\nHoward: Y, you\xe2\x80\x99re Elon Musk.\nElon: I am.\nHoward: Wh, what are you doing here?\nElon: I\xe2\x80\x99m washing dishes. Well, I was on the turkey line, but I got demoted for being too generous with the gravy.\nHoward: Oh, man. I, what an honour to meet you. I\xe2\x80\x99m, I\xe2\x80\x99m such a fan of Tesla and SpaceX. All your companies. Howard Wolowitz, Caltech.\nElon: Nice to meet you, Howard. Feels great to come down here and help the less fortunate, huh?\nHoward: Oh, yeah. Nothing better than helping people. Which is something I realized when I was viewing Earth from the deck of the International Space Station, where I spent two months as a payload specialist, a job I was qualified for because I\xe2\x80\x99m an MIT-trained engineer.\nElon: And I thought I ladled the gravy on thick.\nHoward: Sorry. It\xe2\x80\x99s just, you\xe2\x80\x99re you, you know? And I really want you to adopt me.\nElon: Well, you\xe2\x80\x99re here on Thanksgiving, so you\xe2\x80\x99re probably a good person.\nHoward: Oh. I made my wife come down, too.\nElon: You think you might ever get back out to space?\nHoward: Is that a job offer? \xe2\x80\x98Cause I really want to go to Mars. Assuming I can bring my wife. She hardly takes up any room. She\xe2\x80\x99s basically a carry-on.\nElon: Well, we\xe2\x80\x99re not quite there yet, but we\xe2\x80\x99re always looking for engineers. So let me give you my e-mail. We can stay in touch.\nHoward: Thank you.\nElon: Oh, look. Someone hardly touched their pumpkin pie. Want to share it with me?\nHoward: A partially eaten piece of pumpkin pie from a homeless shelter? With Elon Musk, you bet I do.\nScene: The aquarium.\nSheldon: You know, for a Thanksgiving buffet in an aquarium cafeteria, that was really bad.\nAmy: You\xe2\x80\x99re just upset \xe2\x80\x99cause they ran out of Pilgrim hats.\nSheldon: They gave one to that baby. He wasn\xe2\x80\x99t even awake.\nAmy: Well, it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be a holiday without you being mad at a baby.\nSheldon: Oh. Would you care to play an ocean-themed game I invented?\nAmy: Sure. What is it?\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s called Food, Friend, Fight. One of us chooses three aquatic creatures, and the other one must decide which he would eat, befriend, or battle.\nAmy: So it\xe2\x80\x99s like Kiss, Marry, Kill.\nSheldon: What is that?\nAmy: It\xe2\x80\x99s a game where you\xe2\x80\x99re given three people and you choose which one you\xe2\x80\x99d kiss, marry, or kill.\nSheldon: Well, my game is better, \xe2\x80\x99cause instead of marrying someone, you get to eat them.\nAmy: Let\xe2\x80\x99s just play.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99ll start you off easy. Electric eel, pufferfish, shrimp.\nAmy: Hmm. Well, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t fight the eel, because I know it can generate enough current to kill a horse. So I\xe2\x80\x99d eat the eel, fight the shrimp, and befriend the pufferfish, because it would be nice to have company on those days I feel bloated.\nSheldon: Very well done.\nAmy: Thank you. Okay, your turn. Hmm. Seal, hagfish, SpongeBob SquarePants.\nSheldon: Well, I\xe2\x80\x99d befriend SpongeBob but he\xe2\x80\x99s not real, so I can\xe2\x80\x99t do that, can I?\nAmy: But you can pal around with a hagfish?\nSheldon: Hey, let\xe2\x80\x99s not pull at that thread. Okay. I\xe2\x80\x99ll fight SpongeBob, because he\xe2\x80\x99s so friendly we\xe2\x80\x99ll just end up tickling each other. Um, I\xe2\x80\x99ll befriend the seal, because he\xe2\x80\x99s trainable, which is the problem I\xe2\x80\x99m having with my current friends. Which means I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to eat the hagfish.\nAmy: Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that gross? I mean, a hagfish can produce enough mucus to fill a bucket in a minute.\nSheldon: I know. It makes its own gravy, it\xe2\x80\x99ll slide right down.\nAmy: I miss this.\nSheldon: How can you miss a game you\xe2\x80\x99ve never played before, silly?\nAmy: I guess sometimes I\xe2\x80\x99m silly.\nScene: The apartment.\nPenny: Hey. Where\xe2\x80\x99d you go? I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell if the turkey\xe2\x80\x99s done.\nLeonard: Be right there. Hi, lover.\nPenny: What are you doing?\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry about the journal. I want to make it up to you. So I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna let you post a shame photo of me on Facebook.\nPenny: I am not putting that on the Internet. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want people to see this. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to see it.\nLeonard: Don\xe2\x80\x99t want people to see what, huh? A little bit of this?\nPenny: Oh.\nLeonard: Huh? Some of this? And, since it\xe2\x80\x99s Thanksgiving, an extra helping of this?\nBernadette: Happy Thanks\xe2\x80\xa6 Yikes.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m glad you had a nice time with Amy.\nSheldon: Me, too. It\xe2\x80\x99s comforting to know that she and I are able to function as friends.\nPenny: Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ve never been friends with any of my exes.\nSheldon: Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you and Leonard will be able to pull it off. (Phone rings) Oh. It\xe2\x80\x99s my friend Amy. Hello.\nAmy: Hi, Sheldon. I\xe2\x80\x99m just driving home from my mother\xe2\x80\x99s.\nSheldon: Did you have a nice time?\nAmy: I did. Um, listen, I really enjoyed spending this morning with you.\nSheldon: Well, I can\xe2\x80\x99t take all the credit. It was pretty funny when that one anchovy started going the wrong way.\nAmy: It was. Uh, listen, I, I was thinking that, um, maybe I\xe2\x80\x99m ready to be your girlfriend again.\nSheldon: Oh. I thought we were just friends.\nAmy: We are. But I was hoping, maybe\xe2\x80\xa6\nSheldon: Amy, I excel at many things, but getting over you wasn\xe2\x80\x99t one of them. I think I need to just be your friend.\nAmy: Okay. I understand.\nSheldon: Good. Oh, I watched a video of the hagfish producing mucus, so I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna change my answer and eat SpongeBob.\nAmy: Okay. Sure.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
