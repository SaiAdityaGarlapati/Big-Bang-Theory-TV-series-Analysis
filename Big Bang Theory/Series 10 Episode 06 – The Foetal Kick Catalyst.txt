b'Scene: The apartment.\nPenny: Hey, have you ever heard of the Van Nuys Comic-Con?\nLeonard: \xe2\x80\xadYeah. It\xe2\x80\x99s a dinky little convention where they sell collectibles and get sad D-list celebrities to appear. Why?\nPenny: I got asked to sign autographs there.\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99s awesome. Is this for Serial Ape-ist?\nPenny: Well, it could be for the monkey movie. It could be my haemorrhoid commercial. The list does not go on.\nLeonard: When is it?\nPenny: It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter. I\xe2\x80\x99m not doing it.\nLeonard: What? Why not?\nPenny: You just said yourself, it\xe2\x80\x99s sad.\nLeonard: Yeah, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not pathetic, that\xe2\x80\x99s where I draw the line. Come on, we\xe2\x80\x99ll have fun.\nPenny: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\nLeonard: You\xe2\x80\x99ll have nerds fawning all over you. If you don\xe2\x80\x99t love that, this marriage is in trouble.\nPenny: I guess it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t hurt to meet some fans and make a little extra money.\nLeonard: Yeah. Wow, An appearance by George Lucas\xe2\x80\xa6 \xe2\x80\x98s dermatologist. Oh, I want that autograph.\nPenny: Oh, yeah.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: Sheldon and Amy\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nAmy: You know, with us living together, maybe we could think about having people over.\nSheldon: We have people over all the time. We have the maintenance people, the pizza delivery man, that UPS driver who feels the need to ask how parts of me are hanging.\nAmy: You know what I meant.\nSheldon: All right, fine. Let\xe2\x80\x99s say that we were to entertain people. What type of gathering did you have in mind? Huh? A meal? Lunch? Brunch? Dinner? Afternoon tea? A formal tea? Hmm? Is it a party? And if so, what kind of party? Is it a cocktail party? A Tupperware party? Ooh, is it a surprise party? Oh, I hope it\xe2\x80\x99s not a West Coast party, \xe2\x80\x99cause according to the man on the radio, a West Coast party don\xe2\x80\x99t stop.\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry I mentioned it.\nSheldon: Oh, don\xe2\x80\x99t be. You get your hopes up, I knock them down. That\xe2\x80\x99s called teamwork.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom.\nHoward: That\xe2\x80\x99s a kick. That\xe2\x80\x99s an actual kick.\nBernadette: What are you doing?\nHoward: I felt a kick. There\xe2\x80\x99s a baby in there.\nBernadette: Oh, yeah, that\xe2\x80\x99s where I put it.\nHoward: Oh, I mean, I know you\xe2\x80\x99re pregnant. I just never connected the idea of pregnancy and you actually having a baby.\nBernadette: Which MIT did you go to?\nHoward: Oh, God, we are not ready to have an infant in this house. We don\xe2\x80\x99t have a crib, we don\xe2\x80\x99t have diapers, we\xe2\x80\x99re not baby-proofed. Anyone can just walk in off the street and lift our toilet lids!\nBernadette: Howie, we have time to do all that stuff.\nHoward: Do we? Look at you. Willy Wonka would roll you to the juicing room.\nBernadette: The next person kicking you will be me. Good night.\nHoward: Are we even in a good school\xe2\x80\xa6? Ow!\nBernadette: I warned you, and I did it.\nScene: The apartment.\nPenny: What\xe2\x80\x99s all this?\nLeonard: Oh, everything we need for your autograph session, head shots, markers.\nPenny: Okay. Leonard, it\xe2\x80\x99s sweet you\xe2\x80\x99re excited about this, but it\xe2\x80\x99ll be a miracle if one person asks for my autograph.\nLeonard: Are you kidding? I once paid twenty dollars for Theo Sassler\xe2\x80\x99s signature.\nPenny: Who\xe2\x80\x99s that?\nLeonard: Oh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t even know. I just liked his name. Theo Sassler. Okay, and look at this. I even got a change maker. How much change you want, little lady?\nPenny: Oh, there\xe2\x80\x99s so much I want to change.\nLeonard: Yeah, well, if it\xe2\x80\x99s a dollar, you\xe2\x80\x99re in luck.\nScene: Sheldon and Amy\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nAmy: What\xe2\x80\x99s going on here?\nSheldon: You expressed an interest in having people over, and I feel I dismissed it too quickly. So, I took matters into my own hands, and I arranged a brunch.\nAmy: Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s so nice. Who\xe2\x80\x99s coming?\nSheldon: Oh, uh, Stuart, Bert from the geology lab, and Mrs. Petrescu from downstairs.\nAmy: You mean the Romanian lady on the second floor?\nSheldon: Yes. Oh, fun story, she grew up with ten siblings. Or possibly penguins. Her English is atrocious.\nAmy: That\xe2\x80\x99s an odd mix of people.\nSheldon: Well, for our first time hosting, I thought it would be wise to conduct a trial run. You know, like how I practiced for that Halloween haunted house by going into the bathroom at the bus station.\nAmy: You never went into that haunted house.\nSheldon: You never saw what jumped out at me at the bus station.\nAmy: Well, thank you, Sheldon. This is a fun surprise.\nSheldon: Oh. Well, the real surprise is how surprised you are that I\xe2\x80\x99m great at surprises.\nAmy: Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s not a surprise at all. I mean, if I knew you were good at surprises, I would have\nexpected the surprise, and therefore not have been surprised, but as it is, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know, and therefore my surprise should be unsurprising.\nSheldon: Don\xe2\x80\x99t get me all randy. Guests are on the way.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s kitchen.\nHoward: Hi.\nBernadette: Hey, where you been?\nHoward: Oh, we went and did a little shopping for the baby.\nRaj: Wait till you see the crib we found.\nBernadette: You bought a crib without me?\nHoward: You\xe2\x80\x99re gonna love it.\nRaj: Yeah, it\xe2\x80\x99s the highest rated one on the market. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t even call it a crib, I\xe2\x80\x99d call it a Fortress of Solitude for babies.\nBernadette: Sounds expensive.\nHoward: Okay, well, I may have gone a bit overboard, but you can\xe2\x80\x99t put a price on safety.\nRaj: Though if you did, it\xe2\x80\x99s more zeroes than you\xe2\x80\x99re expecting.\nHoward: But it\xe2\x80\x99s the safest crib you can buy. And if you don\xe2\x80\x99t like it, we can return it.\nBernadette: Fine.\nHoward: In our new minivan. Hey, what\xe2\x80\x99s for lunch?\nBernadette: You bought a minivan?\nHoward: It\xe2\x80\x99s for the baby, and I didn\xe2\x80\x99t buy it. The dealer loaned it to me for a 24-hour test drive.\nRaj: Though we did ding up the back pretty good with the crib, so you might have bought a minivan.\nBernadette: I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to drive that. It\xe2\x80\x99s such a mom car.\nHoward: The guy at the dealership said they\xe2\x80\x99re not just for moms anymore.\nRaj: Then again, he did think you were my husband.\nBernadette: They thought it at the ultrasound, why not at the car dealership?\nScene: The Comic-con.\nLeonard: Never been on this side of the table before. I feel powerful.\nPenny: Really? I feel like I\xe2\x80\x99m selling candy so our team can get new uniforms.\nLeonard: Okay, so it\xe2\x80\x99s four seventy-five for a signed black-and-white and nine ninety-five for a colour.\nPenny: Alright, why not five and ten bucks?\nLeonard: Well, I brought my moneymaker. Let me shake it.\nPenny: Hey, that guy\xe2\x80\x99s looking over here.\nLeonard: Oh. You think he\xe2\x80\x99s your first autograph?\nPenny: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Be cool. He\xe2\x80\x99s coming. He\xe2\x80\x99s coming. Hi.\nGuy: Hi. I love your movie.\nPenny: Well, thanks.\nGuy: It has got to be one of the worst things I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever seen in my life.\nPenny: Your love confuses me.\nLeonard: Would you like an autograph?\nGuy: Sure.\nPenny: Okay. Who do I make it out to?\nGuy: Daniel.\nPenny: Okay.\nDaniel: I have to ask. Were you trying to be that bad, or are you just a terrible actress?\nPenny: That did not clear things up.\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99ll be four seventy-five.\nDaniel: Keep the change.\nLeonard: But I-I-I, oh. Nothing about that was good.\nScene: Sheldon and Amy\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nAmy: There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to be afraid of, Sheldon.\nSheldon: The average cork speed is 25 miles per hour. If that is too fast around a school, it is certainly too fast around a kitchen.\nAmy: Been 15 minutes. Just sayin\xe2\x80\x99.\nSheldon: Okay. I can do this. Just give me a moment\xe2\x80\xa6 Oh! Mimosas coming up.\nBert: I once left orange juice in my fridge so long, it tasted like a mimosa.\nAmy: How old was it\nBert: It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to say. I don\xe2\x80\x99t remember much after I drank it.\nSheldon: Would you like one, Mrs. Petrescu?\nMrs Petrescu: Yes. Drink is fun and good friends, Applebee\xe2\x80\x99s.\nSheldon: She\xe2\x80\x99s learning English from TV.\nMrs Petrescu: TV, good. Now back to you.\nStuart: Hey, guys.\nAmy: Hi, Stuart.\nStuart: These are for you.\nAmy: Oh, they\xe2\x80\x99re pretty. Thank you.\nSheldon: Stuart, this is Bert from the Caltech geology lab, and this is Mrs. Petrescu from downstairs.\nStuart: Nice to meet you.\nMrs Petrescu: Hello.\nBert: Hey.\nStuart: So, what did I miss?\nBert: Eh, we watched Sheldon try to open a bottle for 15 minutes.\nMrs Petrescu: 15 minutes can save you 15% or more on car insurance.\nStuart: Anybody else coming to this thing?\nScene: The Comic-con.\nPenny: What\xe2\x80\x99s your name?\nJeff: Jeff.\nPenny: Okay.\nJeff: My favourite part is your shower scene.\nPenny: Been hearing that a lot today.\nJeff: I even have a screen grab on my phone.\nPenny: Yep, there they are.\nLeonard: Okay, let\xe2\x80\x99s keep it moving.\nPenny: Here you go.\nLeonard: Should\xe2\x80\x99ve punched that guy.\nPenny: Well, go ahead. He\xe2\x80\x99s right over there.\nLeonard: Why do you do that? Can\xe2\x80\x99t you let me have my moment?\nPenny: Hello.\nAwkward guy: Hi. I like your movies.\nPenny: Thank you.\nAwkward guy: I saw both of them.\nPenny: I assume we\xe2\x80\x99re still talking about the movies, but after today, who knows.\nAwkward guy: You think I could get a picture of us?\nPenny: Oh, sure.\nAwkward guy: And, uh, could you be giving me a kiss?\nLeonard: No. She cannot kiss. What is wrong with you people?\nPenny: Leonard\xe2\x80\xa6\nLeonard: No, no, no. It\xe2\x80\x99s not okay.\nAwkward guy: Who are you?\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m her husband.\nAwkward guy: No, you\xe2\x80\x99re not.\nLeonard: I am.\nPenny: Yeah, he really is.\nAwkward guy: No.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s garage.\nHoward: It\xe2\x80\x99s got a rearview camera, there\xe2\x80\x99s a DVD player, oh, and check this out. It\xe2\x80\x99s like we\xe2\x80\x99re living in the future.\nRaj: Hey, show her the trunk. Show her the trunk.\nHoward: Imagine this, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got the baby in one hand, groceries in the other, and you\xe2\x80\x99re thinking, how am I gonna open this trunk?\nBernadette: I\xe2\x80\x99m probably thinking, where\xe2\x80\x99s my husband, and why isn\xe2\x80\x99t he helping me?\nHoward: You don\xe2\x80\x99t need my help when you can open the trunk with a simple kick of the foot.\nRaj: No, it\xe2\x80\x99s a gentle kick, you\xe2\x80\x99re doing it wrong. Here. Give me those.\nHoward: Uh, maybe it was more of a circle?\nBernadette: It\xe2\x80\x99s weird that guy thought you were a couple.\nHoward: Yes.\nRaj: Yes.\nHoward: See? Easy. And look at all this cargo space. Now we\xe2\x80\x99ll get the crib out and you can take it for a test-drive. I\xe2\x80\x99m telling you, this van is gonna be\xe2\x80\xa6 uuh-uuh, uuh-uuh.\nBernadette: Oh, is it your back?\nHoward: Oh, yeah, oh, anyway, let\xe2\x80\x99s just get in and see if the GPS can take us to the nearest emergency room.\nScene: Sheldon and Amy\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nSheldon: So until Amy\xe2\x80\x99s apartment is fixed, she and I are living here together.\nBert: I lived with my old girlfriend. She was a geologist, too.\nAmy: Things didn\xe2\x80\x99t work out?\nBert: I came home from work one day and she had taken everything. I\xe2\x80\x99m warning you, hide your good rocks.\nMrs Petrescu: My sister\xe2\x80\x99s husband took all her things, too. Story at eleven.\nStuart: Really, no one else is coming?\nSheldon: This is it. You are the practice round.\nStuart: Practice round? For-for what?\nAmy: Uh, no. He, he just means that you were the first people we thought of.\nSheldon: You know, exactly. We\xe2\x80\x99ve never thrown a brunch before, and I wanted to work out all the kinks.\nStuart: So, I\xe2\x80\x99m like a lab rat before your real friends come over?\nSheldon: Hmm. You see, your words sound reasonable, but your face looks angry. Help me out here, this is not where I shine.\nAmy: Stuart, you know you\xe2\x80\x99re one of our favourite people.\nSheldon: Okay, now, see, you look sincere, but your words are completely false. I\xe2\x80\x99m glad we did this test run, these brunches are wild.\nScene: The Comic-con.\nAwkward guy: But how did you get her to go out with you?\nLeonard: Well, she moved in across the hall.\nPenny: And he started to slowly wear me down.\nLeonard: Like a river carves a canyon.\nPenny: Yeah, except the river kept showing me his Pok\xc3\xa9mon cards.\nRed-haired guy: Ready to go?\nAwkward guy: Hang on. This guy\xe2\x80\x99s telling me how he got the Serial Ape-ist girl to marry him.\nRed-haired guy: This guy? But he\xe2\x80\x99s wearing a change maker.\nPenny: I think it\xe2\x80\x99s hot.\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99s right. I\xe2\x80\x99m her change daddy.\nScene: The minivan.\nHoward: Aaaaah. What was I thinking? Wolowitzes are not a lifting people. We tip the lifting people.\nBernadette: Do we really have to sit for hours in the emergency room? They\xe2\x80\x99re just gonna give you ice and Advil like last time.\nHoward: You\xe2\x80\x99re gonna feel terrible when I\xe2\x80\x99m in a wheelchair. Which, by the way, would fit easily in the back of this award-winning minivan.\nBernadette: Fine, we\xe2\x80\x99ll go to the E.R. Just stop selling me on the van.\nHoward: You\xe2\x80\x99re right. It sells itself.\nRaj: You have to admit, it\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty smooth ride.\nBernadette: I was hoping it\xe2\x80\x99d be quieter.\nHoward: If childbirth is half this bad, you are so screwed. Are we there yet?\nBernadette: Soon.\nHoward: Why is it taking so long?\nRaj: Howard, Howard, look at the DVD screen. I put on Batman: The Animated Series. Your favourite.\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m in too much pain to watch cartoo\xe2\x80\xa6 oh, this is a good one.\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99ve been babysitting him way longer than you have.\nBernadette: Fine. I\xe2\x80\x99ll buy the stupid van.\nScene: Sheldon and Amy\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nBert: This is the best blintz I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever had.\nSheldon: Oh. Thank you.\nBert: It almost makes up for the incredibly awkward turn things took earlier.\nStuart: You know what, I, I, I think I\xe2\x80\x99m just gonna go.\nAmy: No, Stuart, don\xe2\x80\x99t.\nStuart: No, I consider you and Sheldon like my family, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not even sure you think of me as a friend. You have any idea how that feels?\nAmy: We\xe2\x80\x99re so sorry.\nStuart: I\xe2\x80\x99m always the last one anybody thinks of.\nSheldon: Well, no, that\xe2\x80\x99s not true. I mean, sometimes it\xe2\x80\x99s Koothrappali. But we\xe2\x80\x99re not supposed to say that \xe2\x80\x99cause he\xe2\x80\x99s a minority.\nStuart: Bye.\nSheldon: Stuart, wait. I do know what it feels like to be left out.\nBert: I know how it feels, too.\nSheldon: All right, this is about me and him, you\xe2\x80\x99re not part of it. Stuart, perhaps we do take you for granted, and that is not acceptable. Please know that you truly are a valuable member of our social group.\nStuart: Thank you.\nSheldon: You know, in fact, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to propose a toast. To Stuart. A fine man, a good friend and a wonderful guest.\nBert: Hear, hear.\nAmy: Cheers.\nMrs Petrescu: Cheers. Filmed before a live studio audience.\nScene: The Comic-con.\nLeonard: And that is how a short asthmatic scientist landed a stone cold fox.\nAwkward guy: Oh. Whoa. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know you can propose to the same person so many times.\nLeonard: The third time I did it in skywriting, but she never looked up.\nPenny: You know, once, I proposed to him.\nLeonard: Yeah. I said no.\nRed-haired guy: Why?\nLeonard: I just wanted to make her work for it.\nPenny: Yeah, that\xe2\x80\x99s gonna cost you later.\nRed-haired guy: Hang on. Is she just with you because you\xe2\x80\x99re rich?\nLeonard: She makes more money than I do.\nAwkward guy: What? Who are you?\nScene: Sheldon and Amy\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nSheldon: Do you know what else I love about you?\nStuart: Hmm?\nSheldon: Your handwriting is impeccable.\nStuart: Thank you for noticing.\nSheldon: No, I mean it. I mean it. It\xe2\x80\x99s like you have the soul of a label maker.\nStuart: You know what I love about you?\nSheldon: Hmm?\nStuart: You never leave the house without a paper clip.\nSheldon: You never know when two pieces of paper might temporarily need fastening in the top left corner.\nStuart: I also love how you never use swear words.\nSheldon: You know, it turns out, you can hurt people just as well without \xe2\x80\x99em.\nAmy: Maybe I can get a little help putting some of this stuff away.\nSheldon: Oh, calm down. I already put away five of these. You see? No muss, no fuss, not a single cuss.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
