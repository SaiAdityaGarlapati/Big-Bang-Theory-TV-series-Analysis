b'Scene: The apartment.\nSheldon: So what\xe2\x80\x99d you think?\nAmy: It was good.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s it? Good\xe2\x80\x9d\nAmy: I enjoyed it. When you told me I was going to be losing my virginity, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t think you meant showing me Raiders of the Lost Ark for the first time.\nSheldon: My apologies. I chose my words poorly. I should have said you were about to have your world rocked on my couch. Anyway, thank you for watching it. It\xe2\x80\x99s one of my all-time favourites.\nAmy: It was very entertaining despite the glaring story problem.\nSheldon: Story problem? You, oh, Amy, what a dewy-eyed moon-calf you are. Raiders of the Lost Ark is the love child of Steven Spielberg and George Lucas, two of the most gifted filmmakers of our generation. I\xe2\x80\x99ve watched it 36 times, except for the snake scene and the face-melting scene, which I can only watch when it\xe2\x80\x99s still light out, but, I defy you to find a story problem. Here\xe2\x80\x99s my jaw, drop it.\nAmy: All right. Indiana Jones plays no role in the outcome of the story. If he weren\xe2\x80\x99t in the film, it would turn out exactly the same.\nSheldon: Oh, I see your confusion. You don\xe2\x80\x99t understand. Indiana Jones was the one in the hat with the whip.\nAmy: No, I do, and if he weren\xe2\x80\x99t in the movie, the Nazis would have still found the ark, taken it to the island, opened it up and all died, just like they did. Let me close that for ya.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The foyer.\nLeonard: Hey.\nPenny: Hi. I thought you went to the comic book store on Wednesdays.\nLeonard: Yeah, but Sheldon and Amy were having date night and they don\xe2\x80\x99t need me there to make it awkward. They have each other for that. So, how was school?\nPenny: Oh, good. Check it out, The Disappointing Child by Beverly Hofstadter.\nLeonard: You bought my mom\xe2\x80\x99s book?\nPenny: Yeah. It\xe2\x80\x99s on the recommended reading list for my psychology class.\nLeonard: Oh, come on. Not that book. It, it\xe2\x80\x99s got, like, every horrible story from my childhood in it.\nPenny: Oh, cool. Are there pictures?\nLeonard: Seriously, please find another book.\nPenny: Oh, come on. Why? How bad could it be?\nLeonard: There, there\xe2\x80\x99s chapters about potty training, and bed-wetting and masturbation. Basically, if something came out of me, she wrote about it. You know what? Do whatever you want, just don\xe2\x80\x99t talk to me about it.\nPenny: Not even the chapter on the breast-feeding crisis?\nLeonard: It was not a crisis. Apparently, I favoured the left one, she got a little lopsided.\nPenny: Oh, my God, you still go left.\nScene: The cafeteria.\nRaj: Which celebrity would you say I look like the most?\nHoward: Halle Berry. Why?\nRaj: Stuart and I are putting dating profiles online, and it\xe2\x80\x99s one of the questions. And thank you, I\xe2\x80\x99d kill for that woman\xe2\x80\x99s bone structure.\nLeonard: Why are you reading Pride and Prejudice?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you why. Amy ruined Raiders of the Lost Ark for me, so now I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to find something beloved to her and ruin that.\nHoward: Because her life wasn\xe2\x80\x99t enough?\nRaj: Wait, how can, how can anyone ruin Raiders? It\xe2\x80\x99s perfect.\nSheldon: Yeah, except for the fact that Indiana Jones is completely irrelevant to the story. With or without him, the Nazis find the ark, open it and die.\nAll: Aw!\nHoward: Hey, wait a minute. No, the Nazis were digging in the wrong place. The only reason they got the ark was because Indy found it first.\nLeonard: Actually, they were only digging in the wrong place because Indy had the medallion. Without him, they would have had the medallion and dug in the right place.\nAll: Aw!\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nPenny: Okay, I know you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to talk about it, but can I just ask you one question about your mom\xe2\x80\x99s book?\nLeonard: No.\nPenny: I just want to know why a five-year-old boy puts on his mom\xe2\x80\x99s make-up and wears balloon boobies.\nLeonard: They weren\xe2\x80\x99t boobies, they were muscles. And the make-up was green. I was pretending to be The Hulk.\nPenny: You were wearing her bra.\nLeonard: That was to keep my muscles from sagging. Can we please stop talking about this?\nPenny: Okay, okay. But you know, as a student of psychology who got a check-plus on her first homework assignment, I think, sometimes, it\xe2\x80\x99s good to open up about these things.\nLeonard: Okay, fine. Do you want to know why I dressed like The Hulk? Because I was always mad at my mom and I wanted to smash my way out of that house.\nPenny: Well, why were you so angry?\nLeonard: Gee, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s because I was always the subject of her little experiments. Did you get to the chapter where she staged the Easter egg hunt with no eggs to see how long I\xe2\x80\x99d keep looking? The answer, by the way, June.\nPenny: Sweetie, I\xe2\x80\x99m so sorry. I wish there was something I could do to make you feel better.\nLeonard: I do, too, but there\xe2\x80\x99s not.\nPenny: Really? Are you sure about that?\nLeonard: Of course, who am I to argue with a check-plus student? Just warning you, I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna go right. Don\xe2\x80\x99t make a big deal out of it.\nScene: Raj\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nStuart: Is make-up really necessary?\nRaj: Well, when someone looks at your dating profile, the first thing they see is your picture. I just want to make sure you look fun and full of life and not like a body they just pulled out of the river. All right, here we go, and smile. Okay, uh-uh, that one\xe2\x80\x99s in the bank. How about this? Turn away, and then turn back into it. But when you do, imagine the camera is the girl you want to meet.\nStuart: You got it.\nRaj: Okay, uh, let\xe2\x80\x99s try it again. Uh, but this time, pretend the girl you want to meet doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to hurt you.\nStuart: I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I can give you that.\nRaj: Come on. One more time. Yeah, it\xe2\x80\x99s, it\xe2\x80\x99s a little blurry, but I think that works in your favour. Do you want a beer?\nStuart: Sure. Hey, have you finished writing your profile yet?\nRaj: Almost. Oh, what did you put as the one-word description of yourself?\nStuart: I put unobjectionable. But now that I hear it out loud, it just seems like I\xe2\x80\x99m being cocky. What did you put for your best feature?\nRaj: My parents\xe2\x80\x99 money. Uh, what did you put for your best feature?\nStuart: I put: not applicable.\nRaj: Come on, dude, you\xe2\x80\x99re being too hard on yourself. You\xe2\x80\x99ve got a lot of good stuff going on.\nStuart: Really? Like what?\nRaj: Well, okay, you\xe2\x80\x99re a, you\xe2\x80\x99re a talented artist, you own your own business.\nStuart: Neither of those things have ever helped me meet a woman.\nRaj: Okay, well, can we imply that you\xe2\x80\x99re well-endowed?\nStuart: I do have one oddly long testicle.\nRaj: Okay, now you\xe2\x80\x99re talking like a winner!\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: Whatcha doin\xe2\x80\x99?\nSheldon: Oh, it turns out Amy\xe2\x80\x99s beloved Pride and Prejudice is a flawless masterpiece. He\xe2\x80\x99s got too much pride, she\xe2\x80\x99s got too much prejudice, it just works.\nLeonard: So you\xe2\x80\x99re looking to ruin something for her in the funny pages?\nSheldon: Amy has a fondness for the comic strip Marmaduke.\nLeonard: Mm-hmm. And?\nSheldon: And I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve got it. Consider, a family possesses a dog that is so large and poorly disciplined, he causes nothing but problems. Why do they keep him?\nLeonard: Maybe they fell in love with him as a puppy and didn\xe2\x80\x99t know how big he was gonna be.\nSheldon: Of course. You know, why couldn\xe2\x80\x99t she just like Ziggy? Yeah? That thing\xe2\x80\x99s riddled with plot holes.\nLeonard: Sorry, buddy.\nSheldon: Ooh, I think she\xe2\x80\x99s a fan of Garfield as well. Oh, darn it, now so am I.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99ll see you later. I gotta go watch a stupid football game with Penny.\nSheldon: Wait, hang on. You\xe2\x80\x99ve spent time with Amy. Can you think of anything she\xe2\x80\x99s fond of that has a bunch of flaws she hasn\xe2\x80\x99t noticed?\nLeonard: I gotta go.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nLeonard: You ready to go?\nPenny: Yep. Hey, and maybe this time you don\xe2\x80\x99t try and talk sports with the guys.\nLeonard: Some sports bar. It\xe2\x80\x99s like they never even heard of Quidditch. Do we really have to go?\nPenny: Oh, come on. Every time we\xe2\x80\x99re about to hang out with my friends, you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to. It\xe2\x80\x99s like, It\xe2\x80\x99s too loud, or the bathroom\xe2\x80\x99s too dirty, or they put a chicken wing in my ear. I mean\xe2\x80\xa6\nLeonard: Well, you\xe2\x80\x99re, you\xe2\x80\x99re right. Let\xe2\x80\x99s just go.\nPenny: Hey, what\xe2\x80\x99s going on with you?\nLeonard: Nothing, I\xe2\x80\x99m fine.\nPenny: All right, hang on. is this still about your mom\xe2\x80\x99s book?\nLeonard: No. Not everything is about my mom.\nPenny: \xe2\x80\x98Cause if you\xe2\x80\x99re still upset about that, we don\xe2\x80\x99t have to go.\nLeonard: Except this is totally about my mom.\nPenny: I\xe2\x80\x99m so sorry. I never should have read that book. You know what? You want to just get dinner and watch the game here?\nLeonard: That sounds nice. Yeah.\nPenny: Okay.\nLeonard: Or, you know, we could get take-out and watch the Blu-ray extended version of The Hobbit movie with commentary track. On account of how sad I am about my mom.\nScene: Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s lab.\nHoward: Leonard, you ready for lunch?\nLeonard: One sec. Hey. Sorry.\nHoward: Hi, Penny.\nPenny: Hi. All right, sweetie. You hang in there today.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99ll try, but I might be sad again tonight.\nPenny: Okay.\nHoward: Wow. Sex at work?\nLeonard: Leave it alone. That\xe2\x80\x99s my girlfriend.\nHoward: Sorry.\nLeonard: Who just had sex with me at work.\nHoward: Damn. How\xe2\x80\x99d you swing that?\nLeonard: Well, whenever I talk about how awful my mom was, Penny will do anything to make me feel better.\nHoward: Seriously?\nLeonard: Look, I mean, I\xe2\x80\x99m not proud of it, but it does work. I got her to watch a six-part documentary on Monty Python. Even I was bored, I just wanted to see if she\xe2\x80\x99d make it to the end.\nHoward: You sound kind of proud of it.\nLeonard: I am, I\xe2\x80\x99m really proud.\nScene: The apartment.\nAmy (on webcam): Hello, Sheldon. Is everything okay?\nSheldon: Yes. Why?\nAmy: Well, the last time you made an unscheduled video-chat, there was a curly fry in your regular fries and you thought someone might be trying to slip you a mickey.\nSheldon: April 13, a dark night, indeed.\nAmy: So what can I do for you?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m calling to invite you to a spontaneous date night tomorrow evening.\nAmy: Really?\nSheldon: Yes. You were kind enough to watch Raiders of the Lost Ark with me. So I\xe2\x80\x99d like to return the favour by inviting you to watch an episode of your favourite childhood television series, Little House on the Prairie.\nAmy: That sounds lovely. Why are you rubbing your hands together?\nSheldon: Um, I\xe2\x80\x99m putting on lotion. Are you in or not?\nAmy: Of course I\xe2\x80\x99m in.\nSheldon: Excellent. Then I shall see you tomorrow. Good night, Dr. Fowler.\nAmy: Good night, Dr. Cooper.\nSheldon: Good night, indeed. What a rube. Why would I put on lotion when I have such soft hands?\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nBernadette: You were really quiet during dinner. Is everything okay?\nHoward: Yeah. I guess I was just thinking about my mom, and how sad my childhood was.\nBernadette: Yeah, I bet it sucked. I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna take a bath, you do the dishes.\nHoward: How about I take a bath with you and see what happens.\nBernadette: Here\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x99s gonna happen. I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna take a bath, and you\xe2\x80\x99re gonna do the dishes.\nHoward: That\xe2\x80\x99s it? No compassion?\nBernadette: Aw, poor Howie. We good? I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna take a bath.\nHoward: Bernie\xe2\x80\xa6\nBernadette: God, what is going on with you?\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m sharing my pain.\nBernadette: And I\xe2\x80\x99m not buying it. Try again.\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m learning to be a man in a culture where it\xe2\x80\x99s increasingly difficult to know how?\nBermadette: Strike two.\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m copying Leonard. When he does this to Penny, they have sex and watch Monty Python.\nBernadette: Howard.\nHoward: I know. It was dumb, I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have done it. And it\xe2\x80\x99s making me feel sad. So sad. You know, why don\xe2\x80\x99t you take a bath? I\xe2\x80\x99ll do the dishes.\nScene: Raj\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nRaj: Three, two, one.\nStuart: That\xe2\x80\x99s it. Our dating profiles are live on the Internet.\nRaj: Attention all shoppers, my business is open for business!\nStuart: That\xe2\x80\x99s right, ladies. For all you know, I\xe2\x80\x99m confident and fun to be around.\nRaj: Oh, cool, it tells you when someone\xe2\x80\x99s reading your profile. Jenny309. I hope that\xe2\x80\x99s not her weight.\nStuart: If it is, I\xe2\x80\x99ll take her. Ooh, I got one, too. The ladies are coming to us. Oh, man, if I\xe2\x80\x99d started this years ago, I\xe2\x80\x99d be divorced two or three times by now.\nRaj: What? Another one. You know, it, it\xe2\x80\x99s weird. When they\xe2\x80\x99re reading your profile, does it, does it make you feel exposed? Like they see you naked?\nStuart: Well, they\xe2\x80\x99re not running away screaming, so, no.\nScene: The apartment.\nAmy: I love Little House. It made me want to live on a farm so much I tried to milk my cat. That tangy bowl of Cheerios was not worth the stitches.\nSheldon: Well, you sit back, relax and enjoy a beloved childhood memory. You see that cabin there? I read they were illegally squatting on Indian land. Yeah. Personally, I think what we did to the Native Americans was wrong, but this is your favourite show, not mine. Oh, look at little Laura Ingalls, eating that peanut butter sandwich. Peanut butter? Huh? That\xe2\x80\x99s strange, since peanut butter wasn\xe2\x80\x99t introduced until the early 1900s. If I knew this show was about time travel, I would have watched it much sooner.\nAmy: You\xe2\x80\x99re trying to get back at me for what I said about Raiders of the Lost Ark.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s silly. Almost as silly as Dr. Baker having a telephone, since telephones only existed in large cities at that time. This is more like Little House on the Preposterous.\nAmy: Sheldon, we\xe2\x80\x99re in a relationship. When you get angry, just tell me. You don\xe2\x80\x99t need to seek revenge.\nSheldon: Are you sure? Every time my dad stayed out all night, my mom would put hamster poop in his chewing tobacco.\nAmy: Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s not how we\xe2\x80\x99re going to do it.\nSheldon: Fine. I\xe2\x80\x99m mad at you. Not only did you ruin Raiders for me, you may have ruined the whole franchise. Except for the fourth one, which was bad before you got your mitts on it.\nAmy: I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have said it. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.\nSheldon: Thank you.\nAmy: Do you feel better?\nSheldon: Yes. But not as good as I\xe2\x80\x99m going to when I tell you that your precious Garfield has no reason to hate Mondays. He\xe2\x80\x99s a cat. He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have a job.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nLeonard: Hey, I was just\xe2\x80\xa6 what is happening?\nPenny: Oh, just a little treat. I know you\xe2\x80\x99ve been feeling really bad about your mom lately.\nLeonard: Oh, oh, I have. So bad.\nPenny: And I wanted to make you feel better, so I planned something very special for you.\nLeonard: Uh-huh, I can already feel it working.\nMrs Hofstadter (on webcam): Hello, Leonard.\nLeonard: Mom?\nMrs Hofstadter: I understand you have been whining about my parenting in order to emotionally manipulate your girlfriend.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\xa6 uh\xe2\x80\xa6\nPenny: Bernadette told me everything. Now you don\xe2\x80\x99t get the left or the right.\nMrs Hofstadter: Let\xe2\x80\x99s discuss why you continue to involve me in your sex life.\nLeonard: Oh, please, Mommy. No, Mommy.\nMrs Hofstadter: When you were six years old, you walked in on me and your father naked. I was swatting his bottom with your brand new Ping Pong paddle.\nLeonard: I didn\xe2\x80\x99t dream that?\nMrs Hofstadter: How did that make you feel?\nLeonard: Penny, come back. I\xe2\x80\x99m sad for real now.\nScene: Raj\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nRaj: In the last two hours, 162 women have read our profiles. How many of them have sent us messages?\nStuart: Combined?\nRaj: Yes.\nStuart: Zero.\nRaj: Dude, this is, this is brutal.\nStuart: I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever felt so rejected. And I had a rescue dog who ran back to the pound.\nRaj: This is the worst. If we\xe2\x80\x99re gonna get shot down, we might as well just go to a bar and do it old school.\nStuart: And make them look us in the eye.\nRaj: Yeah, anything is better than this.\nScene: A bar.\nRaj: Hello.\nGirl: Not interested.\nRaj: I was wrong. This is worse.\nScene: The apartment.\nHoward: Wait, wait, if it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t for Indiana Jones, the ark would never have ended up at the warehouse.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s true. He collected and delivered the ark to the proper authorities for filing.\nRaj: Like a hero.\nAll: Yeah!\nLeonard: Although, technically, Indy was supposed to take the ark to a museum to be studied. He couldn\xe2\x80\x99t even get that done.\nAll: Aw!\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
