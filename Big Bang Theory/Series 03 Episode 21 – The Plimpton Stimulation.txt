b'Scene: The university cafeteria.\nSheldon: Hold.\nRaj: What?\nSheldon: Explain your sneeze.\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry?\nSheldon: Do you have allergies?\nRaj: No.\nSheldon: Is there too much pepper on your salad?\nRaj: I don\xe2\x80\x99t put pepper on salads.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard enough. Sit over there.\nRaj: Oh, come on. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to sit by myself.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s what Typhoid Mary said, and clearly, her friends buckled.\nRaj: Guys, help me.\nHoward: Sheldon, come on.\nLeonard: Yeah, it\xe2\x80\x99s just one sneeze. (Raj sneezes) You\xe2\x80\x99re on your own.\nHoward: See you, buddy.\nSheldon: Oh, Leonard, I have something for you. Per our roommate agreement, this is your 24-hour notice that I will be having a non-related female spending two nights in our apartment.\nLeonard: When you say non-related female, you still mean human, right?\nSheldon: Of course. Pets are banned under the roommate agreement, with the exception of service animals, such as seeing eye dogs and, one day, cybernetically-enhanced helper monkeys.\nHoward: Are you planning on kidnapping a woman?\nSheldon: Sarcasm?\nHoward: Yes, but mixed with genuine concern.\nSheldon: For your information, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be playing host to Dr. Elizabeth Plimpton.\nRaj: The cosmological physicist from Princeton?\nSheldon: Yes. And until you acquire a surgical mask, please address your comments to me through a napkin. We\xe2\x80\x99ve been corresponding for years about our mutual interest in gravitational wave signatures of inflatons in the early universe. And now she\xe2\x80\x99s under consideration for a position at our university.\nLeonard: Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you tell me you knew Elizabeth Plimpton? I am a huge fan of hers!\nSheldon: I didn\xe2\x80\x99t realize I was obligated to share my connection with things you\xe2\x80\x99re a fan of, but very well. You enjoy Canadian bacon. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been to Toronto.\nLeonard: Okay, fine. Where is she going to sleep?\nSheldon: My room, of course.\nRaj: Holy crap! (Through napkin) Holy crap!\nHoward: Yeah, um, I have a two-part question.\nSheldon: Go ahead.\nHoward: A, are you kidding me? And B, seriously, are you freaking kidding me?\nSheldon: A, I rarely kid. And B, when I do kid, you will know it by my use of the word bazinga.\nHoward: So you\xe2\x80\x99re saying the two of you are going to be sleeping in the same bed?\nSheldon: Yes. Bazinga. Leonard?\nLeonard: Thank you. Why is a world-renowned scientist staying in our apartment instead of a hotel?\nSheldon: Well, she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t care for hotels. And who can blame her? Windows that don\xe2\x80\x99t open, multi-user linens, keys shaped like credit cards, as if one walks around with unassigned slots in one\xe2\x80\x99s wallet. All right, I believe I have time for one more question. Yes, Raj?\nRaj: When can I sit with you again?\nSheldon: When I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen two consecutive negative throat cultures spaced 12 hours apart. You know the drill. All right, if you\xe2\x80\x99ll excuse me, I am off to start a prophylactic course of antibiotics.\nLeonard: I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe he\xe2\x80\x99s friends with Elizabeth Plimpton.\nRaj: I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe they let him into Canada.\nHoward: Whoa, whoa, whoa. You heard the man. Where\xe2\x80\x99s your throat cultures? Kidding. Sit down.\nCredits sequence\n  Scene: The lobby\nPenny: Hey, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Oh, Penny, excellent. I have a question about these maxi pads. Are the wings truly functional or have I fallen victim to marketing hype?\nPenny: What? What are you doing with, what?\nSheldon: The stock boy at Walgreens was frustratingly uninformed on the subject.\nPenny: Sheldon, what are you doing with maxi pads?\nSheldon: I have a lady friend who will be staying with me for a few days.\nPenny: Oh. What?\nSheldon: I want her to feel at home. I also bought scented soaps, pantyhose, Midol, calcium chews and what is apparently a yogurt specifically designed to regulate the female bowel.\nPenny: Wait, wait, hold on, back up. You\xe2\x80\x99re having a woman stay with you?\nSheldon: Yes. Why does that seem to flabbergast everybody?\nPenny: Oh, no, no, no, no. I\xe2\x80\x99m not flabbergasted. I\xe2\x80\x99m puzzled. Yeah, let\xe2\x80\x99s go with puzzled.\nSheldon: A word of warning. My guest is a noted physicist and the leading expert on quantum cosmology, so please try to avoid wasting her time with female jibber jabber.\nPenny: Female jibber jabber?\nSheldon: Shoe sales, hair styles, mud masks, gossip about your friends Brad and Angelina.\nPenny: Oh, they\xe2\x80\x99re not my friends.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m not surprised, considering the way you talk about them behind their backs.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: She\xe2\x80\x99s here, she\xe2\x80\x99s here. How do I look? Do I look smart?\nSheldon: Oh, good grief. This isn\xe2\x80\x99t about you. Coming! Now listen, one of the great minds of the 21st century is about to play host to one of the other great minds of the 21st century. So pay attention. Years from now, my biographer might ask you about this event.\nLeonard: Oh, I have so many things to tell your biographer.\nElizabeth: Ah, Dr. Cooper, thank goodness. I completely forgot your address. But then I remembered that I\xe2\x80\x99d written it on my hand. Lucky for me, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t confuse it with what I\xe2\x80\x99d written on my other hand, which are the coordinates for a newly discovered neutron star. \xe2\x80\x98Cause if I tried to go there, I\xe2\x80\x99d be crushed by hypergravity. Anyway, hello.\nSheldon: Hello.\nElizabeth: Nice to finally meet you in person.\nSheldon: I would imagine it is. This is my friend and roommate, Dr. Leonard Hofstadter.\nLeonard: Hi-lo. Oops. I started to say hi, and then I switched to hello in the middle. It came out hi-lo. Duh. Uh, it\xe2\x80\x99s nice to meet you. I\xe2\x80\x99ve read both your books and most of your papers. I\xe2\x80\x99m Leonard, I live\nhere, you\xe2\x80\x99re brilliant.\nSheldon: I apologize. He\xe2\x80\x99s only an experimental physicist.\nElizabeth: No need to apologize. Some of my best friends are experimental physicists. Well, not my best friends, but I know them. My best friend is a molecular chemist named Wendy. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, I\xe2\x80\x99m rambling. Hi-lo.\nLeonard: Are you hungry, thirsty? Can I offer you anything?\nSheldon: No, she\xe2\x80\x99s my guest. If anyone should offer her anything, it should be me. Elizabeth, can I get you something? Perhaps a feminine hygiene product or a bowel-regulating yogurt?\nElizabeth: Interesting choices. Based on my current needs, I guess I\xe2\x80\x99d pick the yogurt.\nSheldon: Excellent. If the yogurt works, I bought some delightful scented candles.\nLeonard: Look, it\xe2\x80\x99s you.\nScene: A little later.\nElizabeth: Thank you so much for opening up your home to me.\nLeonard: Well, who wants to stay in a hotel? With windows that don\xe2\x80\x99t open, those crazy card-shaped keys.\nElizabeth: I\xe2\x80\x99m so glad you understand.\nSheldon: No, he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t understand. I understand.\nLeonard: Well, I understand, too.\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re just misappropriating my understanding.\nLeonard: Oh, (blows a raspberry). I think any university would want you. Except, of course, any university that had already had you. Because they would\xe2\x80\x99ve already wanted you before they, you know, got you.\nSheldon: From the mind that brought you hi-lo. Let me show you to your room.\nElizabeth: All right. I guess I am tired. Good night, Leonard.\nLeonard: Uh, sleep night. I mean, obviously, good night. I started to say sleep tight, then I changed my mind in the middle. I swear to God, I\xe2\x80\x99m smart.\nSheldon: Get it together, man.\nScene: Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom.\nSheldon: All right, let me show you some of the features of the room. First, windows. Conventional. Open, closed, open, closed, halfway open, or halfway closed, depending on your philosophical bent. Over here is my comic book collection. Feel free to browse. There\xe2\x80\x99s a box of disposable reading gloves on the night stand.\nElizabeth: Good to know.\nSheldon: In here, you\xe2\x80\x99ll find emergency provisions. An eight-day supply of food and water, a crossbow, season two of Star Trek: The Original Series on a high-density flash drive.\nElizabeth: What if there\xe2\x80\x99s a disaster that destroys all the USB ports?\nSheldon: Then there\xe2\x80\x99s really no reason to live, is there?\nElizabeth: Can I ask a question about your roommate?\nSheldon: He\xe2\x80\x99s an odd duck, isn\xe2\x80\x99t he?\nElizabeth: What\xe2\x80\x99s his relationship status?\nSheldon: Well, there was a misbegotten adventure with a waitress who lives across the hall. It ended as inexplicably as it began. They had very little in common, except for carnal activity. That\xe2\x80\x99s why I acquired these noise-cancelling headphones. If you decide to use them, please clean the ear pieces afterwards with the Wet Wipes you\xe2\x80\x99ll find in the bathroom. They\xe2\x80\x99re in the drawer labelled Wet Wipes.\nElizabeth: Okay.\nSheldon: Good. I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave you to your night time ablutions. I\xe2\x80\x99ve e-mailed you the morning bathroom schedule. You\xe2\x80\x99ll also find a laminated copy in your welcome packet. It\xe2\x80\x99s on the back of the emergency escape route diagram.\nElizabeth: How thoughtful.\nSheldon: Sleep well, my friend.\nElizabeth: You, too.\nSheldon: Oh, let me just get one thing. It\xe2\x80\x99s my backup emergency supply kit. The living room escape route doesn\xe2\x80\x99t pass through here. Now, good night. And if there\xe2\x80\x99s an apocalypse, good luck.\nScene: Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom. There is a knock on the door.\nLeonard: Yes?\nElizabeth: I saw your light on.\nLeonard: Is everything all right?\nElizabeth: Yeah, I just couldn\xe2\x80\x99t sleep.\nLeonard: Me neither. Oh, look what I\xe2\x80\x99m reading. It\xe2\x80\x99s you.\nElizabeth: I thought you already read it.\nLeonard: I did, but it\xe2\x80\x99s been a while, and I wanted to sound smart over breakfast.\nElizabeth: Aw, you\xe2\x80\x99re smart.\nLeonard: Oh, good. Wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure it was coming across.\nElizabeth: What chapter are you on?\nLeonard: Uh, six.\nElizabeth: Oh, the extragalactic distance ladder. Want to know a little secret?\nLeonard: Sure.\nElizabeth: I wrote the section on the Wilson-Bappu Effect completely naked.\nLeonard: Really? Uh, sure doesn\xe2\x80\x99t read that way.\nElizabeth: Here, let me show you. When we consider the brightness of pulsating variable stars, we start to see (removes robe) a possible explanation for some of the discrepancies found in Hubble\xe2\x80\x99s constant.\nLeonard: Wow. You really make science come alive.\nScene: The living room.\nSheldon: Vocal test. Morning vocal test. Second vocal test. Second morning vocal test.\nLeonard: Morning, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Morning.\nElizabeth: Morning, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Morning. I trust you had a pleasant night.\nElizabeth: More than pleasant.\nSheldon: Excuse me, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to relieve myself.\nLeonard: How do you take your coffee?\nElizabeth: Black.\nLeonard: Okeydoke.\nSheldon (in bathroom): Pee for Houston, pee for Austin, pee for the state my heart got lost in. And shake twice for Texas.\nLeonard: Something his mother taught him.\nSheldon: All right, Elizabeth, the bathroom is yours. The seat is down, and has been sanitized for your protection.\nElizabeth: That\xe2\x80\x99s very thoughtful, but I think I\xe2\x80\x99ll finish my coffee first.\nSheldon: Ah, so the yogurt didn\xe2\x80\x99t work. I\xe2\x80\x99ll fire off a critical e-mail to the manufacturer.\nPenny: Oh, good, you\xe2\x80\x99re up. Look, my car won\xe2\x80\x99t start. I need a ride to work.\nSheldon: Did you once again ignore your check engine light?\nPenny: No, Mr. smarty-pants. I ignored the fill gas tank light.\nSheldon: Leonard, Penny wants to exploit any residual feelings you have for her in order to get a ride to work.\nLeonard: Oh, yeah, sure, let me just put this in a travel mug.\nPenny: Hello.\nElizabeth: Hi.\nPenny: Oh, Penny, this is Dr. Plimpton, a leading expert on quantum cosmology. Dr. Plimpton, Penny is a waitress who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t understand the role gasoline plays in the internal combustion engine.\nElizabeth: Nice to meet you.\nPenny: Nice to meet you, too. Are you enjoying your stay?\nElizabeth: Yes, very much.\nPenny: Good.\nSheldon: Wonderful. Meaningless pleasantries accomplished. Elizabeth, Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s bathroom time is coming up, and believe me, you do not want to follow him.\nElizabeth: Excuse me.\nLeonard: Okay, well, I guess I should get dressed so I can take everyone to work. You and Sheldon and Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s friend, Dr. Plimpton, who you just met. It\xe2\x80\x99ll be fun. Like a clown car.\nPenny: Hang on.\nLeonard: Hmm? Yeah? What? Huh?\nPenny: We just broke up.\nLeonard: What, uh, you and me? Yeah, we did. Not too long ago. How are you doing with it?\nPenny: Not as good as you apparently.\nLeonard: I, um, I don\xe2\x80\x99t follow.\nPenny: You know what? It\xe2\x80\x99s, it\xe2\x80\x99s none of my business. If you want to sleep with Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s doctor buddy right after we stopped seeing each other, go for it.\nLeonard: Well, now\xe2\x80\xa6\nSheldon: Excuse me. I\xe2\x80\x99m uncomfortable with you recommending that Leonard pursue having intercourse with Dr. Plimpton, who I assure you has better things to do.\nPenny: I\xe2\x80\x99m not recommending it. I\xe2\x80\x99m saying it already happened.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s preposterous. Tell her, Leonard.\nLeonard: Well\xe2\x80\xa6\nSheldon: No.\nLeonard: Come on. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t my fault.\nSheldon: The implication being that you somehow tripped and fell into her lady parts?\nPenny: You know what? I\xe2\x80\x99m just gonna take the bus to work.\nLeonard: Penny, I can still drive you.\nPenny: Oh, no, no, it\xe2\x80\x99s okay. You might slip on a banana peel and get me pregnant.\nSheldon: I must say, I\xe2\x80\x99m shocked by this betrayal.\nLeonard: I didn\xe2\x80\x99t betray Penny.\nSheldon: Not Penny, me!\nLeonard: How am I betraying you?\nSheldon: Elizabeth\xe2\x80\x99s my friend, and you\xe2\x80\x99re playing with her!\nLeonard: Yeah, I guess I did.\nScene: The cafeteria. Raj drinks from a hip flask.\nHoward: What the hell are you doing?\nRaj: Relax, it\xe2\x80\x99s Nyquil.\nLeonard: You still have a cold?\nRaj: Maybe, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t care. That\xe2\x80\x99s the great thing about Nyquil, it\xe2\x80\x99s like ten-percent booze. I call it the nighttime sniffling, sneezing, coughing, so you can talk to girls medicine.\nLeonard: Are you having trouble sleeping? \xe2\x80\x98Cause, boy, I was up all night.\nRaj: Did you get a cold, too?\nLeonard: No, but I was awake all night.\nHoward: If you want, I can give you some of my mom\xe2\x80\x99s sleeping pills.\nRaj: She won\xe2\x80\x99t notice they\xe2\x80\x99re missing?\nHoward: She doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know she takes them.\nLeonard: No, that\xe2\x80\x99s okay. It was something else keeping me up last night. And again this morning. And, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mind. I was up last night. I was up this morning. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mind. Those are your clues.\nRaj: Ooh, ooh. Did the pigeon on your windowsill have more babies?\nLeonard: No.\nHoward: Were you up making another stop-motion Lego movie?\nLeonard: No.\nHoward: \xe2\x80\x98Cause let me tell you, it\xe2\x80\x99s not enough to make the Legos move, they also have to capture your heart.\nLeonard: Okay, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you one more clue. It involved another person.\nRaj: Did you get a Japanese love pillow?\nHoward: How is a Japanese love pillow another person?\nRaj: It is if you love her and give her a name.\nSheldon: Dr. Plimpton, I\xe2\x80\x99d like you to meet my colleagues, Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali\nRaj: Hi.\nSheldon: And not-a-doctor Howard Wolowitz.\nHoward: Hi.\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99m a big fan of your work.\nElizabeth: Thank you.\nSheldon: And of course, you\xe2\x80\x99ve already introduced yourself to Dr. Hofstadter.\nLeonard: Hey, you.\nElizabeth: Hey, you.\nLeonard: Boy, I\xe2\x80\x99m kind of tuckered out. How are you feeling, Elizabeth?\nElizabeth: You know what? I am a little tired. Would you be a dear and get me a cup of coffee?\nLeonard: Sure. Black, right?\nElizabeth: Actually, now I think I want it hot, brown and sweet.\nLeonard: Coming right up.\nScene: Raj\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nRaj: What?\nHoward: What do you mean what? It\xe2\x80\x99s Halo night.\nRaj: I can\xe2\x80\x99t. I\xe2\x80\x99m too sick. Go away.\nHoward: That\xe2\x80\x99s why we moved Halo night here. Look, I brought my mom\xe2\x80\x99s chicken soup.\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99m not hungry.\nElizabeth: Don\xe2\x80\x99t send him away. Let him in.\nHoward: Who\xe2\x80\x99s that\nRaj: I bought a parrot.\nHoward: Yeah, right. Dr. Plimpton?\nElizabeth: Hi. Howard, right?\nHoward: Uh, yeah.\nElizabeth: Can I ask you a question, Howard? Do you like role-playing games?\nHoward: Yeah, sure. In fact, I\xe2\x80\x99m a dungeon master.\nElizabeth: Not tonight. Tonight you are a delivery man. You brought soup, but uh-oh, Raj and I don\xe2\x80\x99t have enough money to pay you. So we\xe2\x80\x99ll have to come to some other kind of arrangement.\nHoward: Beg pardon?\nElizabeth: You two figure out the details, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to go change into something I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind getting ripped off my milky flesh.\nHoward: What the frak?\nRaj: Go away. She wants New Delhi, not Kosher deli. Besides, you have a girlfriend.\nHoward: We broke up weeks ago.\nRaj: Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you say anything?\nHoward: I was waiting for the right time. This is the right time.\nLeonard: Hey, who\xe2\x80\x99s ready for Halo?\nRaj: Oh, this is like a nightmare. Get lost!\nHoward: He\xe2\x80\x99s right. The numbers are shaky enough as it is.\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand.\nElizabeth: Oh, good. Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s here.\nRaj: Good?\nLeonard: Elizabeth? What\xe2\x80\x99s going on?\nElizabeth: What\xe2\x80\x99s going on is you and Howard are my moving men and Raj is my new landlord and I don\xe2\x80\x99t have enough money to pay any of you.\nLeonard: Is she suggesting what I think she\xe2\x80\x99s suggesting?\nHoward: Yep. Welcome to the Penthouse Forum.\nRaj: Okay, show of hands. Who\xe2\x80\x99s up for this? (Only Howard raises his hand.)\nLeonard: We\xe2\x80\x99ll all be naked in front of each other.\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m out.\nElizabeth: Everybody ready?\nRaj: Follow my lead. Almost. We\xe2\x80\x99re, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to go out into the hallway and, uh, make a dramatic entrance.\nElizabeth: Oh, good. It\xe2\x80\x99s so much better when everyone commits.\nRaj: Run. Run, run, run. Don\xe2\x80\x99t look back.\nLeonard: I thought we had something special.\nRaj (locks door): So, you say you can\xe2\x80\x99t pay your rent?\nScene: The lobby.\nPenny: Oh, Leonard?\nLeonard: Hey.\nPenny: I found these in the dryer. I\xe2\x80\x99m assuming they belong to Sheldon.\nLeonard: Thanks. It\xe2\x80\x99s really hard to find these in his size. So, listen. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been meaning to talk to you about the other morning.\nPenny: You mean you and Dr. Slutbunny?\nLeonard: Yeah, I wanted to explain.\nPenny: Well, you don\xe2\x80\x99t owe me an explanation.\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t?\nPenny: No, you don\xe2\x80\x99t.\nLeonard: So you\xe2\x80\x99re not judging me?\nPenny: Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m judging you nine ways to Sunday, but you don\xe2\x80\x99t owe me an explanation.\nLeonard: Nevertheless, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to get one on the record so you can understand why I did what I did.\nPenny: I\xe2\x80\x99m listening.\nLeonard: She let me.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
