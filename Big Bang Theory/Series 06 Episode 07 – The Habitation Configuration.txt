b'Scene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Hello, I\xe2\x80\x99m Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Welcome to Sheldon Cooper Presents Fun with Flags. Before we get started, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to announce the winner of our design your own flag competition. But I can\xe2\x80\x99t. The only entry was from GameyGamer75, and I know that was a jpeg of your buttocks. Now this week we have a very special episode where we explore the flags of the popular entertainment franchise, Star Trek. And to help me, I\xe2\x80\x99m pleased to introduce Internet personality, former star of Star Trek: The Next Generation, and the only guy I know lucky enough to be immortalized in one sixteenth scale. Set phasers to fun for my friend, Wil Wheaton.\nWil: Hi, Sheldon. Thanks for having me. I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to be here.\nAmy: Cut.\nSheldon: What\xe2\x80\x99s wrong?\nAmy: Sorry, Sheldon, you were brilliant as always. Wil, that was a little wooden.\nWil: Wooden?\nAmy: Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t terrible. Just, this time, try to say it the way people sound. And action.\nSheldon: My friend, Wil Wheaton.\nWil: Hi, Sheldon. Thanks for having me. I\xe2\x80\x99m excited to be here.\nSheldon: So, Wil, what do you have for us first?\nWil: Well, this is an exciting one. This is the flag of the United Federation of Planets. Now what\xe2\x80\x99s interesting about this flag\xe2\x80\xa6\nAmy: Cut.\nWil: What was wrong with that?\nAmy: It\xe2\x80\x99s called Fun with Flags. They\xe2\x80\x99re not at half-mast, nobody died. Let\xe2\x80\x99s try and keep it upbeat.\nWil: Um, no offence, but I\xe2\x80\x99ve been acting since I was a kid. I think I can handle a Web show without a lot of direction.\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s true. In 1982, Wil played the voice of Martin the mouse in The Secret of NIMH. You moved me.\nAmy: You\xe2\x80\x99ll have to forgive me. This is my first time directing, I just want it to be good.\nWil: So do I.\nAmy: Great. So, this time let\xe2\x80\x99s try more real boy, less Pinocchio. And action.\nWil: And cut. You realize that I\xe2\x80\x99m doing this for free, right?\nAmy: Yes. And so far, we\xe2\x80\x99re still not getting our money\xe2\x80\x99s worth. Let\xe2\x80\x99s try it again. Everybody\xe2\x80\x99s having fun. And action.\nSheldon: So, Wil, what do you have for us first?\nWil: Well, this is an exciting one. This is the flag of the United Federation of Planets.\nAmy: Cut.\nWil: Problem, first-time director?\nSheldon: Oh, none that I could see. I saw a man who loved flags almost as much as I do. I got goose bumps.\nAmy: He was overacting on purpose.\nSheldon: Really? He reminded me of a young William Shatner.\nWil: Listen, Sheldon, I\xe2\x80\x99m really happy to do this for you, but not if she\xe2\x80\x99s gonna be a huge pain in the ass the whole time.\nAmy: You gonna let him speak to me like that?\nSheldon: Well, you\xe2\x80\x99re my girlfriend and I don\xe2\x80\x99t want you to be upset. Then again, Wil Wheaton\xe2\x80\x99s my friend and I don\xe2\x80\x99t want him to be upset. Hmm, this is a sticky wicket. (To Wil) What do you think?\nAmy: Can I speak to you for a second?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99ll be right back. Feel free to play with yourself.\nAmy: I don\xe2\x80\x99t care for your friend, he\xe2\x80\x99s being rude to me. You need to ask him to leave.\nSheldon: Amy, I can\xe2\x80\x99t just ask Wil Wheaton to leave. He\xe2\x80\x99s a minor celebrity. Once you explain who he is, many people recognize him.\nAmy: Fine. Then maybe I should go.\nSheldon: Could you? That would solve everything. You are the best. I\xe2\x80\x99ll see you at dinner tonight?\nAmy: You sure you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t rather have dinner with your friend Wil Wheaton?\nSheldon: Come to think of it, I would! You, little lady, are on fire.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: Howard\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom.\nBernadette: Every time we eat dinner here, your mother refuses to let me help with the dishes.\nHoward: Don\xe2\x80\x99t take it personally. She likes doing them by herself so she can lick the plates with no one looking.\nBernadette: You ready to go?\nHoward: Yeah, let me just grab a couple of fresh turtlenecks.\nBernadette: I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand why you keep your stuff here when there\xe2\x80\x99s plenty of room at home.\nHoward: What are you talking about? All I have here is a few sweaters, books, bank stuff, computers, mail, collectibles, medicine and my electric body groomer. Ooh, there\xe2\x80\x99s my plaid dickie. Oh, got this at the Goodwill store for 50 cents. Can you believe it?\nBernadette: 50 cents sounds right. Let\xe2\x80\x99s go.\nHoward: You know, it\xe2\x80\x99s kinda late. Why don\xe2\x80\x99t we just spend the night here?\nBernadette: Because we don\xe2\x80\x99t live here.\nHoward: I know.\nBernadette: Do you? You said when you got back from space you were gonna move into my apartment, but half the time we stay here.\nHoward: That\xe2\x80\x99s not true.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Howard, I\xe2\x80\x99m doing laundry. You want me to put anything in for you?\nHoward: There\xe2\x80\x99s some underwear in the hamper.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Oh, good, I got that new stain stick to try out.\nHoward: Thank you, I only put it on the list two weeks ago. Okay, I see what you\xe2\x80\x99re getting at. How about this weekend I\xe2\x80\x99ll box up all my things and move them to our place.\nBernadette: Thank you.\nHoward: The lightsabres are gonna look great in the living room.\nBernadette: Or in the closet. We can decide later.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Howard, help, my hand\xe2\x80\x99s stuck in the garbage disposal.\nHoward: Let go of whatever piece of food you\xe2\x80\x99re holding.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Are you kidding? It\xe2\x80\x99s a perfectly good chicken leg.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: Hey, look who\xe2\x80\x99s out after dark, like a big boy.\nSheldon: I was out raising heck with Mr. Wil Wheaton. Four hours more and we would have closed down the HomeTown Buffet.\nLeonard: I thought you had plans with Amy.\nSheldon: Yeah, I did, but then Wil called Amy a pain in the A-S-S. She got huffy and left, then Wil and I headed out to dinner. That place really did remind me of my hometown. Because there we also have a HomeTown Buffet.\nLeonard: Hold on. Wil and Amy had an argument?\nSheldon: Yes, quite the kerfuffle.\nLeonard: Then Amy got mad and left?\nSheldon: Walked right out the door.\nLeonard: And you?\nSheldon: Enjoyed a delightful dinner at a reasonable price. The manager recognized Wil and let us sit right next to the frozen yoghurt machine. Right next to it. I was closer to it than I am to you right now.\nLeonard: Buddy, I think Amy might be upset.\nSheldon: Why\xe2\x80\x99s that?\nLeonard: Because your friend was rude to her, and then you went to dinner with him.\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re just repeating what I said. It\xe2\x80\x99s like living with a lactose-intolerant parrot.\nLeonard: Trust me, call her.\nSheldon: Fine. It\xe2\x80\x99s a shame you didn\xe2\x80\x99t go to dinner with us, because the buffet you\xe2\x80\x99re about to enjoy only serves humble pie, a dessert much less tasty than frozen yoghurt. I was this close.\nAmy (on skype): What?\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99ll appreciate this. Leonard has some ridiculous notion that you\xe2\x80\x99re mad at me. Tell him you\xe2\x80\x99re not mad at me. Go ahead, set him straight.\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99m mad at you, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Hmm. Eat one of your Luna bars. Very often when women think they\xe2\x80\x99re angry, they\xe2\x80\x99re really just hungry.\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99m not hungry. Your friend insulted me, and you didn\xe2\x80\x99t do anything.\nSheldon: Precisely, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t do anything. Now does someone feel like checking her emotional math?\nLeonard: Keep going, buddy, you\xe2\x80\x99re doing great.\nAmy: Sheldon, I\xe2\x80\x99m your girlfriend, and you should have taken my side. That\xe2\x80\x99s it. End of story. Good night.\nSheldon: Wow, Amy\xe2\x80\x99s mad and Leonard was right. What a weird day.\nScene: The Cheesecake Factory.\nPenny: Hey. Sorry this took so long. But you used to work here, you know how it is.\nBernadette: Kitchen slammed again?\nPenny: No, I\xe2\x80\x99m a terrible waitress, remember?\nBernadette: So, is there anything I can do to help you with the move tomorrow?\nHoward: Now that you mention it, I was thinking tomorrow might not be great.\nBernadette: What\xe2\x80\x99s your excuse this time?\nHoward: No excuse. It\xe2\x80\x99s just, you know, I\xe2\x80\x99m Jewish, and technically, we\xe2\x80\x99re not supposed to drive or carry anything on the Sabbath. So this one\xe2\x80\x99s on God.\nBernadette: That might be a little more convincing if you didn\xe2\x80\x99t have a mouthful of bacon cheeseburger.\nHoward: My religion\xe2\x80\x99s kinda loosey-goosey. Basically, as long as you got your schmekel clipped and don\xe2\x80\x99t wear a cross, you\xe2\x80\x99re good.\nBernadette: Howie, you promised you\xe2\x80\x99d move.\nHoward: And I will.\nPenny: Yeah, right.\nHoward: I will. I\xe2\x80\x99m obviously not going to live in my mother\xe2\x80\x99s house for the rest of my life. I\xe2\x80\x99m not a child.\nPenny: I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen her burp you.\nHoward: She did not burp me. She was patting me on the back, and I happened to burp. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you have other tables you should be waiting on?\nPenny: Yeah, but I told you, I\xe2\x80\x99m not good at my job. Bernadette, listen to me. He is never gonna leave.\nBernadette: I\xe2\x80\x99m starting to think you\xe2\x80\x99re right.\nHoward: All right, I\xe2\x80\x99ve had enough of this. I\xe2\x80\x99m a grown man, I have a successful career, for the love of God, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been to space. I will move out when I\xe2\x80\x99m ready, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t need anyone badgering me into it.\nPenny: Wow, excuse me.\nHoward: That was just for her benefit. I\xe2\x80\x99ll move tomorrow. I love you. Don\xe2\x80\x99t leave me.\nScene: Amy\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Angry Amy.\nAmy: What?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99ve been thinking about what happened, and I hope this gift will make things better.\nAmy: Star Trek DVDs? Why would I want this?\nSheldon: First of all, you\xe2\x80\x99re welcome. And furthermore, not being familiar with Wil Wheaton\xe2\x80\x99s body of work, there was no way for you to know you were being rude to a national treasure. Get ready for 130 hours of I told you so. (She hands him back the DVDs and slams the door) Fine. I\xe2\x80\x99ll just tell you what happens. Episode one, Encounter at Farpoint. Fade in. The new Enterprise heads out on its maiden voyage to contact the Bandi people of Deneb IV. Enter Wesley Crusher, played by my buddy\xe2\x80\xa6 (Amy opens door, grabs DVDs, slams door again) She\xe2\x80\x99s hooked.\nScene: Howard\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom.\nRaj: Wow. An end of an era.\nHoward: Boy, if these walls could talk.\nLeonard: They\xe2\x80\x99d say, why does he touch himself so much?\nHoward: Yeah. I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to live here anymore. This has always been my bedroom. Right here is where my mom used to mark my height.\nLeonard: Oh, yeah. Fifth grade. Sixth grade. Seventh grade. Eighth grade. Ninth grade.\nHoward: I remember when I was five, hiding under this desk with all my Halloween candy. Had some Peanut M&M\xe2\x80\x99S, went into my first anaphylactic shock and had to be rushed to the hospital. Came home, celebrated with a Snickers, went into my second anaphylactic shock.\nRaj: When did you figure out you were allergic to nuts?\nHoward: Sometime around the third Almond Joy.\nLeonard: Okay. You want to start loading this stuff into the truck?\nHoward: Yeah, I guess. Hey, would you do me a favour? Go on ahead. I just want one last moment alone in my old room.\nLeonard: We\xe2\x80\x99re not standing outside by the U-Haul while you fondle yourself.\nHoward: Fine, let\xe2\x80\x99s go.\nScene: The Cheesecake Factory Bar.\nPenny: Hey. What brings you in?\nSheldon: Penny, if you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t mind, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to have a conversation about girls.\nPenny: I had a feeling we\xe2\x80\x99d have a talk like this sooner or later. Are you finally getting fuzz in weird places?\nSheldon: Penny, please, I\xe2\x80\x99m on the horns of a relationship dilemma. And for the record, I had a full pubis of hair by the time I was 19.\nPenny: And for the record, bleugh. So what are you drinking?\nSheldon: Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s been a rough day. I usually go chamomile tea, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x99s going to cut it.\nPenny: You could have a Long Island Iced Tea.\nSheldon: Will that calm my nerves?\nPenny: It\xe2\x80\x99s calmed the pants off me a couple of times.\nSheldon: Sold.\nPenny: Oh. So, the heart you got from the wizard giving you trouble?\nSheldon: The trouble isn\xe2\x80\x99t with me, Penny, it\xe2\x80\x99s with your gender. Someday, scientists will discover that second X chromosome contains nothing but nonsense and twaddle.\nPenny: Yeah, Amy told me what happened. Look, just apologize. It\xe2\x80\x99ll warm her twaddle.\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s a Band-Aid at best. See, the core problem is that Amy and Wil do not like each other. Which is baffling because they\xe2\x80\x99re both crazy about me. And I like them, which indicates they\xe2\x80\x99re bright and interesting and/or were on Star Trek.\nPenny: Honey, you can\xe2\x80\x99t make people like each other.\nSheldon: Not true. Leonard made me like you. And let me tell you, that was a hard row to hoe. Cheers, pal. Ooh. Boy, that is a treat that\xe2\x80\x99s hard to beat. Get the Mad Hatter on the horn, I\xe2\x80\x99m having a tea party.\nPenny: You might want to pace yourself.\nSheldon: I drink tea all the time. I think I know what I\xe2\x80\x99m doing.\nPenny: Far be it from me to criticize a man with a full pubis. Look, Sheldon, your problem is not Wil Wheaton, okay? Your problem is the way you treated Amy.\nSheldon: My problem is I\xe2\x80\x99m out of tea.\nPenny: Come on, someone insulted your girlfriend and you just let him do it. I thought you Texas guys stood up for your womenfolk.\nSheldon: Penny, please, I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve evolved beyond my simple rustic upbringing.\nPenny: Sorry.\nSheldon: On the other hand, that low-down polecat done wronged my woman.\nPenny: Welcome to Long Island, Tex.\nSheldon: Amy deserves better. You know, when we buy the Planter\xe2\x80\x99s deluxe mix, she eats all the Brazil nuts so I don\xe2\x80\x99t have to look at them. She\xe2\x80\x99s a unique blend of saint and squirrel.\nPenny: Yeah, that she is. Here you go.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m a callous egomaniac. She\xe2\x80\x99s gonna leave me.\nPenny: No, she won\xe2\x80\x99t.\nSheldon: No, she won\xe2\x80\x99t. I\xe2\x80\x99m great.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nHoward: Okay, I have now officially moved out of my mother\xe2\x80\x99s house. You are now the only woman in my life who I\xe2\x80\x99ll see naked in the bathroom.\nBernadette: I know this wasn\xe2\x80\x99t easy. You doing okay?\nHoward: Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m fine. It\xe2\x80\x99s just her I\xe2\x80\x99m worried about.\nBernadette: Aw, she\xe2\x80\x99ll be okay. She\xe2\x80\x99s a grown woman.\nHoward: I know. It\xe2\x80\x99s just ever since my dad left, I\xe2\x80\x99ve felt responsible for her.\nBernadette: That\xe2\x80\x99s a lot for a kid to deal with.\nHoward: She was just so sad all the time. I was the only person who could cheer her up. Well, me and Ben and Jerry.\nBernadette: She\xe2\x80\x99s lucky you were there.\nHoward: You know, she\xe2\x80\x99s why I first got into magic. I would do little shows for her, hang up a bedsheet like it was a curtain, put on a top hat and cape. And part way through the act, I would say I needed a volunteer from the audience to be my beautiful assistant and invite her up on stage. I can still remember the way she\xe2\x80\x99d smile. For a few minutes, she\xe2\x80\x99d forget how lonely she was.\nBernadette: Aw, crap. Let\xe2\x80\x99s go.\nHoward: Where we going?\nBernadette: Grab a box. We\xe2\x80\x99ll sleep at your mother\xe2\x80\x99s place tonight.\nHoward: No, but I want to live here.\nBernadette: Well, you should\xe2\x80\x99ve thought of that before you told me the stupid magic trick story.\nHoward: Can\xe2\x80\x99t we talk about this?\nBernadette: No husband of mine is gonna break his mother\xe2\x80\x99s heart!\nScene: Wil Wheaton\xe2\x80\x99s house.\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Wil Wheaton! (Knock, knock, knock) Wil Wheaton! Wait, how many was that?\nWil: Hey, Sheldon, what\xe2\x80\x99s up?\nSheldon: Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you like to know?\nWil: Have you been drinking?\nSheldon: Just tea. S\xe2\x80\x99the best tea I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever had.\nWil: Why are you here?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you. I\xe2\x80\x99m from Texas. Need I say more?\nWil: Yeah, actually, a little more would be helpful.\nSheldon: You insulted my woman. I\xe2\x80\x99m here to defend her honour. Two! It was two. (Knock, knock, knock) Wil Wheaton! Now prepare yourself for what may come.\nWil: Oh, Sheldon, do you really think we\xe2\x80\x99re gonna fight?\nSheldon: My fists are not up here because I\xe2\x80\x99m milking a giant invisible cow. They\xe2\x80\x99re up to beat an apology out of you.\nWil: Okay, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.\nSheldon: Well, that was a long bus ride for not very much.\nWil: Are you okay?\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re asking a lot of questions, Wil Wheaton. As a matter of idle curiosity, which of your shrubberies do you feel would benefit from a thorough vomiting? Never mind, I\xe2\x80\x99ll choose. (Vomits) You were so good in Stand by Me.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Hello, I\xe2\x80\x99m Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Welcome to Sheldon Cooper Presents Fun with Flags. Get ready for a very special episode where we explore the flags of the popular entertainment franchise, Star Trek. And to help us, I\xe2\x80\x99m pleased to introduce a special guest, surprisingly, it only took gas money and the promise of free food to get him here, Mr. LeVar Burton.\nLeVar: Hey, Sheldon, it\xe2\x80\x99s a pleasure to be here. Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got some interesting flags for\xe2\x80\xa6\nAmy: Cut. Yikes, this guy is worse than Wil Wheaton.\nSheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what she\xe2\x80\x99s talking about, but I\xe2\x80\x99m obligated to agree with her. She\xe2\x80\x99s my girlfriend.\nLeVar: Ah, I hear you, brother. I still get lunch, right?\nAdvertisements'
