b'Scene: (After a \xe2\x80\x9cpreviously on\xe2\x80\x9d sequence) A coffee shop\nRaj: So then I went to Cambridge, which was wonderful not only because it\xe2\x80\x99s a good school but because it totally looks like Hogwarts. That\xe2\x80\x99s where I fell in love with astronomy, and now I\xe2\x80\x99m an astrophysicist at Caltech, so I guess you could say, uh, Raj is my name and stars are my game. And rhyming is also my game. So, uh, two games. Uh, anyway, that, that\xe2\x80\x99s enough about me. I want to hear everything about you.\nGirl: I have to go to the bathroom.\nRaj: I go to the bathroom, too. Sometimes more frequently than I care to admit. Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99ve had it checked out, it\xe2\x80\x99s nothing. Hmm. This is going great. Mmm, can I have a refill on my chai tea? Yes, I have a good feeling about this. (Girl can be seen sneaking past window and leaving) I should have bought condoms.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Hello, I\xe2\x80\x99m Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Welcome to Sheldon Cooper Presents Fun with Flags. My apologies that this episode is coming late. I did shoot one last week, in honour of Black History Month, but I was informed by my roommate that my spot-on portrayal of George Washington Carver could be considered wildly racist. My heart goes out to the members of the African-American community, who, like me, have been kept down by The Man. Now, Fun with Flags is not just for the flag aficionado, it\xe2\x80\x99s also for the flag novice, so, to help me with that, please welcome my friend, neighbour, and flag virgin, yeah, not a real virgin. She\xe2\x80\x99s had coitus many times. Sometimes within earshot of this flag enthusiast. Once while he was trying to watch The Incredibles. Penny.\nPenny: Hello.\nSheldon: So, Penny, I understand you would like to learn more about flags.\nPenny: Yeah, I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell you how many times I\xe2\x80\x99ve been at a party where everyone\xe2\x80\x99s talking about flags and I just couldn\xe2\x80\x99t join in.\nSheldon: Yeah. Well, you came to the right place.\nPenny: Uh, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, can we just pause for a minute?\nSheldon: What\xe2\x80\x99s wrong?\nPenny: I just think it might look more natural if you talked to me instead of the camera, you know, like, like a real conversation. It\xe2\x80\x99s something we work on in my acting class.\nSheldon: Interesting. A few people in the comments section have said that my delivery is robotic. Perhaps that isn\xe2\x80\x99t the compliment it sounds like.\nPenny: Yeah, let\xe2\x80\x99s try it again, and maybe, this time, you could work on your body language a bit. You know, when you\xe2\x80\x99re all hunched like that, you\xe2\x80\x99re shutting the audience out, but when you\xe2\x80\x99re relaxed and open, you\xe2\x80\x99re inviting them in.\nSheldon: Right. And which one do I want?\nPenny: Let\xe2\x80\x99s try open.\nSheldon: If our friend, the flag, has taught me anything, it\xe2\x80\x99s to go where the wind takes you. As long as you remain firmly attached to a rigid pole. And, action. So, Penny, what sort of flag questions keep you awake at night?\nPenny: Um, well, I\xe2\x80\x99m from Nebraska. So what can you tell me about the state flag?\nSheldon: Gosh, Penny, what\xe2\x80\x99d you have for breakfast? A big glass of good question juice? The Nebraska state flag is simply the state seal on a field of blue. Spread your legs, invite them in.\nScene: Outside Raj\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m telling you, something\xe2\x80\x99s wrong. I can always feel it when Raj is in trouble.\nBernadette: Geez, how close were you guys before we got married?\nLeonard: Don\xe2\x80\x99t look under that rock. (Knocking) Raj, you okay?\nHoward: You in there?\nRaj (off): Go away!\nLeonard: Come on, buddy, open up.\nHoward: We\xe2\x80\x99re worried about you.\nRaj (off): Oh, just because I\xe2\x80\x99ve stopped going to work and answering my phone you think something bad happened? Maybe something good happened.\nBernadette: Did something good happen?\nRaj (off): Of course not. Nothing good ever happens. (Opens door. He is wearing a stained vest, his hair is unkempt, and he is drinking wine from a bottle.)\nLeonard: Whoa.\nRaj: What?\nLeonard: Nope, just, just, whoa.\nBernadette: It smells pretty ripe in here. You kind feel it in your eyes.\nLeonard: Raj, what\xe2\x80\x99s going on?\nRaj: I was humiliated by yet another woman.\nHoward: You didn\xe2\x80\x99t kill her and chop her up, that\xe2\x80\x99s not what we\xe2\x80\x99re smelling, right?\nRaj: No. I took her for coffee, and she snuck out the bathroom window to get away from me.\nBernadette: Oh, you poor baby.\nRaj: I went and looked. It was a high and tiny window. She must have been very motivated.\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. That\xe2\x80\x99s awful, but come on, you got to shake it off.\nLeonard: Yeah, you can\xe2\x80\x99t stay in your apartment for the rest of your life.\nRaj: Why not? With online shopping and overnight delivery, I can get anything I want. Look, I just ordered a case of Dinty Moore beef stew and two live lobsters on Amazon.\nLeonard: Lobsters overnight?\nHoward: Oh, you\xe2\x80\x99re kidding. Let me see. Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be. Look, you can throw in a couple steaks and have a surf and turf.\nLeonard: The surf and turf sounds good. See if they have corn on the cob.\nBernadette: Guys, we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to get him out of here, not you in.\nRaj: You\xe2\x80\x99re wasting your time. Just please, leave me alone.\nHoward: Now what?\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\nBernadette: We could go to Red Lobster and talk about it. We\xe2\x80\x99re all thinking it. I just had the decency to wait for him to leave.\nScene: The apartment.\nAmy (on webcam): Hello, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Hello. How\xe2\x80\x99s the final stage of your nicotine addiction study going?\nAmy: Fine. Just hold on. Mommy\xe2\x80\x99s on the phone! Sorry. We\xe2\x80\x99ve cut the monkeys down to one cigarette a day, so things are a little intense. Makes me miss my marijuana-abusing flatworms. Those guys were mellow.\nSheldon: Good news. Uh, the latest episode of Fun with Flags is online.\nAmy: Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s right. How\xe2\x80\x99d it go with Penny?\nSheldon: Much better than I expected. She even gave me some helpful tips about acting and body language. Watch. Welcome to my world. Not welcome to my world. Welcome. Not welcome.\nAmy: Subtle, but powerful.\nSheldon: I know. I\xe2\x80\x99m still learning to control it.\nAmy: Did you tell Penny how helpful she was?\nSheldon: Why would I do that?\nAmy: Because she\xe2\x80\x99s your friend, and she did a nice job. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure she\xe2\x80\x99d like to hear it.\nSheldon: All right.\nAmy: I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean now. Hello? Yeah, yeah, you want a cigarette. Well, I\xe2\x80\x99d like a normal boyfriend. Deal with it.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nPenny: Oh, hi. What\xe2\x80\x99s up?\nSheldon: Um\xe2\x80\xa6\nPenny: You need me to shut the door so you can do your knocking thing?\nSheldon: No. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t start yet, it\xe2\x80\x99s fine.\nPenny: Okay. So, what do you need?\nSheldon: Well, I was thinking about you helping me out last night (knock, knock, knock) Penny. And I just wanted to tell you (knock, knock, knock) Penny, that the answer to the question, who did a great job? is you, (knock, knock, knock) Penny.\nPenny: Really?\nSheldon: Yes, you were very natural in front of the camera, and I found your suggestions extremely helpful.\nPenny: Aw, sweetie, you just made my day.\nSheldon: Okay.\nPenny: Hey, my acting class is putting on a play Friday night. I could put you and Amy on the guest list.\nSheldon: Oh, that sounds terrible. Why would I want to do that?\nScene: The apartment.\nAmy (on webcam): That\xe2\x80\x99s right. They\xe2\x80\x99re no good without the lighter.\nSheldon: Well, so much for your advice on complimenting Penny.\nAmy: Why? What happened?\nSheldon: She tried to rope us into going to her acting class to see a play. Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry. Luckily, I had the good sense to drown that kitten in the river.\nAmy: Sheldon, that\xe2\x80\x99s very rude. She helped you with your show. The right thing to do is reciprocate by going to see her play.\nSheldon: Oh, so many crazy rules.\nAmy: That better be Tootsie Rolls you\xe2\x80\x99re throwing at me!\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. Oh yeah, much better.\nPenny: What?\nSheldon: Amy pointed out to me that since you did something nice for me, I\xe2\x80\x99m obligated to do something nice for you. So, yes, I\xe2\x80\x99ll go to your dopey play.\nPenny: Hey, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want you to go any more.\nSheldon: Why not?\nPenny: You should go \xe2\x80\x99cause you want to go, not because you have to.\nSheldon: Oh, Dear Lord, more rules? Where does it stop? Can I want to go because I have to want to go?\nPenny: Okay. Do whatever you want.\nSheldon: Yeah, but now, wait. Do whatever I want? Or whatever I have to want?\nPenny: Oh, for God\xe2\x80\x99s sake, just come to the play.\nSheldon: All right. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to, but at least that makes sense.\nScene: The comic book store.\nSheldon: You know, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen Raj in several days. Is he no longer a part of our social group? And if so, should we be interviewing for a replacement? Perhaps, this time, we go Latin.\nHoward: He\xe2\x80\x99s just decided he\xe2\x80\x99s never leaving his apartment again.\nSheldon: Oh, brilliant. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been itching to pull that trigger.\nHoward: He\xe2\x80\x99s upset because he can\xe2\x80\x99t get anywhere with women.\nSheldon: Would it help if I gave him some pointers? I\xe2\x80\x99m just funnin\xe2\x80\x99 ya.\nGirl: Hi. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if you remember me, but I was here the other night at your party.\nStuart: Oh, yeah, you left with Raj.\nGirl: Uh, yeah.\nHoward: You\xe2\x80\x99re the one? Okay, let me tell you something. That guy you blew off happens to be my best friend. Okay? He was devastated.\nGirl: Sorry. Can you just give him this?\nHoward: Okay. But I gotta warn you, Raj is a proud, passionate man. If you go running out on him again, you\xe2\x80\x99re only gonna get, like, three or four more chances before you are history.\nScene: Raj\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nHoward: Come on, she came back. This is good news. You should celebrate.\nRaj: I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to celebrate.\nHoward: Not even a little? I mean, we could have a pants party. Go put some on.\nRaj: Why would I want her number? I don\xe2\x80\x99t want anything to do with this woman.\nHoward: Oh, come on, Raj.\nRaj: No, you don\xe2\x80\x99t get it. I want nothing to do with any woman. My heart is stone. From now on, I\xe2\x80\x99m a monk. I renounce all worldly pleasures. Except for lobster. And garlic butter.\nHoward: Boy, I want to tell you it\xe2\x80\x99s her loss, but you are not making it easy.\nRaj: You\xe2\x80\x99re, you\xe2\x80\x99re a good friend for trying to help, but, I\xe2\x80\x99ve made my choice.\nHoward: All right. Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll see you around.\nRaj: See you. No, wait, take her number. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want the temptation.\nHoward: Okay.\nRaj: I must be strong so I don\xe2\x80\x99t stray from my true purpose, the study of the universe.\nHoward: All right. Thanks for ruining lobster for me.\nScene: Outside on the street.\nRaj: Wait! Give me the number! Give me the number! Give me the number!\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: So, Amy, what\xe2\x80\x99s going on with your addiction study?\nAmy: Sadly, I\xe2\x80\x99m no longer associated with that project.\nLeonard: Why? What happened?\nAmy: Typical bureaucratic nonsense. You can get animals addicted to a harmful substance, you can dissect their brains, but you throw their own faeces back at them and suddenly you\xe2\x80\x99re unprofessional.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. That I asked.\nSheldon: All right, let\xe2\x80\x99s get this stupid play over with.\nLeonard: Uh, hang on. Empty your pockets.\nSheldon: Why?\nLeonard: You know why. The Nintendo DS. And the PSP. Now the Gameboy.\nSheldon: Aw, for Pete\xe2\x80\x99s sake. Can we go now?\nLeonard: Well, is that all of it? (Pulls a Rubik\xe2\x80\x99s cube from his pants.) Just set it down.\nAmy: Just so you know, this is not a stupid play. A Streetcar Named Desire is an American classic.\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s about streetcars? Oh, great. I won\xe2\x80\x99t need this. (Pulls out an etch-a-sketch.)\nScene: Outside Raj\xe2\x80\x99s apartment. The girl from the comic book store knocks on the door.\nRaj: Just a sec. Oh, who says just a sec? I hate myself. Hello.\nGirl: Hi.\nRaj: Uh, would you like to come in?\nGirl: Oh, no, I can\xe2\x80\x99t stay.\nRaj: Oh.\nGirl: I just wanted to say, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry for running out of the coffee shop. That wasn\xe2\x80\x99t cool. So, uh, yeah. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.\nRaj: Wait. Can you at least tell me what went wrong? It\xe2\x80\x99s okay. I can take anything. Unless it\xe2\x80\x99s something I did, or said, or am. \xe2\x80\x98Cause those are, like, my buttons.\nGirl: No, it\xe2\x80\x99s not any of that. It\xe2\x80\x99s just, I kind of have a hard time around people I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\nRaj: Really? Then what were you doing at the comic book store that night?\nGirl: I\xe2\x80\x99ve been trying to force myself into situations that I\xe2\x80\x99m not comfortable with. I saw the flyer in the store window, and I made myself go in. I don\xe2\x80\x99t even like comic books.\nRaj: Yeah, me neither.\nGirl: Then what were you doing there?\nRaj: I lied. I love them. I only said that so you\xe2\x80\x99d go out with me.\nGirl: Oh, you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to do that. I\xe2\x80\x99m kind of broken.\nRaj: That\xe2\x80\x99s great. I\xe2\x80\x99m broken, too.\nGirl: Oh, no, you\xe2\x80\x99re not.\nRaj: Oh, I totally am. If it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t for this beer, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t even talk to you right now. I\xe2\x80\x99m a wreck. There are many things seriously wrong with me. And not quirks, either. Like, diagnosable psychological problems. Maybe brain damage.\nGirl: Well, how do I know you\xe2\x80\x99re not just saying that?\nRaj: Go out with me on one date, and I promise you, you\xe2\x80\x99ll see.\nGirl: Okay. Text me. Bye.\nRaj: You won\xe2\x80\x99t regret it. I\xe2\x80\x99m the most pathetic guy you\xe2\x80\x99ve ever met. And that, boys and girls, is how it\xe2\x80\x99s done.\nScene: The theatre.\nPenny (as Blanche DuBois) : You love her very much, don\xe2\x80\x99t you?\nActor (as Mitch): Yes.\nPenny: I think you have a great capacity for devotion. You\xe2\x80\x99ll be lonely when she passes on, won\xe2\x80\x99t you? I understand what that is.\nActor: To be lonely?\nLeonard: She\xe2\x80\x99s pretty good, huh?\nSheldon: She is. But when do they get to the part about streetcars?\nPenny (as Blanche): \xe2\x80\xa6when I was a very young girl. When I was 16 years old, I made the discovery, love. All at once, and much, much too completely. It was like you suddenly turned a blinding light on something that had always been half a shadow. That\xe2\x80\x99s how it struck the world for me. But I was unlucky. Deluded.\nSheldon: She\xe2\x80\x99s remarkable.\nLeonard: She really is.\nAmy: Our Penny\xe2\x80\x99s a star.\nSheldon: How can she remember all those lines, but as a waitress, she can\xe2\x80\x99t remember no tomato on my hamburger?\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
