b'Scene: The lobby.\nSheldon: Two one six four two zero one nine eight nine. And that, little lady, is pi to a thousand places.\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99d say I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry I asked, except I didn\xe2\x80\x99t.\nSheldon: Oh, look, it\xe2\x80\x99s the Scientific American that covered the paper Leonard and I wrote.\nAmy: Oh, let me see.\nSheldon: I have mixed feelings about doing interviews. I like the part where I talk. I do not like the part where the other man talks.\nAmy: Sheldon, this article doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mention Leonard at all.\nSheldon: Well, that can\xe2\x80\x99t be right.\nAmy: It only refers to Dr. Cooper and his team. Did you even talk about him?\nSheldon: All I did was answer a few questions about the theory. And then expressed my gratitude that Scientific American doesn\xe2\x80\x99t include any of those smelly perfume cards.\nAmy: Poor Leonard.\nSheldon: Why? The theory he came up with just got mentioned in Scientific American. He ought to be thrilled.\nAmy: He might not be.\nSheldon: Oh, maybe you\xe2\x80\x99re right. He is kind of a lump.\nAmy: Think about it. How would you feel if you were referred to as part of Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s team?\nSheldon: Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99d be incensed.\nAmy: So you see what I\xe2\x80\x99m getting at?\nSheldon: Squeaky wheel gets the grease?\nAmy: No.\nSheldon: Grass is always greener?\nAmy: Try again.\nSheldon: Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, we\xe2\x80\x99re all Groot? Just tell me.\nAmy: Leonard is as much a part of this paper as you are, and he was overlooked. He\xe2\x80\x99s going to feel bad.\nSheldon: But it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t my fault. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t exclude him. And I didn\xe2\x80\x99t write the article.\nAmy: Remember that time you didn\xe2\x80\x99t get picked to pull the sword out of the stone at Disneyland and they let that other kid do it?\nSheldon: Oh, that kid. Poor Leonard.\nAmy: Exactly.\nSheldon: For the record, that kid was a terrible choice. If you cry when you drop your churro, you do not have what it takes to rule England.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: Howard\xe2\x80\x99s car.\nHoward: Thanks for helping us sort through all my mom\xe2\x80\x99s stuff.\nRaj: Of course. I know what it\xe2\x80\x99s like having to go through a loved one\xe2\x80\x99s possessions. My uncle was a worshipper of Krishna. But after he died, you know what we found? A statue of Shiva. It may not be Crips and Bloods, okay? But in India, it\xe2\x80\x99s a thing.\nBernadette: Well, it\xe2\x80\x99ll be good that you\xe2\x80\x99re there. Howard\xe2\x80\x99s been having trouble deciding what to keep and what to let go.\nHoward: Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard. A lot of Ma\xe2\x80\x99s stuff brings back fond memories.\nBernadette: Is that why you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get rid of her drawer full of ketchup packets?\nHoward: Yes. It reminds me of us eating out and her saying quick, nobody\xe2\x80\x99s looking, fill your pockets with ketchup.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Leonard? Have you ever noticed that only my name is on the cable bill?\nLeonard: Yeah.\nSheldon: Good, good. And your name is on the electric bill and mine isn\xe2\x80\x99t. And I\xe2\x80\x99m okay with that.\nLeonard: Actually, your name is on the electric bill.\nSheldon: Oh, right. This is a disaster.\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t even know what you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about and I agree.\nSheldon: Okay, I have to tell you something, but you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to like it.\nLeonard: What\xe2\x80\x99s going on?\nSheldon: An article was just published in Scientific American about our theory.\nLeonard: Did they hate it?\nSheldon: No. No, they loved it. They, uh, couldn\xe2\x80\x99t say enough nice things about it.\nLeonard: So what\xe2\x80\x99s the problem?\nSheldon: You know how the PennySaver only has my name\xe2\x80\xa6\nLeonard: Sheldon.\nSheldon: They didn\xe2\x80\x99t mention you in the article. Only me.\nLeonard: Really?\nSheldon: I know. It\xe2\x80\x99s not fair. Let the anger go, buddy. You just, you relax all your muscles. Except for your pubococcygeus and anal sphincter. Let\xe2\x80\x99s keep those tight.\nLeonard: Uh, that, that\xe2\x80\x99s not necessary.\nSheldon: It is. They\xe2\x80\x99re what hold back the urine and the faeces. Look, maybe, maybe you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t read it. It\xe2\x80\x99ll only make you feel worse.\nLeonard: Cooper and his team?\nSheldon: You should know I had nothing to do with that.\nLeonard: Uh, at least they\xe2\x80\x99re talking about the theory. I mean, that\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x99s important.\nSheldon: You know, you\xe2\x80\x99re right. Yeah. You know, it\xe2\x80\x99s like when Stan Lee and Steve Ditko created Spider-Man. Stan Lee may get all the credit, but Steve Ditko knows he was just as important. Even though Stan Lee gets to be in all the Marvel movies. And. and he\xe2\x80\x99s far richer. And he\xe2\x80\x99s a household name, you know? Whereas, you know, you say Ditko, and that sounds like a company that makes Dits.\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99s not helping.\nSheldon: Well, I\xe2\x80\x99d give more examples, but, well, everyone in your position\xe2\x80\x99s so forgettable.\nScene: Mrs Wolowitz\xe2\x80\x99s House.\nHoward: Stuart, we\xe2\x80\x99re here.\nRaj: It\xe2\x80\x99s nice of you to let him keep staying at your mom\xe2\x80\x99s house.\nHoward: Yeah, well, I tried putting him out on the curb, but nobody took him.\nStuart: Hey. Just so you know, the power\xe2\x80\x99s out.\nBernadette: What happened?\nStuart: I called, they said a transformer blew. It\xe2\x80\x99s the whole block. Should be fixed by tomorrow.\nHoward: Wait, when did it go out?\nStuart: In the middle of the night.\nHoward: Oh, my God.\nBernadette: Howie, what\xe2\x80\x99s wrong?\nHoward: It\xe2\x80\x99s all defrosting.\nBernadette: It\xe2\x80\x99s okay. It\xe2\x80\x99s just food.\nHoward: It\xe2\x80\x99s not just food. This is the last food my mother ever made. This is her last brisket. This is her last meatloaf. This is her last. I have no idea what this is, but it\xe2\x80\x99s the last one.\nRaj: Everything okay?\nHoward: No. All Ma\xe2\x80\x99s food is gonna be ruined.\nBernadette: Well, why don\xe2\x80\x99t we take it home and put it in our freezer?\nRaj: You don\xe2\x80\x99t want to do that. Refreezing not only removes moisture, but it creates ice crystals in the fibres of the meat that can compromise its taste and texture. What? I saw a teachable moment. I dropped some culinary science.\nBernadette: What should we do?\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you exactly what we\xe2\x80\x99re gonna do. We\xe2\x80\x99re gonna eat it.\nBernadette: There\xe2\x80\x99s, like, twenty pounds of food in there.\nHoward: All you said was I had to get rid of things. You didn\xe2\x80\x99t say they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t pass through my colon first.\nBernadette: Howie.\nHoward: Okay. Then how about this? Let\xe2\x80\x99s invite everyone over to dinner. It\xe2\x80\x99ll be like Ma\xe2\x80\x99s feeding us one last time.\nBernadette: I love that.\nRaj: Me, too. Oh, look, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got enough ketchup to cover every ounce of it.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nPenny: I mean, who even reads Scientific American?\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s kind of a big deal.\nPenny: If it\xe2\x80\x99s such a big deal, how come the biggest celebrity they could get for the cover is a molecule?\nLeonard: Can we please just stop talking about it?\nPenny: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. What can I do?\nLeonard: Nothing, I\xe2\x80\x99m fine.\nPenny: No, no. I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna cheer you up. Here we go.\nLeonard: What are we doing?\nPenny: I am taking you shopping.\nLeonard: Oh.\nPenny: My baby is sad, and I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna make him happy again.\nLeonard: Look, I know shopping cheers you up, but it\xe2\x80\x99s just not really my thing.\nPenny: Well, what about this helicopter you control with an iPad?\nLeonard: Does it have a camera in it?\nPenny: It does have a camera in it.\nLeonard: Baby\xe2\x80\x99s listening.\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard? (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard? (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard?\nLeonard: What?\nSheldon: I spoke to the reporter at the magazine.\nLeonard: What happened? Did you tell him it was my idea?\nSheldon: I did.\nLeonard: Thank you. What did he say?\nSheldon: He said they made the editorial decision to only cite the lead scientist.\nLeonard: Why did he think you\xe2\x80\x99re the lead scientist? It was my idea.\nPenny: You know, for an extra four bucks, I can have this thing here tomorrow.\nSheldon: Well, I know it was your idea, but the reporter said he\xe2\x80\x99s been following my work for a while, and the only reason they even mentioned it in the magazine is \xe2\x80\x99cause my name is on it.\nPenny: You know what? I did it. What\xe2\x80\x99s four bucks?\nLeonard: If you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to make me feel better, it\xe2\x80\x99s not working.\nSheldon: Well then what if I told you that I added your name to the cable bill?\nLeonard: No.\nSheldon: Oh. That\xe2\x80\x99s just as well. They had me on hold for 20 minutes and I hung up. (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard? (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard? (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard? Also, Wolowitz invited us all to dinner, so I\xe2\x80\x99m ready whenever you are.\nScene: Amy\xe2\x80\x99s car.\nSheldon: All he had was an idea.\nAmy: Well, that is an important part.\nSheldon: Oh, please. I have ideas all day long. Reverse SeaWorld where dolphins are allowed to pet people. A new clothing size between medium and large called Marge. Snow White retold from the point of view of Sneezy. Why won\xe2\x80\x99t Doc prescribe him something? We finally find out.\nAmy: But Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s idea was good.\nSheldon: Fine. Then Grumpy, what\xe2\x80\x99s he so grumpy about? Maybe his girlfriend won\xe2\x80\x99t take his side.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s car.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m the one who thought of it.\nPenny: Well, didn\xe2\x80\x99t he do a lot of the work?\nLeonard: Yeah. But now he\xe2\x80\x99s happy to let people think he\xe2\x80\x99s responsible for everything.\nPenny: And that\xe2\x80\x99s why you get an iPad helicopter.\nScene: Amy\xe2\x80\x99s car.\nSheldon: Is it my fault I have a much bigger reputation than he does?\nAmy: It\xe2\x80\x99s not your fault.\nSheldon: Is it my fault that my name came first on the paper alphabetically?\nAmy: Not your fault.\nSheldon: Is it my fault that when the reporter cited me as the lead scientist I didn\xe2\x80\x99t correct him?\nAmy: Hey, look at that pretty bird.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s car.\nLeonard: He always needs all the attention. He\xe2\x80\x99s such a baby.\nPenny: I know, I know.\nLeonard: I swear, he is never ever playing with my helicopter.\nScene: Mrs Wolowitz\xe2\x80\x99s kitchen.\nRaj: Okay, I\xe2\x80\x99ll start heating some of this stuff up.\nBernadette: Thanks.\nHoward: Oh, man. This is the boutonniere from my high school prom. A piece of cake from my Bar Mitzvah.\nBernadette: Did she throw anything away?\nHoward: No. If I find my foreskin, I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna kill myself.\nRaj: Okay, so we\xe2\x80\x99ve got, um, three briskets, four meatloafs, one lasagna.\nHoward: No, that\xe2\x80\x99s noodle kugel.\nRaj: One Jewish lasagna, two pound cakes that are about eight pounds each, and one giant container of matzoh ball soup.\nHoward: Ma always kept it on hand, in case I got sick. She thought she could cure anything with her cooking. Even the time I got food poisoning. From her cooking.\nBernadette: You okay?\nHoward: Yeah, I\xe2\x80\x99m okay. Let\xe2\x80\x99s get started.\nRaj: You got it.\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m never gonna talk to her again.\nBernadette: Should we tell everyone not to come?\nHoward: No. I want to do this.\nBernadette: Okay. Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll keep it together if you can.\nHoward: Okay.\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99m not making any promises.\nScene: Mrs Wolowitz\xe2\x80\x99s living room.\nStuart: Glad you guys could make it.\nLeonard: Of course.\nPenny: Wow, it looks really pretty in here.\nStuart: Yeah, turns out half a dozen menorahs really sets a mood.\nLeonard: So, Stuart, have you thought about what you\xe2\x80\x99d do if Howard sells the house?\nStuart: And there goes the mood.\nSheldon: Hi. Hello. Oh, and a special hello to Leonard, who needs to be mentioned by name.\nLeonard: Subtle.\nSheldon: But you got it, right?\nHoward: Hey, guys.\nAll: Hey. Hi. Hello.\nHoward: I just want everyone to know, uh, tonight\xe2\x80\x99s not a sad occasion.\nBernadette: Yeah, we just want to have the kind of dinner that we\xe2\x80\x99ve all had here so many times before.\nHoward: Good food, good friends, and sometime around midnight, heartburn that makes you pray for death.\nAmy: Do you need any help in the kitchen?\nBernadette: No, we got it. You guys make yourselves comfortable.\nPenny: All right, hey, you two, we\xe2\x80\x99re here for Howard right now, okay?\nAmy: Yes, so please behave yourselves.\nLeonard: Fine.\nSheldon: Of course.\nStuart: So I heard you two, uh, wrote a paper together. How\xe2\x80\x99s that going?\nScene: Mrs Wolowitz\xe2\x80\x99s dining room.\nPenny: This food is amazing.\nRaj: Mm, and not a vegetable in sight.\nHoward: That\xe2\x80\x99s not true. We\xe2\x80\x99ve got tomatoes right here.\nAmy: All these bright people sitting around a table by candlelight. Feels like we could be an 18th century French salon.\nSheldon: Indeed. Penny, a salon is a gathering where intellectuals entertained each other with sparkling conversations about issues of the day.\nPenny: Oh, so it\xe2\x80\x99s like The View.\nAmy: Sheldon, The View is a daytime talk show hosted by women.\nSheldon: Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m aware. It features Whoopi Goldberg. She played Guinan on Star Trek: Next Gen. Penny, Next Gen refers to Star Trek\xe2\x80\xa6\nPenny: Shut up.\nRaj: I would like to propose a salon topic.\nAmy: Ooh, please do, Rajesh.\nRaj: The lead in The Hunger Games is a woman. Marvel has made Tor a female.\nPenny: Wait, who\xe2\x80\x99s Tor?\nRaj: You know, Tor, the God of Tunder. As I was saying, is this a sign that our society is approaching gender equality?\nHoward: Certainly a lot more women are reading comic books now.\nStuart: It\xe2\x80\x99s true. At the store, I had to put a seat on the toilet.\nAmy: We won\xe2\x80\x99t know if there\xe2\x80\x99s equality until female Thor has a baby and the Avengers are cool with her pumping breast milk at work.\nHoward: I wonder if only a baby who is worthy can suckle at the bosom of Thor.\nPenny: Okay, new salon topic. Salons, dumb thing from a long time ago or interesting thing made dumb by talking about superheroes? Discuss.\nSheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe it matters what the topic is. What\xe2\x80\x99s crucial for a salon is that we conduct the discussion in an elevated and insightful way. It\xe2\x80\x99s all about the execution.\nLeonard: Of course you\xe2\x80\x99d focus on that rather than the inspiration. Uh, new salon topic. What\xe2\x80\x99s more important, an idea or its execution?\nBernadette: Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s fine.\nSheldon: Yeah, good for you, Leonard. That\xe2\x80\x99s a lovely little notion. Kind of like, I wish I could talk to my uncle in Chicago. Yeah, now stand back while I invent the telephone. Hello? Oh, hold on. Leonard, it\xe2\x80\x99s your uncle. He says you just got burned.\nAmy: Sheldon.\nPenny: Guys.\nLeonard: No, it\xe2\x80\x99s okay. We\xe2\x80\x99re all adults trying to have an intelligent discussion. At least I am. Howard, what do you think?\nHoward: Well, I guess, as an engineer, I lean towards execution. I spend my days trying to take ideas and make them real.\nSheldon: Well said, old chap. I thought eloquence had died, here it stands before us. Starting today, it\xe2\x80\x99ll go Gettysburg Address, I have a dream, and what he just said.\nLeonard: Oh, now he\xe2\x80\x99s a genius? All you ever do is make fun of him and engineering.\nSheldon: Leonard, please. His mother just died.\nLeonard: You\xe2\x80\x99re being ridiculous.\nSheldon: Yeah, so are you.\nPenny: Guys, if I wanted to hear people be bitchy, I\xe2\x80\x99d go to my real salon.\nSheldon: Leonard, lots of people could\xe2\x80\x99ve had that idea, but very few people could\xe2\x80\x99ve worked out the math the way I did.\nLeonard: Lots of people also didn\xe2\x80\x99t have that idea, like everyone in the entire world except for me.\nSheldon: Oh, well, apparently Leonard thinks he\xe2\x80\x99s better than everyone in the whole world, including those fighting for our freedom. Yeah, well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know about you, but I support our boys overseas.\nAmy: And girls.\nSheldon: Hey, you already ruined Thor, give it a rest.\nLeonard: So I\xe2\x80\x99m just supposed to be okay with you hogging all the credit?\nSheldon: I didn\xe2\x80\x99t hog anything. Unlike you and that weird lasagna with raisins in it.\nLeonard: You want some of this? I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you some.\nBernadette: Hey. Sheldon, Leonard, living room, right now!\nSheldon: She said my name first, that must kill you.\nBernadette (off): I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you think you\xe2\x80\x99re doing, but this is a very difficult time for my husband. We\xe2\x80\x99re eating the last food his mother ever made, and you were gonna throw it at each other like children? Whatever it is you\xe2\x80\x99re fighting about, put it aside, go back in there and be a good friend to Howard or there\xe2\x80\x99s no dessert for either of you. Look at me when I\xe2\x80\x99m talking to you. And don\xe2\x80\x99t think\xe2\x80\xa6\nHoward: You guys ever notice sometimes Bernadette sounds like my mom?\nAmy: I don\xe2\x80\x99t hear it.\nRaj: No, not at all.\nScene: Mrs Wolowitz\xe2\x80\x99s living room.\nPenny: I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I\xe2\x80\x99ve eaten that much in my entire life.\nHoward: It\xe2\x80\x99s why my people wandered the desert for 40 years. Took that long to walk it off.\nSheldon: You see, Penny, the Israelites were in the desert\xe2\x80\xa6\nPenny: Shut up.\nRa: So glad you two are done fighting.\nLeonard: Right now, I\xe2\x80\x99m just trying to burp without throwing up.\nSheldon: Hang on. Physics Today mentioned the paper.\nStuart: What\xe2\x80\x99d they say?\nAmy: Who cares? Did they mention Leonard?\nSheldon: They did.\nAll: Yay.\nBernadette: Good news, I found more Tums.\nAll: Yay.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
