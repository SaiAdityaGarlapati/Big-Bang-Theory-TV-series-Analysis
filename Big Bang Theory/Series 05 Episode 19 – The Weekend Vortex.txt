b'Scene: The stairwell\nRaj: Hey, want to spend some time playing the new Star Wars game this weekend?\nLeonard: Oh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I kind of promised myself I\xe2\x80\x99d get off the computer, be more physically active. Get some exercise.\nHoward: You\xe2\x80\x99re about to walk up three flights of stairs.\nLeonard: Good point, I\xe2\x80\x99m in.\nRaj: You know what would be great? Let\xe2\x80\x99s do it like the old days.\nLeonard: You mean, are you talking gaming marathon?\nRaj: Yeah. Start Saturday morning, go 48 hours, sleeping bags, junk food.\nHoward: Turn off our phones so our moms can\xe2\x80\x99t call.\nLeonard: It would be like our World Of Warcraft a few years ago when the neighbours called the cops on us.\nHoward: They called the cops because of the smell. They thought we were dead.\nRaj: We were badass back in the day.\nLeonard: All right, let\xe2\x80\x99s do it.\nHoward: 48 hours of Star Wars gaming.\nRaj: It\xe2\x80\x99s on like Alderaan.\nLeonard: Hey, Sheldon, clear your weekend. Starting Saturday morning, Star Wars< marathon\nRaj: Woo-hoo!\nSheldon: Movies or video games? Or board game? Or trading card games? Or Lego\xe2\x80\x99s? Or dress up? Or comic books? Or dramatic readings of novelizations? Yes to all!\nLeonard: We are going to play the online game.\nSheldon: The online game? Bully!\nAmy: Gentlemen, as much as I\xe2\x80\x99m sure Sheldon would enjoy playing intergalactic make-believe, he and I have other plans. We are attending my Aunt Flora\xe2\x80\x99s 93rd birthday party.\nSheldon: Just tell her I can\xe2\x80\x99t come.\nAmy: She\xe2\x80\x99ll be disappointed if we don\xe2\x80\x99t show up.\nSheldon: She\xe2\x80\x99s 93. She won\xe2\x80\x99t be disappointed for very long.\nAmy: No, hang on. I followed all the protocols set forth by you in the relationship agreement. I made a written record request 72 hours in advance. I checked the tyre pressure on the car. I even contacted the Centres For Disease Control to find out what shots they recommend for travel to Orange County. FYI, it\xe2\x80\x99s none.\nSheldon: Amy, the relationship agreement was not designed for either one of us to get our way.\nAmy: You use it to get your way.\nSheldon: I use it to get the right way. The fact that the right way is also my way is a happy coincidence.\nAmy: You gave me your word. You\xe2\x80\x99re coming with me.\nLeonard: We\xe2\x80\x99ll miss you, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Yeah, well, who wants to spend the whole weekend, running around a bunch of pretend planets battling made up monsters. That\xe2\x80\x99s for babies.\nHoward: Yeah, but it\xe2\x80\x99s got lightsabres.\nSheldon: Yeah, please, Amy! It\xe2\x80\x99s got lightsabres!\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The comic book store.\nSheldon: Hello Stuart.\nStuart: Hey Sheldon. Help you with anything?\nSheldon: Yes. I\xe2\x80\x99m attending a party this weekend, for a 93-year-old woman. Can you recommend a gift?\nStuart: Uh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Could put a tennis ball on the end of Excalibur. Make a pretty badass cane.\nSheldon: Do you supply the the tennis ball?\nStuart: No.\nSheldon: Then no. What else?\nStuart: Hmm. Oh, have this collectors edition Batman utility belt. Maybe she can use it as a wearable pill caddy.\nSheldon: Well, she\xe2\x80\x99d just look silly wearing that without the rest of the costume.\nStuart: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry Sheldon, that\xe2\x80\x99s it. That\xe2\x80\x99s all I got.\nSheldon: Oh, it\xe2\x80\x99s not your fault. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been to the model train store. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been to Radio Shack. This woman is impossible to shop for.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99d make fun of Sheldon for having girl problems if I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t in shock that Sheldon has girl problems.\nSheldon: No, Leonard, go ahead and mock. Like my daddy always said, Shelly, women aren\xe2\x80\x99t anything but flippin\xe2\x80\x99 pains in the bottom.\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99s what your father used to say?\nSheldon: Well, I took out the bad words and the yeehaw, but you get the gist.\nHoward: Look, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to go to the party, just don\xe2\x80\x99t go. You\xe2\x80\x99re a grown man. Act like one. Tell Amy you want to spend the weekend having a sleepover and playing video games with your friends. Maybe she\xe2\x80\x99ll dig it. Women like a firm hand on the tiller.\nRaj: I can never find the tiller. I got a book; it didn\xe2\x80\x99t help.\nSheldon: Yeah, I always thought if I were ever enslaved, it would be by an advanced species from another planet, not some hotsy-totsy from Glendale.\nHoward: Now, I downloaded an app that might be helpful in this situation. (Phone makes whip sound)\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re right. I\xe2\x80\x99m smart as a whip. I should be able to figure this out.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nLeonard: Hey, listen, I kind of made plans with the guys this weekend, but then I wondered, because we\xe2\x80\x99re in this relationship-beta-test, if I should have asked you first. Then I thought if I did check with you first, you\xe2\x80\x99d think that I was taking things to seriously. And then, then I got a nosebleed.\nPenny: You don\xe2\x80\x99t have to check with me. Do whatever you want.\nLeonard: Oh. I guess I was hoping for a different reaction, but okay.\nPenny: Really, what were you hoping for?\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, maybe that you\xe2\x80\x99d be a little upset, and then you\xe2\x80\x99d realize that I\xe2\x80\x99m a stallion that has to run free. And that would turn you on a little.\nPenny: Okay, I\xe2\x80\x99m an actress. Ask me again.\nLeonard: Do you mind if I spend the weekend playing video games with the guys?\nPenny: Whu\xe2\x80\xa6 the entire weekend? You mean I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t see you at all? But I ju\xe2\x80\xa6 No, no, I knew what I was getting into. You can\xe2\x80\x99t put a saddle on Leonard Hofstadter. Oh, my, is it getting hot in here? Ay, papi.\nLeonard: Ay papi? What is that?\nPenny: An acting choice.\nLeonard: Oh. So you chose that when you become turned on, you turn into Speedy Gonzalez?\nPenny: Choo got a problem with that, papi?\nLeonard: Uh-uh.\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Penny! (Knock, knock, knock) Penny! (Knock, knock, knock) Penny!\nPenny: Sorry, Stallion. Your weird friend Giraffe is here.\nSheldon: Hello, Penny. I just stopped by to bring you this gift.\nPenny: Gummy bears? Thank you.\nSheldon: Now that you\xe2\x80\x99re in my debt, please manipulate Amy into releasing me from my commitment to attend her aunt\xe2\x80\x99s tedious birthday party.\nPenny: Not a chance.\nSheldon: All right. I thought the candy might not be enough so let me up the ante. These are Cooper Coupons. These are for various things I can do for you. Um, oh, this one is for one free grammar check. Uh, you could use it for emails, letters, tattoos, what have you. Um, oh, this is fun one. This is an afternoon with me at the California Science Center, where I point out their mistakes.\nLeonard: Keep an eye on those expiration dates, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been burned more than once.\nPenny: All right, sweetie, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get involved in your relationship.\nSheldon: Oh, come on. It\xe2\x80\x99s just a simple favour. Now, when\xe2\x80\x99s the last time I asked you to do something for me?\nPenny: Yesterday. You made me look in your ear to see if there was a ladybug in it.\nSheldon: When is the last time I asked you to do something that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a medical emergency?\nPenny: Yesterday. You made me look in your ear to see if there was a ladybug in it.\nSheldon: All right, then, I have no choice but to go on to plan B.\nPenny: What\xe2\x80\x99s that?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m going to run around outside with a wet head and try to catch a cold.\nScene: Amy\xe2\x80\x99s car.\nAmy: Good morning.\nSheldon: Hello.\nAmy: I think you\xe2\x80\x99re really going to enjoy yourself today. Not only do you get to meet my relatives, but since my aunt\xe2\x80\x99s nursing home is catering the party, all of the food is incredibly soft. It\xe2\x80\x99s like a vacation for your teeth.\nSheldon: All right.\nAmy: You sure you\xe2\x80\x99re okay with this?\nSheldon: Yes. I decided to find a way that I could have this experience and enjoy it.\nAmy: Thank you. That means a lot to me.\nSheldon: Oh, don\xe2\x80\x99t thank me. Thank wireless technology. I realized, I can go to your aunt\xe2\x80\x99s awful party and still spend the whole day gaming with my friends.\nAmy: Sheldon, my relatives are going to want to talk to you, and you\xe2\x80\x99re going to be sitting there playing a game? Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that a little rude?\nSheldon: Oh, I got that covered. Headset. I won\xe2\x80\x99t hear a word the old geezers are saying.\nAmy: You know, if playing that game is more important to you than honouring your commitment to me, and you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind me showing up at a party all by myself after I\xe2\x80\x99ve already told everybody I\xe2\x80\x99ll be bringing somebody, then, fine. Go home and play your game.\nSheldon: Thanks. Ooh, listen, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t mind a piece of birthday cake, provided the old gal\xe2\x80\x99s candle blow is clean and dry.\nScene: The apartment.\nRaj: Here you go. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got everything we\xe2\x80\x99ll need for the big game. Low fat turkey jerky, low-carb beer, 100-calorie snack packs.\nLeonard: You pick up a Y chromosome while you were there? You might be short one.\nRaj: Hey, I plan on levelling up in the game, not my swimsuit size, thank you very much.\nSheldon: Gentlemen, the game offers us a choice between playing for the Republic and the light side, or the Sith Empire and the dark side.\nLeonard: Well, we\xe2\x80\x99re always the good guys. In D&D, we\xe2\x80\x99re lawful good, in City Of Heroes, we\xe2\x80\x99re the heroes, in Grand Theft Auto, we pay the prostitutes promptly and never hit them with a bat.\nSheldon: Those women are prostitutes? You said they were raising money for stem cell research.\nHoward: Hey, guys, I got a surprise.\nLeonard: Uh, if it\xe2\x80\x99s yoghurt that helps ladies poop, I think Raj beat you to it.\nHoward: No. Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s going to be playing with us. So, that\xe2\x80\x99s pretty cool, huh? Right? Sure it is, yeah.\nRaj: What, you invited your girlfriend? This is supposed to be our weekend.\nHoward: I had no choice. Last night, she said, why don\xe2\x80\x99t we go out for brunch tomorrow and then maybe the Arboretum. And I said, well, no, I promised the guys I was going to play a video game with them all weekend. And she said, that sounds like fun, can I come, too? And then I didn\xe2\x80\x99t answer for a second, and then she said, well, do you not want me to come? And then I bought her a new laptop and the game, and she\xe2\x80\x99s parking the car right now.\nSheldon: Is the whip sound app contextually appropriate here?\nLeonard: Uh, it is, but I think you might\xe2\x80\x99ve waited too long for it to be funny. (Whip sound) I was wrong, it\xe2\x80\x99s still funny.\nSheldon: Oh, good. Hah-hah!\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nPenny: Amy, what\xe2\x80\x99s wrong?\nAmy: My boyfriend\xe2\x80\x99s a jerk.\nPenny: Well, I know he didn\xe2\x80\x99t cheat on you, so what happened?\nAmy: I had to go to my aunt\xe2\x80\x99s party all by myself, and everybody was like, where\xe2\x80\x99s this boyfriend you\xe2\x80\x99re always talking about? Is he real, or did you make him up like Armin the miniature horse breeder?\nPenny: Who\xe2\x80\x99s Armin the miniature horse breeder?\nAmy: The pretend boyfriend I invented to get my family off my back. It unravelled quickly when I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t answer the question how\xe2\x80\x99d you two meet?\nPenny: I would have thought at a miniature horse show.\nAmy: Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s good.\nPenny: Mm.\nAmy: I panicked and said Woodstock. I just wanted to show Sheldon off to my family.\nPenny: Sure, I get that. I mean, he\xe2\x80\x99s your first boyfriend and all.\nAmy: Not just my first boyfriend, he\xe2\x80\x99s the best boyfriend. I mean, think about it. I\xe2\x80\x99m dating Sheldon Cooper.\nPenny: Yes. On purpose.\nAmy: He\xe2\x80\x99s handsome, he\xe2\x80\x99s lanky, he\xe2\x80\x99s brilliant, and his skin has that pale, waxy quality.\nPenny: Well, sickly is the new sexy.\nAmy: Yeah.\nPenny: Mm. You know, Amy, sometimes when you\xe2\x80\x99re in a relationship with someone you really care about, the sucky part is, it leaves you open to getting hurt.\nAmy: Do you ever worry about Leonard doing that to you?\nPenny: That\xe2\x80\x99s hilarious. No.\nScene: The apartment.\nBernadette: Get that guy! Get that guy! Pew! Pew! Pew! Pew!\nSheldon: Dr. Rostenkowski, it may interest you to know that saying pew, pew, pew isn\xe2\x80\x99t as effective as pressing your blaster key. In the same way that saying whee doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make the land speeder go.\nBernadette: Pew!\nLeonard: Raj, Imperial Troopers on your tail.\nRaj: Got him. When Gandhi advocated his philosophy of non-violence, I bet he didn\xe2\x80\x99t know how much fun it was killing stuff.\nLeonard: All right, I think we got them all. Let\xe2\x80\x99s divide up the loot.\nBernadette: Ooh, look at this pretty purple robe I just got. You should put on yours and then we\xe2\x80\x99ll match.\nHoward: But I worked hard to get this armour.\nBernadette: Sorry, I just thought it\xe2\x80\x99d be nice if people knew we were a couple.\nHoward: Fine, I\xe2\x80\x99ll change. (Whip sound)\nSheldon: Hah-hah!\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nAmy: I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I want to play a game.\nPenny: Oh, come on. They\xe2\x80\x99re playing one across the hall, we should, too. Okay, we are gonna take turns bouncing a quarter off the table, and if it goes into this cup, the other person has to drink. Then you get to go again\xe2\x80\xa6\nAmy: Like that?\nPenny: Wow. Yeah, b-beginner\xe2\x80\x99s luck. So, now I will drink this entire cup of beer, and you will go again and we can\xe2\x80\xa6 uh\xe2\x80\xa6 all right. So, yeah, okay, now I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna drink this entire cup and then I\xe2\x80\x99m going to drink another one\xe2\x80\xa6 Okay, seriously, stop. What the hell?\nAmy: Spent a lot of my childhood throwing coins into wishing wells hoping for friends. At a certain point, you start doing trick shots just to keep things interesting.\nPenny: Whoa, whoa, give me a second to catch up here. Hold on. (Sound of cheering)\nAmy: That\xe2\x80\x99d be my boyfriend. Happier playing his dopey Star Trek game with his friends than hanging out with me.\nPenny: Wars.\nAmy: What?\nPenny: Star Wars. They get all cranky when you mix the two up.\nAmy: What\xe2\x80\x99s the difference?\nPenny: There\xe2\x80\x99s absolutely no difference.\nAmy: How do I get him to treat me better?\nPenny: All right. Let me give you a little girlfriend 101. Usually the first move out of the gate is you withhold sex, but that will work better after Sheldon hits puberty. So, I\xe2\x80\x99d say give him the silent treatment.\nAmy: No, he loves that.\nPenny: Hmm.\nAmy: Our record for sitting in a room together and not speaking to each other is six-and-a half hours. He said it was a magical evening.\nPenny: All right, then we\xe2\x80\x99re gonna have to go with an oldie but goodie, making a scene.\nAmy: I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I\xe2\x80\x99d be good at that.\nPenny: That\xe2\x80\x99s why you\xe2\x80\x99re lucky to have me. Back in Omaha, there are two different restaurants I\xe2\x80\x99m not allowed into. Both Chili\xe2\x80\x99s.\nScene: The apartment.\nRaj: Bernadette, remember, your character\xe2\x80\x99s the healer in our group. You\xe2\x80\x99re in charge of healing all of us, not just Howard.\nBernadette: I can\xe2\x80\x99t help it. My Howie Wowie has an owie.\nSheldon: That is the most sickeningly sweet thing I have ever experienced. And I am sipping Kool-Aid through a Red Vine.\nAmy (bursting in): Sheldon Cooper, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a bone to pick with you, and I\xe2\x80\x99m about to do it in front of all your friends.\nPenny: Yeah, you pick that bone. You pick that bone clean!\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna publicly shame you, and then sit back as societal pressure compels you to modify your behaviour.\nPenny: Ooh, burn!\nAmy: And if you don\xe2\x80\x99t start treating me better, I\xe2\x80\x99m leaving you for a miniature horse breeder named Armin.\nSheldon: Armin who?\nAmy: Armin\xe2\x80\xa6 damn it.\nPenny: Sheldon, she wanted to show you off to her family, and you stood her up, okay? Look at this adorable, smushy face. Smush, smush, smush, smush.\nAmy: You\xe2\x80\x99re hurting me.\nPenny: No, Sheldon hurt you.\nAmy: Before; now it\xe2\x80\x99s you.\nPenny: Oh.\nSheldon: I think I understand. You\xe2\x80\x99re the one person who can say Sheldon Cooper is your boyfriend, but that rings hollow if you can\xe2\x80\x99t lord him over others in the flesh. I forget what I bring to the party and what I take away when I leave. Please accept these valuable Cooper Coupons as restitution.\nPenny: Sheldon, she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want your stupid\xe2\x80\xa6\nAmy: Ooh, Science Center. Redeeming. Let\xe2\x80\x99s go.\nSheldon: Well played, Amy Farrah Fowler. Let me get my coat. (Whip sound) Oh, grow up, Leonard.\nRaj: But e-excuse me, I have something to say. None of you may realize it, but I was very much looking forward to this weekend. It was gonna be like the old days, the four of us hanging out playing video games before you guys all got girlfriends. Do you have any idea what it\xe2\x80\x99s like to be the only one without a girlfriend? Even if I get one someday, I\xe2\x80\x99ll still be the guy who got a girl after Sheldon Cooper!\nPenny: And that\xe2\x80\x99s how a girl makes a scene. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, sweetie. You\xe2\x80\x99re right. You deserve your weekend. Come on, Amy, let\xe2\x80\x99s go.\nAmy: What about the Science Center?\nPenny: I\xe2\x80\x99ll let you hold my hair while I throw up.\nAmy: Rain check.\nBernadette: I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna go, too.\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99ll miss you.\nBernadette: I\xe2\x80\x99ll miss you.\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99ll miss you more.\nBernadette: No, I\xe2\x80\x99ll\xe2\x80\xa6\nRaj: Just leave! Okay, now. This is the way it\xe2\x80\x99s supposed to be. Men together, fighting the forces of evil.\nAll: Hear! Hear!\nRaj: I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe this is only 64 calories.\nScene: Some time later. The guys are asleep.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Howard Joel Wolowitz! I\xe2\x80\x99ve been worried sick for two days, and I know you turned off your phone! You open up this door right now because I\xe2\x80\x99ve had it up to here! I have been to the morgue and the hospital, and I spent the last half hour walking up these ferkakta stairs!\nHoward: That\xe2\x80\x99s my ride, got to go. (Whip sound)\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
