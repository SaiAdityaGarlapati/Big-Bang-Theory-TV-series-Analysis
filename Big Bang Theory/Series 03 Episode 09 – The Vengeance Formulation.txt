b'Scene: Outside an apartment building.\nHoward: So two years later, there\xe2\x80\x99s a knock on the door, guy opens it, and there on his porch is the snail, who says, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat the heck was all that about?\xe2\x80\x9d\nBernadette: I don\xe2\x80\x99t really get it.\nHoward: Well, see, it took two years for the snail to\xe2\x80\xa6 (she kisses him) not important.\nBernadette: Can I ask you a question?\nHoward: Sure.\nBernadette: Where do you think this is going?\nHoward: To be honest, I was hoping at least second base.\nBernadette: You\xe2\x80\x99re so funny. You\xe2\x80\x99re like a stand-up comedian.\nHoward: A Jewish stand-up comedian, that\xe2\x80\x99d be new.\nBernadette: Actually, I think a lot of them are Jewish.\nHoward: No, I was just\xe2\x80\xa6 never mind.\nBernadette: Look, Howard, this is our third date and we both know what that means.\nHoward: We do?\nBernadette: Sex.\nHoward: You\xe2\x80\x99re kidding.\nBernadette: But I need to know whether you\xe2\x80\x99re looking for a relationship or a one-night stand.\nHoward: Okay, just to be clear, there\xe2\x80\x99s only one correct answer, right? It\xe2\x80\x99s not like chicken or fish on an airplane?\nBernadette: Maybe you need to think about it a little.\nHoward: You know, it\xe2\x80\x99s not unheard of for a one-night stand to turn into a relationship.\nBernadette: Call me when you figure it out.\nHoward: Three dates means sex? Who knew?\nScene: The apartment.\nHoward: Greetings, homies, homette.\nPenny: Why are you back from your date so early?\nHoward: In romance, as in show business, always leave them wanting more.\nPenny: What exactly does that mean?\nLeonard: He struck out.\nCredits sequence.\n  Scene: The university cafeteria.\nHoward: Hey, did either of you guys know that three dates with the same woman is the threshold for sex?\nRaj: Actually, I\xe2\x80\x99ve never had three dates with the same woman.\nLeonard: With Penny and me, it took two years. Now that I think about it, that was three dates.\nHoward: Okay, well, before you and Penny hooked up, did she ask for any kind of commitment?\nLeonard: No, she was pretty clear about wanting to keep her options open.\nSheldon (arriving): I have something to announce, but out of respect for convention, I will wait for you to finish your current conversation. What are you talking about?\nLeonard: The cultural paradigm in which people have sex after three dates.\nSheldon: I see. Now, are we talking date, the social interaction, or date, the dried fruit?\nLeonard: Never mind, what\xe2\x80\x99s your announcement?\nSheldon: Oh, good, my turn. Well, this is very exciting and I wanted you to be among the first to know\xe2\x80\xa6\nKripke: Hey, Cooper, I hear you\xe2\x80\x99re going to be on the wadio with Ira Fwatow from Science Fwiday next week.\nSheldon: Thank you, Kripke, for depriving me of the opportunity to share my news with my friends.\nKripke: My pweasure.\nSheldon: My thank you was not sincere.\nKripke: But my pweasure is. Let me ask you a question, at what point did National Public Wadio have to start scwaping the bottom of the bawwel for its guests? Eh, don\xe2\x80\x99t answer, it\xe2\x80\x99s wetowical.\nSheldon: Why are you such a stupid head? That is also rhetorical. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry you had to hear that.\nLeonard: Are you really going to be on NPR?\nSheldon: Yes, they\xe2\x80\x99re interviewing me by phone from my office, regarding the recent so-called discovery of magnetic monopoles in spin-ices. It\xe2\x80\x99s pledge week and they\xe2\x80\x99re trying to goose the ratings with a little controversy.\nLeonard: Very cool, congratulations.\nSheldon: Thank you. My mother is very excited. She\xe2\x80\x99s convening her Bible study group to listen in, and then pray for my soul.\nRaj: I was on the radio once. I called in to Fever 104 FM New Delhi and was the fourth person to say the phrase that pays, \xe2\x80\x9cFever 104, \xe0\xa4\x86\xe0\xa4\x9c \xe0\xa4\x95\xe0\xa5\x87 \xe0\xa4\xa8\xe0\xa4\xaf\xe0\xa5\x87 \xe0\xa4\x85\xe0\xa4\x9a\xe0\xa5\x8d\xe0\xa4\x9b\xe0\xa5\x87 \xe0\xa4\xb8\xe0\xa4\x82\xe0\xa4\x97\xe0\xa5\x80\xe0\xa4\xa4 \xe0\xa4\x95\xe0\xa4\xbe \xe0\xa4\x98\xe0\xa4\xb0.\xe2\x80\x9d That means: \xe2\x80\x9cFever 104, home of the really good current music.\xe2\x80\x9d It\xe2\x80\x99s much catchier in Hindi.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: All right. These are the talking points for my NPR interview tomorrow. I need to make sure that they\xe2\x80\x99re simple enough for the less educated in the audience to understand. Howard, look this over and tell me what\xe2\x80\x99s unclear to you.\nHoward: Excuse me, I have a master\xe2\x80\x99s degree in engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. It required the completion of 144 units of grad work and an original thesis.\nSheldon: Yes. Look this over and tell me what\xe2\x80\x99s unclear to you.\nLeonard: You know, when Sheldon gives you homework, you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to do it.\nRaj: In fact, it\xe2\x80\x99s better if you don\xe2\x80\x99t, otherwise it makes the rest of us look bad.\nPenny: Hi, guys.\nLeonard: Hey.\nSheldon: Hello.\nPenny: Yo, Raj, talk to me. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, just screwing with you. Hey, Howard, why haven\xe2\x80\x99t you called Bernadette?\nHoward: Did she say something?\nPenny: Yeah, she said she hasn\xe2\x80\x99t heard from you in a week. I thought you liked her?\nHoward: I do, yeah, but she wants a commitment and I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure she\xe2\x80\x99s my type.\nPenny: She agreed to go out with you for free. What more do you need?\nHoward: Look, Bernadette is really nice. I just always thought when I finally settle down into a relationship, it would be with someone, you know, different.\nPenny: Different how?\nHoward: Well, you know, more like Megan Fox from Transformers, or Katee Sackhoff from Battlestar Galactica.\nPenny: Are you high?\nLeonard: You\xe2\x80\x99d have a better shot with the three-breasted Martian hooker from Total Recall.\nHoward: Okay, now you\xe2\x80\x99re just being unrealistic. Anyway, that movie was like 20 years ago, imagine how saggy those things would be.\nPenny: Howard, you\xe2\x80\x99re going to throw away a great girl like Bernadette because you\xe2\x80\x99re holding out for some ridiculous fantasy?\nHoward: Hey, just because you settled doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean I have to.\nLeonard: Excuse me, I\xe2\x80\x99m sitting here.\nPenny: Hey, I did not settle for Leonard. I mean, obviously, he isn\xe2\x80\x99t the kind of guy I usually go out with, you know, physically.\nLeonard: Again, I\xe2\x80\x99m right here.\nPenny: My point is, I do not judge a book by its cover. I am interested in the person underneath.\nLeonard: I am here, right? You see me.\nHoward: Hey, I\xe2\x80\x99m interested in what\xe2\x80\x99s inside people, too, but why is it wrong to want those insides wrapped up in, say, the delicious caramel that is Halle Berry? (To Raj) Yes, you\xe2\x80\x99re delicious caramel, too.\nPenny: All right, you know what, I will tell you why it\xe2\x80\x99s wrong\xe2\x80\xa6\nSheldon: Excuse me, may I interject?\nPenny: What?\nSheldon: Biologically speaking, Howard is perfectly justified in seeking out the optimum mate for the propagation of his genetic line.\nHoward: Thank you, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Now, whether that propagation is in the interest of humanity is, of course, an entirely different question.\nScene: Kripke is in a storage cupboard of some kind. He has tubes rigged up through the roof attached to helium tanks which he is turning on. The radio is playing.\nRadio: This is Ira Flatow and you\xe2\x80\x99re listening to NPR\xe2\x80\x99s Science Friday. Joining us today by phone from his office in Pasadena, California is Dr. Sheldon Cooper.\nKripke: Oh, this is going to be a wiot.\nScene switches to Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s office, where the end of the tubing can be seen coming through the wall. Hissing can be heard.\nRadio: Thanks for being with us today, Dr. Cooper.\nSheldon: My pleasure, Ira.\nIra: Now, let\xe2\x80\x99s talk about magnetic monopoles. Can you explain to our audience just what a monopole is?\nSheldon: Of course. First, consider an ordinary magnet which has, (the pitch of his voice begins to rise) as even the most uneducated in your audience must know, two poles, (pitch rises further) a north and south pole. If you cut that in half, you have two smaller magnets, each with its own north and south pole.\nIra: Uh, Dr. Cooper, I think there might be something wrong with our connection.\nSheldon (even higher pitch): No, I hear you fine. As I was saying, an ordinary magnet has two poles. The primary characteristic of a monopole is that it has only one pole, hence, monopole.\nScene cuts to university cafeteria where Kripke is holding up the radio for all to listen.\nSheldon: A requirement for string theory, or M-theory, if you will, is the existence of such monopoles. I, myself, led an expedition to the Arctic Circle in search of said particles. Kripke, I found the nozzle! I\xe2\x80\x99m going to kill you!\nScene: Howard\xe2\x80\x99s bathroom. He is in the bath.\nHoward: So nice you could join me this evening. You\xe2\x80\x99re looking lovely as always.\nKatee Sackhoff: Thanks, Howard. Always nice to be part of your masturbatory fantasies.\nHoward: Come on, Katee, don\xe2\x80\x99t make it sound so cheap.\nKatee: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, fiddling with yourself in the bathtub is a real class act.\nHoward: Thank you. So, shall we get started?\nKatee: Sure. But can I ask you a question first?\nHoward: You want to play Cylon and colonist?\nKatee: No. I want to know why you\xe2\x80\x99re playing make-believe with me when you could be out with a real woman tonight.\nHoward: You mean, Bernadette?\nKatee: No, I mean Princess Leia. Of course I mean Bernadette. She\xe2\x80\x99s a wonderful girl and she really likes you.\nHoward: I know, but she\xe2\x80\x99s not you.\nKatee: I\xe2\x80\x99m not me. The real me is in Beverly Hills going out with a tall, handsome, rich guy.\nHoward: Really? Tall?\nKatee: Six-four.\nHoward: Ouch.\nKatee: The point is, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got a wonderful girl in your life, and you\xe2\x80\x99re ignoring her in order to spend your nights in the bathtub with a mental image and a wash cloth.\nHoward\xe2\x80\x99s Mother: Howard! What are you doing in there?\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m taking a bath!\nHoward\xe2\x80\x99s Mother: I hope that\xe2\x80\x99s all you\xe2\x80\x99re doing! We share that tub!\nHoward: Don\xe2\x80\x99t remind me! (Katee has vanished) Oh, man. All soaped up and no place to go.\nScene: Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom.\nLeonard: How ya doin\xe2\x80\x99, buddy?\nSheldon: I was humiliated on national radio. How do you think I\xe2\x80\x99m doing?\nLeonard: Come on, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t that bad.\nSheldon: What do you want?\nRaj (in a munchkin voice): We represent the Lollipop Guild, and we want you.\nLeonard: Okay, so Kripke played a joke on you.\nSheldon: It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t funny.\nRaj: I thought it was funny.\nLeonard: Raj.\nRaj: You laughed.\nSheldon: Did you laugh?\nLeonard: I fell on the floor. All right, he got you, you can get him back.\nSheldon: I refuse to sink to his level.\nRaj: You can\xe2\x80\x99t sink. With all that helium in you, you\xe2\x80\x99re lucky you don\xe2\x80\x99t float away.\nLeonard: Are you really admitting defeat?\nSheldon: I never admit defeat.\nLeonard: Good.\nSheldon: However, on an unrelated topic, I am never getting out of this bed again.\nLeonard: What if you could make Kripke look even sillier than he made you look?\nRaj: I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x99s possible, dude.\nLeonard: You\xe2\x80\x99re not helping.\nRaj: I didn\xe2\x80\x99t come to help, I came to mock.\nLeonard: Sheldon, what you need to do is figure out a way to exact vengeance on Kripke, like, uh, like, how the Joker got back at Batman for putting him in the Arkham Asylum for the Criminally Insane.\nRaj: That\xe2\x80\x99s true. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t just stay there and talk about his feelings with the other psychotic villains. He, he broke out and poisoned Gotham\xe2\x80\x99s water supply.\nSheldon: Well, I suppose I could poison Kripke.\nLeonard: No, no.\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s a simple matter. There are several toxic chemicals that\xe2\x80\x99d be untraceable in an autopsy.\nLeonard: Okay, uh, that\xe2\x80\x99s the spirit, but, um, let\xe2\x80\x99s dial it back to a non-lethal form of vengeance.\nSheldon: Oh! How about we put awhoopee cushion on his office chair? He\xe2\x80\x99ll sit down, it\xe2\x80\x99ll sound like he\xe2\x80\x99s flatulent, even though he\xe2\x80\x99s not.\nLeonard: Let\xe2\x80\x99s keep thinking.\nScene: The Cheesecake Factory. Howard enters.\nPenny: Oh, gee, you\xe2\x80\x99re too late. Scarlett Johansson and Wonder Woman were just in here trolling around for neurotic, little weasels.\nHoward: Yeah, I came to talk to Bernadette. She\xe2\x80\x99s working today, right?\nPenny: Yes, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think she wants to see you.\nHoward: Why not?\nPenny: Come on, Howard. You hurt her feelings by not calling her all week. Plus, I\xe2\x80\x99ve kind of been talkin\xe2\x80\x99 some smack about ya.\nBernadette: Hello, Howard.\nHoward: Wait, Bernadette, I need to talk to you.\nBernadette: I can\xe2\x80\x99t now, I\xe2\x80\x99m working.\nHoward: This will only take a second. You asked me to think about where our relationship was going, and I did. Bernadette? Will you marry me?\nBernadette: Is this more comedy that I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand?\nHoward: No. I\xe2\x80\x99m serious. I\xe2\x80\x99m never going to find another girl like you who likes me and is, you know, real.\nBernadette: So, this isn\xe2\x80\x99t a joke?\nHoward: No.\nBernadette: Then you\xe2\x80\x99re insane.\nHoward: I prefer to think of myself as quirky.\nBernadette: Howard, we\xe2\x80\x99ve only been on three dates. We haven\xe2\x80\x99t even had sex yet.\nHoward: Fair enough. When\xe2\x80\x99s your break?\nBernadette: Wow. (Walks away)\nHoward: Don\xe2\x80\x99t you just hate when this happens?\nPenny: Wow.\nScene: The apartment kitchen.\nSheldon: All right, how\xe2\x80\x99s this for revenge? A solution of hydrogen peroxide, and one of saturated potassium iodide.\nRaj: What\xe2\x80\x99s this?\nSheldon: Mountain Dew. Ah, refreshing. Now, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to combine these chemicals with ordinary dish soap, creating a little exothermic release of oxygen.\nRaj: Foamy vengeance.\nSheldon: Yes, exactly.\nLeonard: This is brilliant, Sheldon. How are we going to deploy it in Kripke\xe2\x80\x99s office?\nSheldon: Already taken care of. Observe. This is a live shot of Kripke\xe2\x80\x99s lab via a mini webcam I was able to install, thanks to a dollar bill discreetly placed in the night janitor\xe2\x80\x99s shirt pocket. At the same time, I also secured large quantities of these chemicals above the tiles in the drop ceiling.\nRaj: Oh, Sheldon, you remind me of a young Lex Luthor.\nSheldon: You flatter me, sir.\nLeonard: Let me guess, motion sensors?\nSheldon: The reaction will be triggered when Kripke reaches the center of the room. Mwah, ha, ha.\nLeonard: I gotta say, I am really impressed. This is truly the Sheldon Cooper way to get even. (Sits down. There is a flatulent noise)\nSheldon: It may be low-tech, but I still maintain the whoopee cushion has comic validity.\nRaj: Here comes Kripke!\nLeonard: Who is that with him?\nRaj: I believe that\xe2\x80\x99s the president of the university.\nLeonard: And the board of directors. Abort! Abort!\nSheldon: There is no abort.\nRaj: Well, how could you not put in an abort?\nSheldon: I made a boo-boo, all right?\nKripke: I think the board will weally appweciate how well we\xe2\x80\x99re using that NSA gwant, Pwesident Seibert. Wight here we have a micwo-contwolled pwasma\xe2\x80\xa6 (foam falls from the ceiling soaking everyone)\nRaj: Wow. Looks like the Ganges on laundry day.\nLeonard: At least they don\xe2\x80\x99t know it was you.\nSheldon (on Kripke\xe2\x80\x99s computer in the lab): Hello, Kripke. This classic prank comes to you from the malevolent mind of Sheldon Cooper. If you\xe2\x80\x99d like to see the look on your stupid face, this video is being instantly uploaded to YouTube. Oh, and a hat tip to Leonard Hofstadter and Raj Koothrappali for their support and encouragement in this enterprise.\nRaj: Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m going back to India. What\xe2\x80\x99s your plan?\nScene: The Cheesecake Factory.\n  Penny: Hey, here\xe2\x80\x99s your tip from table seven.\nBernadette: Oh, thanks.\nPenny: Mm-hmm.\nHoward (on the stage, into a microphone): Testing. Check. Check two.\nBernadette: Oh, now what?\nPenny: You want me to throw him out?\nBernadette: No, that\xe2\x80\x99s okay.\nPenny: Are you sure? He\xe2\x80\x99s small. I bet I can get a nice, tight spiral on him.\nHoward: I want to dedicate this number to a great gal who I\xe2\x80\x99ve done wrong. (To the tune of the Four Tops song Bernadette) Bernadette, I am so sorry for trying to propose to you, Bernadette, you found it creepy but that\xe2\x80\x99s just the kind of thing I do. I know now it was too soon to talk of love. It was just a crazy idea that came to me in my tub. But, Bernadette, give me one more chance, sweet Bernadette, I\xe2\x80\x99ll get the hang of this thing they call romance, sweet Bernadette, I dream to once again kiss your lips, sweet Bernadette. Sincerely yours, Howard Wolowitz, Bernadette\xe2\x80\xa6\nPenny: Oh, I am so sorry.\nBernadette: Are you kidding? That\xe2\x80\x99s the most romantic thing anyone\xe2\x80\x99s ever done for me.\nHoward (still singing): \xe2\x80\xa6Bernadette! Thank you, Cheesecake Factory!\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
