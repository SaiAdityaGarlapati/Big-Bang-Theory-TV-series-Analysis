b'Scene: The apartment.\nSheldon: I recently read that during World War Two, Joseph Stalin had a research program to create supersoldiers by having women impregnated by gorillas.\nHoward: What a sick use of science.\nRaj: Hey, as long as the baby\xe2\x80\x99s healthy.\nAmy: I wonder if Stalin considered any other animals.\nLeonard: Hippos are the deadliest creature. A half-human, half-hippo soldier would be pretty badass.\nHoward: Yes, but when they\xe2\x80\x99re hungry-hungry, you can stop them with marbles.\nSheldon: Yeah, the correct animal for interspecies supersolider is koala. You would wind up with an army so cute it couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be attacked.\nRaj: But half-man, half-owl could fly\xe2\x80\xa6\nSheldon: The answer is cuddly soldiers with big flat noses. Moving on.\nHoward: So, Penny, when\xe2\x80\x99s the new job start?\nPenny: Next Monday.\nBernadette: Did you get a chance to look over the materials I gave you?\nPenny: Uh, not yet, but I will.\nBernadette: Great. When?\nPenny: I said I\xe2\x80\x99ll get to it.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m sensing awkwardness, am I right?\nAmy: Yes.\nSheldon: Swish.\nBernadette: I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be pushy, but you\xe2\x80\x99ve never done pharmaceutical sales before. It seems like you could use this time to get a head start.\nPenny: Well, the first few weeks will be all training. They\xe2\x80\x99ll tell me everything I need to know.\nBernadette: But imagine how impressed they\xe2\x80\x99d be if you showed up already familiar with the material.\nPenny: Okay, so what, you want me to be like a teacher\xe2\x80\x99s pet?\nBernadette: Couldn\xe2\x80\x99t hurt.\nLeonard: Mm, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Who here has ever been hurt because they were the teacher\xe2\x80\x99s pet?\nSheldon: It was like the rest of the class wanted Ms. McDonald to forget the quiz.\nScene: Mrs Davis\xe2\x80\x99 office.\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Mrs. Davis. (Knock, knock, knock) Guess who?\nMrs Davis: Dr. Cooper.\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) That\xe2\x80\x99s right, good job. Hello. Uh, you wanted to see me?\nMrs Davis: Yes. Uh, welcome back.\nSheldon: Thank you. I assume you\xe2\x80\x99d like to reopen our dialogue about the university forcing me to continue with string theory?\nMrs Davis: You mean the dialogue that went, please, no, please, no, please, no.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s the one. I believe you went last, so, uh, please?\nMrs Davis: Dr. Cooper, while you were away, we came up with a solution that would allow you to change your field of study.\nSheldon: Wow. Pouting and running away actually worked. I must say, that may not be a lesson you want to reinforce with me. So, um, what is the solution?\nMrs Davis: Currently, you\xe2\x80\x99re being paid under a grant to specifically research string theory. If we promote you to junior professor, you\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to choose whatever field of research you\xe2\x80\x99d like.\nSheldon: But if I\xe2\x80\x99m a professor, then I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to teach a class.\nMrs Davis: That is correct.\nSheldon: So your solution is to promote me and pay me more money so that I can impart my knowledge to the next generation of scientists?\nMrs Davis: Yes.\nSheldon: You people are sick.\nScene: Amy\xe2\x80\x99s lab.\nPenny: Hey. Ready to go to lunch?\nAmy: Just give me a minute. I\xe2\x80\x99m stimulating the pleasure cells of this starfish. I just need to turn it off.\nPenny: What happens if you don\xe2\x80\x99t?\nAmy: Then I have to sit through lunch knowing this starfish is having a better day than I am. Is Bernadette meeting us at the restaurant?\nPenny: Uh, no. Actually, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t invite her.\nAmy: How come?\nPenny: Well, ever since she helped me get this job, she won\xe2\x80\x99t stop bugging me.\nAmy: Well, I think she just wants you to do well, and she\xe2\x80\x99s worried that you won\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x99cause you were just a stunningly poor waitress.\nPenny: That is not true.\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99m still waiting on my mini corndogs from two years ago.\nPenny: I told you, they\xe2\x80\x99ll be right out.\nAmy: Okay, so no Bernadette.\nPenny: Well, you saw her the other night. Am I wrong?\nAmy: No, I just, I feel kind of uncomfortable talking about her like this. Usually when someone\xe2\x80\x99s being talked about behind their back, it\xe2\x80\x99s me and it\xe2\x80\x99s right in front of my face.\nPenny: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. I just need a little break from her.\nAmy: I understand. You know, there is some research that indicates that sharing negative attitudes about a third party can be a powerful bonding force between two friends.\nPenny: So, what are you saying?\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99m saying, in the spirit of science, what is that little skank\xe2\x80\x99s problem?\nScene: The cafeteria.\nRaj: So, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been trying to come up with a cute couple\xe2\x80\x99s nickname for me and Emily. What do you like better? Emippali or Koothrapemily?\nHoward: Why is it your last name and her first name?\nRaj: Oh, well, her last name is Sweeney, and something just didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem right about Koothrapeeney.\nLeonard: Hey, how\xe2\x80\x99d it go with human resources?\nSheldon: Awful. They\xe2\x80\x99re allowing me to move on from string theory, but they made me a junior professor and are requiring me to teach a class.\nRaj: I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand. Why is it bad that you have to teach?\nSheldon: What a stupid question.\nLeonard: The kids are gonna love him.\nSheldon: I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe I have to waste my time babysitting a bunch of grad students who probably think dark matter is what\xe2\x80\x99s in their diapers.\nLeonard: This might not be that bad. Uh, you like telling people they\xe2\x80\x99re wrong.\nSheldon: Wrong, Just because I enjoyed that one doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean I always do.\nRaj: You enjoy giving people grades.\nSheldon: A valid point, but unoriginal. B-minus.\nHoward: And you love the sound of your own voice.\nSheldon: Yeah, well, of course I do. Listen to it. It\xe2\x80\x99s like an earful of melted caramel.\nLeonard: Look, most importantly, this will let you move on and study dark matter.\nSheldon: It is true that many of my heroes have taken students under their wings. Feynman, Einstein, Professor X. Humorously, in the case of Professor X, some of his students actually had wings. That\xe2\x80\x99s rich. I\xe2\x80\x99ll use that one to lighten the mood after my entire class fails the midterm.\nScene: Amy\xe2\x80\x99s lab.\nAmy: Measuring starfish serotonin levels in response to one point two molar stimulation of pleasure cells. You like that, don\xe2\x80\x99t you? That\xe2\x80\x99s right, say my name.\nBernadette (on skype): Hey.\nAmy: Hey, what\xe2\x80\x99s going on?\nBernadette: Not much. You want to get a drink later? Just the two of us?\nAmy: No Penny?\nBernadette: Not tonight. I\xe2\x80\x99m a little frustrated with her.\nAmy: Because you got her the job and you think she should be working harder to prepare for it?\nBernadette: So it\xe2\x80\x99s not just me. You see it, too.\nAmy: I do, I see it.\nBernadette: It\xe2\x80\x99s driving me crazy. Just this afternoon, I saw on Instagram that instead of studying, she went out to lunch and got a manicure.\nAmy: That\xe2\x80\x99s outrageous.\nBernadette: I know.\nAmy: If she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t do well, this could reflect poorly on you.\nBernadette: Exactly. Does she not realize it or does she not care?\nAmy: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. The important thing is I am here for you so we can mutually disparage this unpleasing third party.\nScene: Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s classroom.\nLeonard: Hey. We just wanted to see how your class was going. Where is everybody?\nSheldon: There is no class.\nHoward: Did you send everyone to the principal\xe2\x80\x99s office already?\nSheldon: No one signed up.\nLeonard: Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s not your fault.\nSheldon: I called the department secretary to see what happened. Apparently, I have a reputation for being obnoxious.\nLeonard: What?\nRaj: Hey, Sheldon, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.\nSheldon: No, it\xe2\x80\x99s fine. Now I can devote all my time to dark matter.\nRaj: Aw, you brought cookies for everyone?\nSheldon: Oh, yes. Fig Newtons. I was going to ask them which scientist both helped to develop calculus and had a famous cookie named after him? And then after someone said Newton, I was going to tell them they\xe2\x80\x99re wrong. The cookies are named after a town in Massachusetts. And then I\xe2\x80\x99d throw the cookies away.\nHoward: Hey, what if I took your class?\nSheldon: Why would you do that?\nLeonard: Yeah, why would you do that?\nRaj: What\xe2\x80\x99s wrong with you?\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking about getting my doctorate, and he wants to teach. Why not?\nSheldon: Oh, Howard. I appreciate the gesture, but this is a graduate-level physics class. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you\xe2\x80\x99d understand a single thing I was talking about.\nRaj: Ask why not again, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got an answer.\nHoward: Sheldon, I\xe2\x80\x99m more than smart enough to take your class.\nSheldon: No.\nHoward: Yes.\nSheldon: How would you determine the ground state of a quantum system with no exact solution?\nHoward: I would guess a wave-function and then vary its parameters until I found the lowest energy solution.\nSheldon: Hmm. Do you know how to integrate X squared times E to the minus X, without looking it up?\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99d use Feynman\xe2\x80\x99s trick, differentiate under the integral sign.\nSheldon: Okay. Um, what is the correct interpretation of quantum mechanics?\nHoward: Since every interpretation gives exactly the same answer to every measurement, they are all equally correct. However, I know you believe in the Many Worlds Interpretation, so I\xe2\x80\x99ll say that. Now do you think I\xe2\x80\x99m smart enough?\nSheldon: No.\nHoward: Oh, come on. You might\xe2\x80\x99ve gone to school for a couple more years than me, but guess what, engineers are just as smart as physicists.\nSheldon: You take that back.\nHoward: No.\nScene: The stairwell.\nAmy: So, after drinks with Bernadette, I get home, and Penny calls to complain about her. And then while I\xe2\x80\x99m talking to Penny, I get a text from Bernadette.\nSheldon: I am trying to prepare my lesson plan for Howard. Why are you telling me this?\nAmy: Because it\xe2\x80\x99s taken 15 years, but high school is finally awesome. I love them both, but I\xe2\x80\x99m in the centre now, and I love that even more.\nSheldon: Amy, please. I am trying to figure out a way to intellectually emasculate a dear friend of mine.\nAmy: But I\xe2\x80\x99m just\xe2\x80\xa6\nSheldon: Not now.\nAmy: You better watch that attitude, buddy. You\xe2\x80\x99re dating the popular girl now.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: Hmm. You\xe2\x80\x99re up late.\nSheldon: Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m working on my lesson plan for Wolowitz. He is going to be so lost. Look at this section over here. Even I don\xe2\x80\x99t really understand it.\nLeonard: Sheldon, why are you doing this?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m a teacher, Leonard. It\xe2\x80\x99s my job.\nLeonard: No, I mean, why are you going to so much trouble to prove that you\xe2\x80\x99re smarter than Wolowitz?\nSheldon: Oh, it\xe2\x80\x99s no trouble, it\xe2\x80\x99s actually a pleasure.\nLeonard: You want to know what I think? I think the idea that someone could be as smart as you, or even smarter, scares the pants off you, and you can\xe2\x80\x99t deal with it.\nSheldon: Interesting point. You\xe2\x80\x99re suggesting that I have emotional issues below my consciousness which drive my behaviour, thus causing me to lash out at anything or anyone that threatens my intellectual superiority.\nLeonard: Might be something to think about.\nSheldon: Leonard?\nLeonard: Yeah.\nSheldon: Howard\xe2\x80\x99s allergic to peanuts. How can I use that against him?\nScene: Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s classroom.\nHoward: Hey.\nSheldon: Okay, now that everyone\xe2\x80\x99s here, we can begin.\nHoward: Before we do, I just talked to Leonard. And if you\xe2\x80\x99re gonna spend all your time trying to belittle me by making this class unnecessarily hard, then I\xe2\x80\x99m out. But if you\xe2\x80\x99re interested in making a sincere effort to be a good teacher, then I\xe2\x80\x99m willing to give this a shot.\nSheldon: I suppose that\xe2\x80\x99s a fair request. There\xe2\x80\x99s no reason we both can\xe2\x80\x99t benefit from this experience.\nHoward: Okay.\nSheldon: Okay. Well, then, uh, first things first. Um, are you familiar with the Brachistochrone problem?\nHoward: I am.\nSheldon: Good. And how it relates to the calculus of variations?\nHoward: It\xe2\x80\x99s an inverted cycloid.\nSheldon: Wonderful. Now, what about Euler-Lagrange theorems?\nHoward: That\xe2\x80\x99s where I\xe2\x80\x99m a little fuzzy.\nSheldon: Ha! I knew it. All right. We have a lot of information to cover before your first test. Which, by the way, is in eight minutes. The good news is I\xe2\x80\x99m grading on a curve, so you\xe2\x80\x99re pretty much guaranteed a C.\nHoward (singing): All I do is win, win, win no matter what.\nSheldon: What are you doing?\nHoward (singing): Everybody hands go up, up and they stay there!\nSheldon: What are you doing?\nHoward: If you\xe2\x80\x99re gonna be a crappy teacher, then I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna be a crappy student. (Singing) Uh, uh, Ludacris going in on the verse. \xe2\x80\x99cause I never been defeated and I won\xe2\x80\x99t stop now\xe2\x80\xa6\nSheldon: Will you stop it. This is a classroom. This is not American Bandstand.\nHoward: Okay.\nSheldon: Now, where was I? Let\xe2\x80\x99s see. Oh, yes. Over here. You\xe2\x80\xa6 What are you doing now?\nHoward: Making a straw.\nSheldon: Why?\nHoward: So I can shoot you with a spitball.\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re not going to do that, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you why. This is an institution of higher learning, I am your professor, and you\xe2\x80\x99re going to treat me with the prop\xe2\x80\xa6 You shot your spit in my mouth!\nHoward: Is that gonna be on the test? Because I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I can do that again.\nScene: Amy\xe2\x80\x99s lab.\nAmy (on phone): Hey, girlfriend. Can I get a what what?\nPenny: What?\nAmy: Close enough. Um, I was just calling to see what you were up tonight. Thought maybe we could hit up Color Me Mine, maybe sneak in some Pinot Greej. Whatevs.\nPenny: Uh, thanks, but I think I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna stay in and go over the stuff Bernadette gave me.\nAmy: Oh. Oh, I hear you. Try and get that nag off your back, right? I mean, you\xe2\x80\x99re not a bicycle, why\xe2\x80\x99s she riding you like that?\nPenny: No, I think she was just trying to help. Plus, I really want to do well at this job. So\xe2\x80\xa6\nAmy: Okay, good luck. And call me later, you know, if you decide she\xe2\x80\x99s a bitch or something. Hey, girlfriend.\nBernadette: Hey, Amy.\nAmy: Tonight. You, me, Color Me Mine. Maybe we sneak in some Pinot, make it Color Me Wine.\nBernadette: That sounds fun, but I promised Penny I\xe2\x80\x99d come by and help her study.\nAmy: Oh. Well, good luck getting her to do that. She\xe2\x80\x99s probably off getting another manicure. You remember when she did that? You remember?\nBernadette: I was probably being too hard on her. We talked, we\xe2\x80\x99re good.\nAmy: Oh. Great. I\xe2\x80\x99m happy for you guys. You know, when the two of you aren\xe2\x80\x99t getting along, it puts me in a really weird position.\nBernadette: Well, don\xe2\x80\x99t worry, everything\xe2\x80\x99s back to normal.\nAmy: You mean, like, where she\xe2\x80\x99s nice to your face? Okay got it. Bye. Hey, boyfriend.\nSheldon: Can\xe2\x80\x99t talk. Spitball. Probably gonna die.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Well?\nLeonard: Sheldon, I promise. Your uvula does not have an STD.\nSheldon: Are you sure? It just doesn\xe2\x80\x99t feel as innocent as it used to.\nHoward: You reported me to human resources?\nSheldon: You violated the sanctity of my mouth.\nHoward: Well, I dropped your class, so I hope you\xe2\x80\x99re happy.\nSheldon: I told you you weren\xe2\x80\x99t smart enough to take it.\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m smart enough, Sheldon. Asking me a bunch of questions about a topic I\xe2\x80\x99m not familiar with doesn\xe2\x80\x99t prove anything. I could do the same to you.\nSheldon: Yeah, try me.\nHoward: Okay. You enjoy making fun of engineering so much, how do you quantify the strength of materials?\nSheldon: Young\xe2\x80\x99s modulus.\nRaj: Is that right?\nHoward: Yeah. Okay, how do you prevent eddy currents in a transformer?\nSheldon: Laminate the core material.\nLeonard: Come on, give him a hard one.\nHoward: That was a hard one. All right. How does the flow rate in a pipe depend on its diameter? You don\xe2\x80\x99t know, do you? What\xe2\x80\x99s the matter, smart guy? Don\xe2\x80\x99t know Poiseuille\xe2\x80\x99s law?\nSheldon (coughing several times): Thank goodness I got it. Now I can quit checking my stool.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nBernadette: Okay, what are the potential side effects for our erectile dysfunction drug?\nPenny: Headaches, dizziness and nausea.\nBernadette: Yes.\nPenny: Those are also the side effects of having a 75-year-old man with an erection climb on top of you.\nBernadette: Want to stop here?\nPenny: Uh, no. I can keep going.\nBernadette: Nah, you got this. Let\xe2\x80\x99s go for a drink. I\xe2\x80\x99ll call Amy.\nPenny: Okay, good. She seemed like she really wanted to go out tonight.\nAmy (phone ringing, running down stairs from outside Penny\xe2\x80\x99s door): Hey, girl.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: Okay, next question, for the Butterfinger. How long is a galactic yea\nRaj: 250 million years.\nLeonard: Yes. (Cheers)\nHoward: Okay, this one is for a Cadbury Creme Egg.\nSheldon: Oh! It\xe2\x80\x99s not even Easter time. This is crazy.\nHoward: Which Archimedean solid has 20 regular triangular faces, 30 square faces, 12 pentagonal faces, 60 vertices and 120 edges?\nAll together: The Rhombicosidodecahedron. (Cheers)\nLeonard: We are so smart.\nRaj: Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t girls like us in high school?\nHoward: Because we were awkward and weird and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t play sports!\nLeonard: Right again. (Cheers)\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
