b'Scene: The apartment.\nAmy: Should you really be sitting in Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s spot?\nRaj: He\xe2\x80\x99s in Texas, he\xe2\x80\x99ll never know.\nPenny: I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be so sure about that.\nLeonard: Yeah, he has a very sensitive butt. Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s true. Once I saw him sit on a bunch of loose change and add it up.\nRaj: Have you heard from Howard?\nBernadette: I did. His talk at NASA went great.\nPenny: Sheldon didn\xe2\x80\x99t heckle him?\nBernadette: No, in fact, he was so well-behaved, Howie bought him a Buzz Aldrin bobble head and astronaut ice cream.\nStuart: Hey, guys.\nAmy: Oh, hi.\nBernadette: Hi, Stuart.\nRaj: Hey, Stuart!\nStuart: How\xe2\x80\x99s it going?\nRaj: Good. Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s out of town, so we can do whatever we want. We even ordered from the Thai place he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like.\nStuart: Oh, how is it?\nPenny: Disgusting. Do not tell him.\nLeonard: What do you guys want to do tonight?\nAmy: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\nBernadette: Well, I told Howie if I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t busy, I\xe2\x80\x99d spend the night at his mom\xe2\x80\x99s. So for God\xe2\x80\x99s sake, think of something.\nRaj: Stuart? Are you okay?\nStuart: No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t feel so\xe2\x80\xa6\nLeonard: Oh, my God, Stuart?\nPenny: Oh, my God, you guys need to do something!\nRaj: Stuart?\nLeonard: Calling 911.\nRaj: Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s too late.\nLeonard: What do you mean it\xe2\x80\x99s too late?\nRaj: He\xe2\x80\x99s been murdered by someone in this room.\nPenny: Oh, my God.\nLeonard: Oh, come on.\nRaj: Welcome to another classic Koothrappali murder mystery dinner.\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99m leaving.\nRaj: You can\xe2\x80\x99t leave. You\xe2\x80\x99re a suspect in the mysterious murder of Stuart Bloom.\nBernadette: I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know his last name was Bloom.\nAmy: Yeah, it\xe2\x80\x99s Bloom.\nPenny: Are you really gonna lie on the floor and pretend to be dead all night?\nStuart: What do you think I was gonna do at home?\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The apartment.\nPenny: Are you gonna make us pretend to be a bunch of lame characters with silly accents?\nRaj: Lame characters with silly ac\xe2\x80\xa6, what kind of actress are you?\nPenny: You\xe2\x80\x99re right, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. Sounds like fun.\nRaj: Thank you.\nPenny: That kind of actress. This sucks.\nLeonard: Come on, guys. Raj put a lot of effort into this. And that\xe2\x80\x99s great. It\xe2\x80\x99s not sad, it\xe2\x80\x99s great.\nAmy: I think it might be fun to be someone else tonight.\nRaj: Actually, you\xe2\x80\x99re all just gonna be yourselves.\nAmy: Oh, ugh.\nBernadette: All right, if I\xe2\x80\x99m doing this, I\xe2\x80\x99m playing to win, so just to be clear, if we\xe2\x80\x99re ourselves, that means one of us killed Stuart?\nRaj: Very good, Bernadette. You are a regular Byomkesh Bakshi.\nBernadette: What is that, like, the Indian Sherlock Holmes?\nRaj: Or is Sherlock Holmes the English Byomkesh Bakshi?\nAmy: According to Wikipedia, Sherlock Holmes came first.\nRaj: Great, everyone\xe2\x80\x99s a Byomkesh Bakshi. Now, here are some secret facts about each of you, including whether you are the murderer. Throughout the game, feel free to ask each other questions to uncover clues.\nPenny: Got it. Hey, who\xe2\x80\x99s the murderer?\nRaj: Any question but that.\nPenny: Sorry. Hey, who\xe2\x80\x99s not the murderer?\nStuart: Bernadette, can you not stand so close to me?\nBernadette: What do you care? You\xe2\x80\x99re dead.\nStuart: Suit yourself. But I can kind of see up your skirt.\nScene: A hire car.\nSheldon: Thank you for my bobble head.\nHoward: Thank you for not making fun of me during my speech.\nSheldon: It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t easy. Was it Buzz?\nHoward: We can\xe2\x80\x99t show up to your mom\xe2\x80\x99s empty-handed. We should bring something.\nSheldon: I already am. I\xe2\x80\x99m bringing the gift of knowledge.\nHoward: Oh, boy.\nSheldon: Despite what her Bible says, recent archaeological studies indicate that although camels are referenced in the Old Testament, they didn\xe2\x80\x99t exist in the Middle East until hundreds of years later.\nHoward: I was gonna say we pick up a cake or a pie. But an insult to her faith is always thoughtful.\nScene: The apartment.\nBernadette: So, what happens next?\nRaj: I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell you that. But perhaps the killer dropped a fun and imaginative clue somewhere in the apartment.\nPenny: Ooh, I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna check the fridge, and see if there are any clues inside a beer.\nAmy: Hey, I found something. It looks like a little man with a briefcase.\nLeonard: Oh, no, no. That\xe2\x80\x99s Clarence Darrow. It\xe2\x80\x99s from a game Sheldon made up called Chutes and Lawyers. You slide down a chute and then work your way back up through the appellate system.\nRaj: Well, unlike that, my games are much more fun.\nPenny: Okay, can I ask you something? Why do you like making us do this stuff?\nRaj: Well, I guess it goes back to when I was a fat kid in India, and didn\xe2\x80\x99t have any friends.\nBernadette: I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know you were fat.\nRaj: Yeah, I was. I was 200 pounds by the time I was in middle school. Kids were mean. Cows may be sacred there, but it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t help if you look like one. Anyway, I was pretty lonely, so I had to make up my own stories and games, and I promised myself if I ever made any friends that, that I would play those games with them.\nAmy: That is so sweet.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen old pictures of you. You were never a fat kid.\nRaj: No, I was svelte as a gazelle. A gazelle blessed with a flair for storytelling.\nBernadette: Hey, what about this? It looks like a receipt.\nAmy: What\xe2\x80\x99s it for?\nBernadette: For a cup of coffee. But it\xe2\x80\x99s dated 20 years from now.\nRaj: From the future? How fun and imaginative.\nLeonard: So one of us came back from the future to murder Stuart?\nRaj: Correct.\nLeonard: Does the gazelle with a flair for storytelling know he\xe2\x80\x99s just ripping off Terminator?\nRaj: Does the smart-ass know that Terminator was actually ripped off from an Outer Limits script called Demon With a Glass Hand, by Harlan Ellison?\nLeonard: Oh, does the gazelle know that according to Harlan Ellison, it was not ripped off from Demon With a Glass Hand, but was ripped off from another Outer Limits script he wrote called The Soldier?\nPenny: I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna need another clue.\nScene: Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s childhood home.\nHoward: Okay, give me the flowers and pie.\nSheldon: But if we show up and you\xe2\x80\x99re holding them, she\xe2\x80\x99ll think they\xe2\x80\x99re only from you.\nHoward: They are only from me. You said the gift of you was enough.\nSheldon: Yes, but now that I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen what the gift of me with flowers and pie looks like, there\xe2\x80\x99s no going back. Boy, I can\xe2\x80\x99t wait to see the look on her face. We\xe2\x80\x99re leaving right now.\nHoward: What\xe2\x80\x99s wrong?\nSheldon: Nothing.\nHoward: What? Sheldon, tell me what\xe2\x80\x99s going on.\nSheldon: I saw my mommy with a naked man and she was trying to be a mommy again.\nScene: A bar in Texas.\nHoward: You ready to talk about it?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m not nearly drunk enough. Okay. Do you have any idea what it\xe2\x80\x99s like to see your mother ravaging someone?\nHoward: Does a brisket count? I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, buddy, that\xe2\x80\x99s rough. But didn\xe2\x80\x99t she know we were coming?\nSheldon: No. I wanted to surprise her. What am I supposed to say to her after something like this?\nHoward: Well, did she see you in the window?\nSheldon: No.\nHoward: Then don\xe2\x80\x99t say anything.\nSheldon: I have to. How can we ever hope to have a healthy relationship if I don\xe2\x80\x99t tell her how disappointed I am, and that I\xe2\x80\x99ll never forgive her?\nHoward: Well, don\xe2\x80\x99t do it on the phone.\nSheldon: No, I\xe2\x80\x99m just going to tell her I\xe2\x80\x99m coming so she can give that good time Charlie the heave-ho.\nHoward: That\xe2\x80\x99s some tough talk, I may need to cut you off.\nSheldon: Yeah, maybe you better, I took a pretty big sip.\nHoward: Look, she\xe2\x80\x99s a grown woman. And, and your dad\xe2\x80\x99s been gone a long time. Maybe this is none of your business.\nSheldon: I beg to differ. I used to live in those genitals. And if someone wants to move into my old room, I should at least get a vote.\nScene: The apartment.\nRaj: Okay, murder suspects, Leonard has found the time machine the killer must\xe2\x80\x99ve used. You\xe2\x80\x99re all inside it, and we hurtle through the very fabric of time. And welcome to 20 years in the future. Hey, you guys just time-travelled. Stop looking so bored.\nPenny: Well, my beer isn\xe2\x80\x99t flat and my rack\xe2\x80\x99s not saggy. So far, the future\xe2\x80\x99s great.\nStuart: Hey, can I go to the bathroom?\nRaj: Fine, just try not to look too alive.\nStuart: That\xe2\x80\x99s my jam.\nBernadette: So one of us went back in time to kill Stuart?\nAmy: But why?\nRaj: Perhaps this will help. Here are some facts about yourselves in the future that might contain a clue.\nAmy: Hey, I won the Nobel Prize in physiology, then I used the money to buy Stuart\xe2\x80\x99s comic book store, and close it down so Sheldon would pay attention to me. Not the worst idea.\nPenny: Hey, I\xe2\x80\x99m a famous actress living in London.\nLeonard: Hmm, I\xe2\x80\x99m a professor at Stanford.\nPenny: Hmm.\nBernadette: So I guess you two are making it work long distance.\nRaj: Oh, no. In this game, as your careers both took off, you drifted apart. Kind of like how future me lost touch with you guys after I became boy toy for the wrinkled, but still flexible, Madonna.\nAmy: What does your card say, Bernadette?\nLeonard: Uh, uh, uh, hang on. Do you think we\xe2\x80\x99d really drift apart if we both became successful?\nPenny: Of course not. If I became a famous actress and had to move, you would just come with me.\nLeonard: But if I get a chance to be a tenured professor, I might not have that much choice in where I end up.\nPenny: Yeah, but if I become a successful actress, we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t need the money.\nLeonard: Well, you don\xe2\x80\x99t go into science for the money.\nBernadette: Speak for yourself. Last month, my company both invented and cured Restless Eye Syndrome. Ka-ching, ya blinky chumps.\nPenny: So, wait, if my career took me somewhere else, you might not go?\nAmy: Dun, dun, dun. He started it.\nRaj: Okay, okay, guys, new back stories. Uh, Penny and Leonard, you two lovebirds are super successful and living in New York. Uh, you\xe2\x80\x99re an actress, you\xe2\x80\x99re a professor and you have three beautiful kids.\nLeonard: Great.\nPenny: Really? You think I\xe2\x80\x99m putting this body through three kids?\nScene: Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s childhood home.\nSheldon: Okay, let\xe2\x80\x99s do this.\nHoward: Good luck.\nSheldon: You, aren\xe2\x80\x99t you gonna come with me?\nHoward: While you confront your mother about her sex life? I\xe2\x80\x99d rather go back to that bar in ass-less chaps.\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Mother? (Knock, knock, knock) Mother? (Knock, knock, knock) Mother?\nMrs Cooper: Shelly, I\xe2\x80\x99m so glad you\xe2\x80\x99re here.\nSheldon: I saw you having naked sex.\nMrs Cooper: What are you talking about?\nSheldon: Earlier, I came here to surprise you. I looked in the window and I saw you with a man.\nMrs Cooper: Oh, Shelly, I\xe2\x80\x99m so sorry. Come in. Um, maybe we should sit down and talk about this.\nSheldon: Can you recommend a surface you haven\xe2\x80\x99t had coitus on?\nMrs Cooper: That\xe2\x80\x99s not funny. Maybe we should sit at the table. Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that, uh, you have a lot of questions.\nSheldon: Who was he?\nMrs Cooper: His name is Ron. I met him at my prayer group.\nSheldon: How long have you been involved with him?\nMrs Cooper: A few months.\nSheldon: And of those few months, how long have you been a demented sex pervert?\nMrs Cooper: That is no way to speak to your mother.\nSheldon: Perhaps not. But it is a way to speak to a woman who quoted the Bible to me my whole life, and then desecrates one of Ethan Allen\xe2\x80\x99s finest sofas.\nMrs Cooper: I will give you one opportunity, young man, to apologize.\nSheldon: Or what?\nMrs Cooper: Or I will send you to your room.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s ridiculous. I am a grown man. I am a professional scientist. And I currently occupy the moral high ground.\nMrs Cooper: Go to your room.\nSheldon: But I occupy the moral high ground.\nMrs Cooper: Go to your room.\nSheldon: But I\xe2\x80\x99m a professional scientist.\nMrs: Go to your room!\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m a grown man.\nScene: The apartment.\nRaj: Can we please get back to the game?\nLeonard: In a minute. I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand why any success you have in acting is more important than any I have in science.\nPenny: Okay, if you do something cool in science, you might change the world. If I become a famous actress, I\xe2\x80\x99m not gonna tell you why movie stars are the best. They just are.\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99m surprised you guys never talked about this stuff.\nLeonard: Like you and Sheldon have everything figured out?\nAmy: Actually, our relationship agreement covers a wide array of scenarios, including career changes, financial instability, intelligent dog uprising. FYI, we plan on selling out the human race hard.\nPenny: In 20 years, who knows what\xe2\x80\x99ll happen with any of us?\nStuart: I think you and Leonard will be together.\nPenny: You do?\nStuart: Yeah. I think you\xe2\x80\x99re the best couple I know.\nLeonard: Aw.\nPenny: That\xe2\x80\x99s so sweet.\nBernadette: What the hell?\nAmy: Excuse me?\nPenny: Ah-da-da-da-da, let the dead man talk. So, why do you think that?\nStuart: Uh, well, I feel like you guys make each other better. Penny brought Leonard out of his shell. And it seems like Leonard makes Penny think more deeply about the world. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Together, you two kind of make one awesome person.\nPenny: Aw, Stuart. Now I feel bad for murdering you.\nRaj: Oh, come on.\nBernadette: Penny did it, I win. Suck it, jackasses.\nScene: Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s old bedroom.\nHoward: Hey, can I come in?\nSheldon: Apparently any man is welcome in this house. Why not you? I thought you were waiting in the car.\nHoward: That was an hour ago, Sheldon. A Jew sits in front of a house in Texas that long, For Sale signs start to go up. I take it things didn\xe2\x80\x99t go smoothly with your mom.\nSheldon: No. I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure how we\xe2\x80\x99re going to get past this.\nHoward: You know, I, I sort of went through something like this myself.\nSheldon: Howard, we\xe2\x80\x99ve all seen your mother naked. That woman needs to learn how to tie a robe.\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about when my mom started seeing someone a couple of years after my dad left.\nSheldon: I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know she did.\nHoward: Yeah, she was dating this guy, and I was kind of a jerk to her about it.\nSheldon: What did you do?\nHoward: Well, let\xe2\x80\x99s just say it was the most vicious bar mitzvah speech in the history of Temple Beth El. Anyway, she broke up with him. And she\xe2\x80\x99s basically been alone ever since. She never said it, but I always felt I was the reason why.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. Although, based on your story, you absolutely were the reason why.\nHoward: All I\xe2\x80\x99m saying is you might not want to get in the way of your mom\xe2\x80\x99s happiness.\nSheldon: You may have a point. I love my mother. Even if she fornicates like a demonic weasel.\nHoward: And the healing begins.\nScene: Mrs Cooper\xe2\x80\x99s living room.\nSheldon: Hello.\nMrs Cooper: Hello. Are you ready to discuss this calmly, like adults?\nSheldon: I am.\nMrs Cooper: Shelly, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry that you saw what you saw. I know that this is hard for you.\nSheldon: I think what most upsets me about it, Mother, is the hypocrisy. Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t this contradict all the religious rules you\xe2\x80\x99ve been espousing your whole life?\nMrs Cooper: You\xe2\x80\x99re right, it does, and it\xe2\x80\x99s something that I\xe2\x80\x99m struggling with these days.\nSheldon: Then why are you doing it?\nMrs Cooper: Because I\xe2\x80\x99m not perfect, Shelly. And that man\xe2\x80\x99s booty is.\nSheldon: Well, this is confusing for me. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to stand in the way of your happiness. So, I\xe2\x80\x99ll condemn you internally while maintaining an outward appearance of acceptance.\nMrs Cooper: That is very Christian of you.\nSheldon: Mother, if you\xe2\x80\x99re going to conduct your life in this fashion, then I should let you know that the world has changed since you were a young woman. You know, it\xe2\x80\x99s not all sock hops, soda jerks and segregation anymore.\nMrs Cooper: How old do you think I am?\nSheldon: My point is that you\xe2\x80\x99re going to need to be careful. You used to be protected by your pre-Enlightenment mythology, but now you\xe2\x80\x99re going to need a stronger friend named latex.\nMrs Cooper: Are you having the sex talk with me?\nSheldon: Well, someone has to.\nMrs Cooper: Oh, dear Lord.\nSheldon: No, don\xe2\x80\x99t look to Him. He\xe2\x80\x99s mad at you right now.\nScene: The apartment.\nPenny: Oh, come on, don\xe2\x80\x99t pout. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry I ruined your game.\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99m not pouting, I\xe2\x80\x99m brooding. Which is how sexy men pout.\nAmy: It actually was kind of fun.\nRaj: You\xe2\x80\x99re just saying that.\nAmy: Yeah.\nBernadette: I liked the time travel element.\nRaj: Thank you. I thought it was inspired.\nLeonard: It was. By Terminator.\nBernadette: Well, I hope 20 years from now, we really are all still together and still friends.\nPenny: Definitely.\nLeonard: Of course. Well, hey, how about this? Whether we\xe2\x80\x99re friends, not friends, scattered around the world, no matter what, let\xe2\x80\x99s all promise to meet in front of this building exactly 20 years from tonight at 8:00 p.m. and have dinner like we always do.\nBernadette: Aw.\nPenny: I love it.\nLeonard: Putting it in my phone right now.\nPenny: Yeah, me, too.\nStuart: My phone doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have a calendar. So I\xe2\x80\x99ll just write it on my hand.\nRaj: And it\xe2\x80\x99s done.\nPenny: Yup, we\xe2\x80\x99re all in.\nLeonard: All right, I\xe2\x80\x99ll see you guys in 20 years.\nScene: In front of the building, 20 years later.\nStuart: I knew it.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
