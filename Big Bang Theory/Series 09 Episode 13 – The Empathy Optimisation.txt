b'Scene: The apartment.\nPenny: Hey, so I saw a movie trailer the other day. How could Batman possibly fight Superman? I mean, isn\xe2\x80\x99t that dumb?\nBernadette: Maybe he uses Kryptonite.\nEmily: Well, Batman\xe2\x80\x99s got a lot of money. Maybe he builds a suit that can do everything Superman can do.\nPenny: No, no, no, no, no. I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen that movie. It\xe2\x80\x99s called Iron Man.\nLeonard: What is happening?\nHoward: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\nRaj: But it\xe2\x80\x99s beautiful.\nPenny: And now Ben Affleck is Batman?\nEmily: Oh, he was great in Shakespeare in Love.\nPenny: Ooh, we should watch that next girls\xe2\x80\x99 night.\nBernadette: We could do a double feature with the Leonardo Di Caprio Romeo and Juliet.\nPenny: Oh, I love me some Leo.\nLeonard: And it\xe2\x80\x99s gone.\nSheldon: Oh, hello, everyone. I am happy to report I\xe2\x80\x99m feeling much better.\nLeonard: Good for you.\nSheldon: My fever is gone, my sinuses are pressure-free, and my mucus is as clear as a Yosemite waterfall.\nHoward: Glad to hear it.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to return to work tomorrow.\nRaj: Yay.\nSheldon: Well, why isn\xe2\x80\x99t everyone happy? Your little ray of sunshine is ready to beam again.\nPenny: You really don\xe2\x80\x99t know why?\nSheldon: No. But I knew that his yay was sarcastic. Not bad for a guy whose last bowel movement sounded like rain on a roof.\nLeonard: Let me refresh your memory.\nFlashback\nSheldon: Penny, rub Vicks on my chest.\nPenny: Sheldon, I cooked you breakfast. I made your bed. I checked your mouth for thrush. You can rub your own chest.\nSheldon: Oh, sure, grope every other male on the planet, but draw the line with me.\nFlashback\nBernadette: I brought you a little care package from work. It\xe2\x80\x99s our latest antiviral and the best decongestant we make.\nSheldon: I hope laughter is the best medicine, \xe2\x80\x99cause this care package is a joke.\nHoward: Hey, she came all the way here\xe2\x80\xa6\nBernadette: You\xe2\x80\x99re gonna want to take these with food.\nFlashback\nRaj: Sheldon, stop being a baby and let Emily take a look at you.\nSheldon: She\xe2\x80\x99s a dermatologist.\nEmily: I went to medical school.\nSheldon: Well, in that case, try removing the irritating patch of brown skin standing next to you.\nFlashback\nLeonard: All right, here you go.\nSheldon: Leonard, I\xe2\x80\x99m dying.\nLeonard: You\xe2\x80\x99re not dying. It\xe2\x80\x99s just the flu.\nSheldon: I asked for chicken noodle. This is chicken and stars. It\xe2\x80\x99s killing me.\nBack to the present.\nSheldon: I never did get that chicken noodle, did I?\nCredits sequence.\nScene: Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom.\nAmy (on Skype): Hi, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Hello.\nAmy: Are you feeling any better?\nSheldon: Physically, yes, but I\xe2\x80\x99m upset because everyone\xe2\x80\x99s mad at me for no good reason.\nAmy: Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you tell me what happened, and in a gentle, loving way, I\xe2\x80\x99ll explain to you why you\xe2\x80\x99re wrong.\nSheldon: You know how, when you\xe2\x80\x99re sick, you\xe2\x80\x99re allowed to be cranky and say whatever you want and other people\xe2\x80\x99s feelings don\xe2\x80\x99t matter?\nAmy: Ooh. Gentle and loving, this is gonna be tricky.\nSheldon: I had a hundred and one fever. If that\xe2\x80\x99s not a time to verbally abuse my loved ones, when is?\nAmy: Sheldon, when you\xe2\x80\x99re sick, you can be unbearable. That\xe2\x80\x99s why your friends have been known to work late or sneak out to the movies or stay at a neurobiology conference three days after it\xe2\x80\x99s ended.\nSheldon: You stayed in Michigan all week to avoid being around me?\nAmy: No, no, not just that. I mean, Detroit is beautiful when it\xe2\x80\x99s sleeting.\nSheldon: You know, I\xe2\x80\x99m not the only one who\xe2\x80\x99s unpleasant when they\xe2\x80\x99re sick. When Penny got food poisoning, she threw up so loudly I could barely hear the television.\nAmy: Ooh, I just heard something. Might be hail, might be gunfire. Either way, I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna go take pictures. Bye.\nScene: The comic book store.\nRaj: Hey, Stuart.\nStuart: Hey. Where\xe2\x80\x99s Sheldon? Still sick?\nLeonard: No, he\xe2\x80\x99s fine. We just needed a little break.\nStuart: Yeah, I get that. When I brought him his comics the other day he said, oh great, death is literally at my door.\nHoward: He was being a jerk to everyone. Don\xe2\x80\x99t take it personally.\nStuart: Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m on so many antidepressants, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t if I wanted to.\nRaj: I wish we could do more stuff without Sheldon.\nLeonard: I wish that all the time. Usually before I blow out birthday candles.\nHoward: You know, Amy took some time off from him. Really improved their relationship.\nRaj: Huh. Okay. As long as it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t end with us having coitus with him, I\xe2\x80\x99m in.\nHoward: We should all take a trip or something.\nLeonard: Well, you know, Penny and I have been talking about taking a weekend in Vegas. Maybe we should all go.\nHoward: Bernie would love that.\nRaj: Oh, Ooh, maybe we could get one of those party buses to take us there.\nLeonard: That sounds really fun.\nRaj: Yeah, that sounds fun. A party-bus party don\xe2\x80\x99t stop. Ooh, when I say party, you say bus.\nLeonard: No.\nHoward: No.\nLeonard: No.\nHoward: No.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: So, the guys and I were talking about renting a party bus and everyone going to Vegas.\nPenny: Oh, that could be fun. But just to be clear, you mean a party bus with booze and music, right, not, like, juice boxes and video games?\nLeonard: Yes. And Howard\xe2\x80\x99s birthday was a drop-off party, you didn\xe2\x80\x99t have to stay.\nPenny: Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m in. When are we going?\nLeonard: This weekend.\nSheldon: Oh, where are we going?\nLeonard: Well, Vegas, but\xe2\x80\xa6\nSheldon: Ugh, Atlantic City without the taffy? No, thank you.\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99s fine, \xe2\x80\x99cause actually you\xe2\x80\x99re not invited.\nSheldon: Well, now, well, that\xe2\x80\x99s hurtful.\nPenny: Oh, Sheldon, you don\xe2\x80\x99t even like it there.\nSheldon: I can consider a place America\xe2\x80\x99s urinal cake and still enjoy the occasional visit.\nLeonard: Not this time.\nSheldon: Oh, fine. Then I\xe2\x80\x99ll just hang out with Wolowitz.\nLeonard: He\xe2\x80\x99s coming, too.\nSheldon: Well, then Raj and I will\xe2\x80\xa6\nLeonard: Nope.\nSheldon: Very well. Stuart.\nLeonard: Oh, great. Do that.\nSheldon: Ugh. Stuart.\nScene: Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom.\nAmy (on Skype): Hi, Sheldon. What\xe2\x80\x99s new?\nSheldon: Our friends are jerks, and I\xe2\x80\x99m mad at all of them.\nAmy: I said what\xe2\x80\x99s new, but sure.\nSheldon: Can you believe they planned a trip to Las Vegas and didn\xe2\x80\x99t invite me?\nAmy: Did you refuse to apologize and act like they were stupid for being mad?\nSheldon: You know, I liked it better when there was still a little mystery left in our relationship.\nAmy: Everyone tried to take care of you, and you were nothing but mean to them.\nSheldon: I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe you\xe2\x80\x99re not on my side. I was on your side when someone stole your car radio.\nAmy: Who else\xe2\x80\x99s side could you have been on?\nSheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. A music-loving hobo with a heart of gold?\nAmy: Sheldon, I understand that you\xe2\x80\x99re upset because you feel left out, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why we\xe2\x80\x99re even talking about this. Just apologize to them.\nSheldon: Fine, if that\xe2\x80\x99s what it takes to go on their dumb trip.\nAmy: Maybe you could try apologizing because you actually feel bad. It\xe2\x80\x99s called empathy. It\xe2\x80\x99s something you could work on.\nSheldon: I have empathy. Watch. Leonard made me soup, and I was mean to him.\nAmy: Great. Now try it as if this isn\xe2\x80\x99t your first day as a person.\nSheldon: Fine. Leonard made me soup, and I was mean to him. Hey, I felt a little something. Let me try again. Leonard made me soup, and I was mean to him. I was mean to him. He must have felt terrible. Oh, now I feel terrible. Neat.\nAmy: Glad I could help.\nSheldon: Now let me see you feel bad for lying and staying in Detroit longer than you needed to.\nAmy: I feel so, so bad.\nSheldon: Hey, we\xe2\x80\x99re both great at this.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Leonard, get ready for an apology. And with the added twist of an M. Night Shyamalan movie, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to mean it.\nLeonard: Ah, so like every other M. Night Shyamalan movie I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen, you spoil it in advance.\nSheldon: Hey, if you didn\xe2\x80\x99t know Bruce Willis was dead the whole time, that\xe2\x80\x99s not on me. Okay. Here it comes. You tried to take care of me when I was sick, and I was mean to you. There\xe2\x80\x99s no excuse for that. And I\xe2\x80\x99m truly sorry.\nLeonard: Thank you. I appreciate that.\nSheldon: I want you to know that that is sincere. I do feel bad. I\xe2\x80\x99m not just saying it to be included on your trip.\nLeonard: Appreciate that, too.\nSheldon: Terrific. Now all that\xe2\x80\x99s left is for you to invite me to come, me to ask are you sure, you to say absolutely, and then me to bring it home with, how could I say no to that face?\nLeonard: You\xe2\x80\x99re still not coming.\nSheldon: What? I apologized and I meant it. I know that we don\xe2\x80\x99t play this game very often, but you\xe2\x80\x99re doing it wrong.\nLeonard: Sheldon, I accept your apology, but you upset a lot of people while you were sick. I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to just say you can come.\nSheldon: Well, all right. What if I apologize to all of them?\nLeonard: Fine, if you apologize to everyone, they all say it\xe2\x80\x99s okay, then yes, you can come.\nSheldon: Challenge accepted. Sounds like it\xe2\x80\x99s time for the Sheldon Cooper Apology Tour.\nLeonard: Well, I hope it\xe2\x80\x99s as much fun as the Sheldon Cooper Spell-Checks Local Menus Tour.\nSheldon: My goodness, do you remember comes with apsparagus?\nScene: Howard and Berndette\xe2\x80\x99s house.\nSheldon: Howard and Bernadette, you tried to comfort me when I was ill, and I treated you terribly. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.\nHoward: Wow. I\xe2\x80\x99m impressed.\nSheldon: No, no, no, wait. I\xe2\x80\x99m not done. Allow me to underscore my sentiment with a haunting rendition of Brenda Lee\xe2\x80\x99s I\xe2\x80\x99m Sorry played on the pan flute.\nHoward: Apology accepted.\nBernadette: Forgiven, forgiven.\nSheldon: All right, that\xe2\x80\x99s eight hours of practice down the drain. And to memorialise this occasion, here are your commemorative T-shirts.\nHoward: Sheldon Cooper apologized to me\nBernadette: And he made it all better.\nScene: The apartment bathroom.\nSheldon: All you did was offer maternal care and affection, and all you received in return was rude and insensitive behavior.\nPenny: Can this wait?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid it can\xe2\x80\x99t. The trip is tomorrow. And I have more apologies to make.\nPenny: Okay, fine, I accept your apology, now get out.\nSheldon: Wonderful. would you mind holding up this shirt while I take a quick\xe2\x80\xa6?\nPenny: Leonard.\nScene: The comic book store.\nSheldon: You brought me my comic books when I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t feeling well. That, that was thoughtful. And I was insensitive. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.\nStuart: Thank you, Sheldon. I appreciate that.\nSheldon: And I want you to know that I mean it, you know? This isn\xe2\x80\x99t me just wanting to go on the trip to Las Vegas.\nStuart: What trip to Las Vegas?\nSheldon: The one everyone\xe2\x80\x99s taking this weekend on the party bus.\nStuart: Of course, I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t invited.\nSheldon: That would be my understanding. On a less painful subject, what size T-shirt do you take?\nScene: Raj\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nSheldon: Raj, you were being a good friend, and my illness was no excuse for my behaviour. I hope that you can accept my apology.\nRaj: Of course I do.\nSheldon: And, Emily, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry for saying dermatologists aren\xe2\x80\x99t real doctors. And I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you\xe2\x80\x99re tired of hearing that.\nEmily: Do you honestly think I hear that a lot?\nSheldon: Well, I would imagine when your job is popping zits and squirting Botox into old lady faces\xe2\x80\xa6\nRaj: Okay, okay, the point is that we accept your apology.\nEmily: Uh, maybe you do. He just insulted me again.\nRaj: Yeah, but he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean it.\nEmily: Why are you defending him?\nSheldon: I believe I can answer that. Uh, like me, Raj is demonstrating empathy. Now, why don\xe2\x80\x99t you accept my apology receive your free T-shirt, uh, I hope extra small is okay. For some reason Wolowitz took a medium.\nEmily: Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t accept your apology.\nRaj: What are you doing?\nEmily: It\xe2\x80\x99s called standing up for myself. You should try it some time.\nRaj: Fine, how about this? You\xe2\x80\x99re making me uncomfortable by prolonging this ridiculous fight, and I wish you\xe2\x80\x99d stop.\nEmily: Oh, you want me to stop? No problem.\nRaj: No, come on, please don\xe2\x80\x99t leave.\nSheldon: Point of clarification, are you still going on the trip? Because if not\xe2\x80\xa6\nEmily: Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry, you\xe2\x80\x99re good.\nSheldon: I caused that fight, I feel terrible. Wait, I can do that better. I caused that fight. I feel terrible. Yeah, wow, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know which one I like more.\nScene: The apartment.\nPenny: So, was the fight really bad?\nSheldon: No. As a fight, it was excellent. She used harsh language and slammed the door. Although as I say this, that might not have been what you were asking.\nLeonard: You think they\xe2\x80\x99ll still go on the trip?\nSheldon: All I know is after the fight I went to Emily\xe2\x80\x99s to smooth\xe2\x80\xa6\nLeonard: They\xe2\x80\x99re not going on the trip.\nPenny: No.\nRaj: What is wrong with you?\nSheldon: Look at him, caring about what\xe2\x80\x99s wrong with me. That is some top-shelf empathy. Hey, well, we should start a club.\nRaj: You went to Emily\xe2\x80\x99s to apologise, and when you left, she was crying.\nSheldon: That is true. Well, I suppose I should apologize again.\nAll: No.\nPenny: Is she okay?\nRaj: Yeah, I calmed her down, but she\xe2\x80\x99s not going to Vegas if he\xe2\x80\x99s going.\nHoward: Wait, that\xe2\x80\x99s an option? I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know that was an option.\nSheldon: Well, that is fine, because I\xe2\x80\x99ve decided that I won\xe2\x80\x99t be joining you. I\xe2\x80\x99ve realized that the most genuine way to demonstrate the remorse I feel is to let you have this weekend to yourselves.\nRaj: That\xe2\x80\x99s very mature of you.\nSheldon: Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been on a little trip myself recently. Not to Sin City but to Sincere City. Where instead of genital warts, the only growth you\xe2\x80\x99ll come back with is personal growth.\nPenny: And there\xe2\x80\x99s your next T-shirt.\nScene: The party bus.\nHoward: Ooh, check out the stripper pole.\nBernadette: You know what that means.\nLeonard: That Raj\xe2\x80\x99ll be on it before we make it to the freeway?\nRaj: You know it. Oo-ah, oo-ah.\nBernadette: This is so cool.\nPenny: Here\xe2\x80\x99s some champagne.\nLeonard: Mm-hmm. Well, I would like to propose a toast to a well-deserved weekend of\xe2\x80\xa6\nSheldon: Aha.\nLeonard: What are you doing?\nSheldon: My plan was to jump out at the state line, but one of my nose plugs fell into the toilet.\nPenny: You couldn\xe2\x80\x99t give us just one weekend?\nStuart: I told him this was a bad idea.\nLeonard: What do we do, kick them off?\nPenny: If we drop them off at a fire station, they have to take them, no questions asked.\nSheldon: Before you do, please give me one more chance to apologize to Emily.\nRaj: Oh, God.\nSheldon: Emily, as I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you know, I\xe2\x80\x99m considered an odd fellow. But what you don\xe2\x80\x99t know is that, while I often say the wrong thing, in my heart I mean well. I think that you are a smart and wonderful woman, you know? And we all think that you can do better than Koothrappali.\nRaj: You know, Sheldon\xe2\x80\xa6\nEmily: Shh, let him finish.\nSheldon: So, for all the times I\xe2\x80\x99ve offended you and all the times that I\xe2\x80\x99ll offend you in the future, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.\nEmily: Thank you.\nSheldon: Good. Then I\xe2\x80\x99ll be leaving now.\nEmily: Oh, it\xe2\x80\x99s okay, Sheldon. Come with us.\nSheldon: Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s very kind of you. But I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you\xe2\x80\x99ll all have a better time without me. Let\xe2\x80\x99s go, Stuart.\nStuart: But I want to stay.\nSheldon: Stuart, now.\nEmily: You know, I know he\xe2\x80\x99s a jerk, but I actually feel bad for him.\nPenny: And now you see the problem.\nLeonard: Come on, you pain in the ass.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s me. Bye, Stuart.\nStuart: Wait. I\xe2\x80\x99m a pain in the ass, too.\nScene: Later on the party bus.\nSheldon: Are you relieved that you and Raj were able to patch things up?\nEmily: At the moment? No, not really.\nPenny: Shake it, baby.\nBernadette: Ooh, work that thing.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
