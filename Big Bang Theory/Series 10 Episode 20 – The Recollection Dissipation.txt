b'Scene: The apartment.\nPenny: Hey, Leonard, if you\xe2\x80\x99re not busy tomorrow, I have to do a little reception after work.\nLeonard: Oh, I would, but we need to make a push on the air force project.\nPenny: Oh, are you sure? We\xe2\x80\x99re celebrating our new ADD drug, and it\xe2\x80\x99ll probably be over in, like, six minutes.\nAmy: Did you say you guys are working on the guidance system tomorrow?\nLeonard: Yeah, why?\nAmy: Well, Sheldon said that he was gonna work with me on our quantum perception project.\nLeonard: We\xe2\x80\x99ve had this planned for a week.\nAmy: Well, he reconfirmed with me this morning.\nRaj: Guys, before this gets ugly, remember, the winner gets Sheldon.\nPenny: Hey, Raj, do you want to go with me tomorrow?\nRaj: Are you asking because you want me there or out of pity? Actually, never mind, don\xe2\x80\x99t answer. I\xe2\x80\x99d love to.\nSheldon: Hello.\nAmy: Why did you tell Leonard you\xe2\x80\x99re working on the gyroscope tomorrow?\nSheldon: Because I am.\nAmy: But you said you were working with me.\nPenny: Uh-oh. Someone\xe2\x80\x99s got two dates to the nerd prom.\nSheldon: I have a plan to work on both projects simultaneously. And for your information, the summer conference on algebraic topology at Caltech is nerd prom.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, what is this plan you have?\nSheldon: Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not needed at both places at the same time. And I can also free up extra hours with simple tricks, such as using a minimal amount of words to convey my point.\nLeonard: When does that start?\nSheldon: Soon. See, I could\xe2\x80\x99ve said in the near future, but I didn\xe2\x80\x99t say in the near future, because in the near future is three more words than soon. In, one, the, two, near, three, future, four. See, in the near future is four, soon is just one, four is more than one, saving time already.\nRaj: Genius. I was gonna say, why does anyone think Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s a genius? But I didn\xe2\x80\x99t.\nScene: The guys laboratory.\nSheldon: Gentlemen, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got Amy up and running. Shall we get to work?\nHoward: Uh, before we do, what are you wearing, oh, friend who we pretend is normal?\nSheldon: These are hydration backpacks. For efficiency, whenever I\xe2\x80\x99m thirsty I have access to water. When I\xe2\x80\x99m hungry, I have lentil soup.\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s getting harder to pretend.\nHoward: Anyway, Sheldon, we\xe2\x80\x99re at a decision point to run the xenon stream through the cryo-cooler or through the vacuum filter.\nSheldon: Run down the pros and cons of each for me.\nHoward: Well, if we run the xenon stream through the cryo-cooler, it\xe2\x80\x99ll be cooled immediately before it reacts with the conduction.\nSheldon: Oh, sorry, uh, carrot chunk.\nHoward: You can just feel the time being saved.\nScene: Amy\xe2\x80\x99s laboratory\nSheldon: Ah, I\xe2\x80\x99m back, you got me for eight minutes.\nAmy: Sheldon, this is silly. You can\xe2\x80\x99t expect us to do quality work with you popping in and out like this.\nSheldon: The coefficient isn\xe2\x80\x99t lambda, it\xe2\x80\x99s lambda sub one. And over here, you should consider the possibility that the brain itself is in two different quantum states. And lastly, do you have any little soup crackers?\nScene: The guys laboratory\nHoward: The rate of spinning for the central axis centrifuge has to be four revolutions per second.\nLeonard: It can\xe2\x80\x99t be four revolutions, it\xe2\x80\x99s got to be seven.\nHoward: Seven? Look at the board, it\xe2\x80\x99s four.\nLeonard: Oh, my God, it\xe2\x80\x99s seven.\nHoward: Four.\n\xe2\x80\x93\nLeonard: Seven.\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s five and a half.\nHoward: Son of a bitch, it\xe2\x80\x99s five and a half.\nSheldon: BRB. That\xe2\x80\x99s short for be right back. I\xe2\x80\x99m saving so much time.\nScene: Amy\xe2\x80\x99s laboratory.\nSheldon: The two signals meet up in the corpus callosum and T equals zero. And I know a boy who just earned a slurp of soup.\nAmy: Incredible. Sheldon, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t expect that you could work on both projects, but I, I was wrong.\nSheldon: You know, I felt the same way about the spork. Uh, solids and liquids handled by one utensil? That\xe2\x80\x99ll never work. Spoiler, works.\nScene: The guys laboratory.\nLeonard: I got to admit, we didn\xe2\x80\x99t think you\xe2\x80\x99d be able to do two things at once.\nSheldon: Yeah, I felt the same way about the platypus. You know, bird and mammal in the same creature? No way. And spoiler, way.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s kitchen.\nStuart: Hey.\nBernadette: Hey.\nStuart: Oh, thanks again for letting me use your laptop last night.\nBernadette: No problem.\nStuart: Was just doing my taxes.\nBernadette: Okay.\nStuart: Actually, if I could, if I could just check one more\xe2\x80\xa6\nBernadette: Already cleared the browser history.\nStuart: You\xe2\x80\x99re a good woman. What you working on?\nBernadette: Trying to catch up on office e-mails before I go back.\nStuart: Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s right, maternity leave\xe2\x80\x99s almost over. Ah, you excited?\nBernadette: Yeah, I mean, I\xe2\x80\x99ll miss Halley, but it\xe2\x80\x99ll be nice to get out of the house, be intellectually stimulated. Go out to lunch instead of, you know, be lunch.\nStuart: That\xe2\x80\x99s great, good for you.\nBernadette: Yeah, I mean, with you and my parents, she\xe2\x80\x99s gonna be fine.\nStuart: Ah, of course she is.\nBernadette: And that day care is great.\nStuart: It is. I went to check it out, and they are very cautious about letting strange men with no kids peek in the windows.\nBernadette: Plus, I, I think I\xe2\x80\x99m setting a good example for Halley, to show her that women can be mothers and still have satisfying careers. Sure, she won\xe2\x80\x99t know where I went or if I\xe2\x80\x99m ever coming back. That\xe2\x80\x99ll just make the ten minutes between when I get home and her bedtime even more special.\nStuart: Uh, other than burp you or give you a bottle, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to do right now.\nBernadette: It\xe2\x80\x99s okay, I\xe2\x80\x99m just being emotional about this. Can you not tell Howard?\nStuart: Well, don\xe2\x80\x99t you think it\xe2\x80\x99d be healthier if you told him what\xe2\x80\x99s going on with you?\nBernadette: Don\xe2\x80\x99t you think it\xe2\x80\x99d be healthier if you had your own apartment, grown man?\nStuart: Your secret is safe with me.\nScene: The laundry room.\nPenny: Hey, since when do you do laundry on a Thursday?\nSheldon: Oh, I had an accident at work, I slipped and fell on my soup sack.\nPenny: You know, there was a time I would say what\xe2\x80\x99s a soup sack? But I\xe2\x80\x99m glad we\xe2\x80\x99re past that. (Sheldon sneezes) You know, there was a time I would say God bless you, and then you would say if you must invoke an imaginary deity, how about Thor? And I would say, how do you know I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean Thor? And then you would say Touch\xc3\xa9, and that there ends the tale of why I no longer say\nGod bless you.\nSheldon: Well, we have had some fun, haven\xe2\x80\x99t we?\nPenny: Oh, yeah. So, Leonard tells me you\xe2\x80\x99ve had a busy day.\nSheldon: Hmm? Oh, I did. It hasn\xe2\x80\x99t stopped. I figured out a solution for our navigation system while I was pre-soaking lentils out of my pants.\nPenny: Are you getting sick?\nSheldon: Of course not. I\xe2\x80\x99m too busy to be sick.\nPenny: Well, you\xe2\x80\x99re pretty delicate. Maybe you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be pushing yourself so hard.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m fine.\nPenny: All right. Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ll just pretend that you didn\xe2\x80\x99t catch a cold watching Frozen.\nSheldon: That didn\xe2\x80\x99t happen.\nPenny: You also got a nosebleed watching Up.\nSheldon: Just do your laundry.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s kitchen.\nBernadette: Stuart, you didn\xe2\x80\x99t have to make dinner.\nStuart: Yeah, well, I felt bad about upsetting you this morning. And to be honest, I\xe2\x80\x99m not the biggest fan of your meatloaf.\nHoward: Hey, what\xe2\x80\x99s for dinner?\nBernadette: Meatloaf.\nHoward: Oh, cool.\nBernadette: Stuart made it.\nHoward: Oh, cool. Hey, I was thinking maybe we take Halley to the zoo this weekend, get in a little family time before you go back to work.\nBernadette: Sounds great.\nHoward: Speaking of which, for day care, it\xe2\x80\x99ll be easy for me to drop her off, unless you want to do it.\nBernadette: Hmm, guess it should be me.\nStuart: I can\xe2\x80\x99t do it. They have a picture of me on file now.\nHoward: You okay?\nBernadette: Of course, why?\nHoward: Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, you seem a little upset.\nBernadette: No, I\xe2\x80\x99m fine.\nHoward: You sure?\nStuart: Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you think she\xe2\x80\x99s fine? She sounds fine, she looks fine. If I saw her on the street I\xe2\x80\x99d say, damn, that girl\xe2\x80\x99s fine.\nScene: Sheldon and Amy\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nAmy: Sheldon, you\xe2\x80\x99re sick, go back to bed.\nSheldon: I am fine. Here, eat your toast. (Sneezes) Sorry.\nAmy: It\xe2\x80\x99s okay, now I don\xe2\x80\x99t need butter.\nSheldon: Well, perhaps I am a little under the weather. It\xe2\x80\x99s nothing a little cold medicine and tea can\xe2\x80\x99t fix.\nAmy: You need sleep.\nSheldon: What I need is to get to work.\nAmy: Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want your germs around me.\nSheldon: What? You hold my hand, you kiss my mouth, but you draw the line at a hundred and two fever? What happened to our love?\nScene: The apartment.\nAmy: Sheldon, are you okay?\nSheldon: What\xe2\x80\x99s going on? How\xe2\x80\x99d I get here?\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, we came home from work and we found you.\nSheldon: Home from work? What time is it?\nPenny: It\xe2\x80\x99s nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\nSheldon: Nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock? What happened to eight and seven and all the other o\xe2\x80\x99clocks?\nRaj: Wait, you don\xe2\x80\x99t remember?\nSheldon: Well, I remember waking up in the morning, Amy rubbing Vicks on my chest. And her hands were like two frozen chunks of tundra. I took some cold medicine to\xe2\x80\xa6 I took cold medicine.\nLeonard: You did seem a little loopy when you showed up at the lab.\nSheldon: At, at the lab? Why am I naked from the waist down?\nRaj: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know where your pants are, but we did find your underwear in a pot on the stove.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: My pants are missing, I don\xe2\x80\x99t remember anything. Penny, this is your youth. What do I do?\nPenny: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, check your body for tattoos?\nSheldon: Leonard, would you be a lamb?\nLeonard: She\xe2\x80\x99s kidding.\nSheldon: Wait, wait. Where\xe2\x80\x99s my bag? My phone and my wallet are in my bag.\nRaj: It\xe2\x80\x99s right here.\nSheldon: Where\xe2\x80\x99s my notebook? My notebook\xe2\x80\x99s gone. Oh, no.\nPenny: Okay, it\xe2\x80\x99s just a notebook, what\xe2\x80\x99s the big deal?\nSheldon: What\xe2\x80\x99s the big deal? It\xe2\x80\x99s full of classified information about the air force project.\nLeonard: How could you lose that?\nAmy: It\xe2\x80\x99s okay, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure we\xe2\x80\x99ll find it.\nPenny: Look, it\xe2\x80\x99s got to be around here somewhere.\nAmy: Maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s wherever your pants are.\nRaj: Nope, pants in the microwave, no notebook.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s kitchen.\nHoward: Hey.\nStuart: Ah, hello.\nHoward: Look, something\xe2\x80\x99s going on with Bernadette. She say anything to you?\nStuart: Well, nope, not a word.\nHoward: Come on, be honest. Did you tell her I tried her breast pump?\nStuart: No, but I did mention it to my therapist.\nHoward: Well, I know she\xe2\x80\x99s mad at me about something.\nStuart: Well, what have you done that would upset her?\nHoward: Oh, gosh, how much time do you have?\nStuart: Well, why don\xe2\x80\x99t you just start with the worst thing?\nHoward: Hmm, let\xe2\x80\x99s see. Mm. Okay, here we go, six years ago, I got a call that Bernie\xe2\x80\x99s great-aunt, Trixie, died.\nStuart: And?\nHoward: And I forgot to give her the message.\nStuart: That\xe2\x80\x99s terrible.\nHoward: The terrible part is, ever since then, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been sending Bernie Christmas cards from Trixie.\nStuart: Oh Howard.\nHoward: Let me finish, and one card had five dollars in it I took from Bernie\xe2\x80\x99s purse.\nScene: The apartment.\nPenny: The notebook isn\xe2\x80\x99t in the bathroom.\nAmy: I can\xe2\x80\x99t find it, either. How can he not remember a day?\nPenny: Well, people who are abducted by aliens lose time. I mean, maybe it happens to the aliens, too.\nLeonard: Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s not across the hall.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s it. I\xe2\x80\x99m in breach of my security clearance. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to prison. And you know what happens to people like me in prison. I\xe2\x80\x99ll be forced to be some large man\xe2\x80\x99s tutor.\nRaj: You\xe2\x80\x99re not going to prison.\nLeonard: But, boy, it is funny to think about.\nAmy: You really can\xe2\x80\x99t remember anything?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m trying.\nRaj: Wait a minute. Hey, let me see your phone.\nSheldon: Why?\nRaj: Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s, it\xe2\x80\x99s possible it was tracking everywhere you went.\nAmy: Phones can do that?\nRaj: Yeah, it depends on the privacy settings.\nPenny: Oh, that, that\xe2\x80\x99s so cool. How do you, how do you turn that thing off?\nLeonard: Relax. I know when you go for a run, you stop for a donut.\nPenny: I don\xe2\x80\x99t even run there, I drive.\nRaj: Hang on, I can see every place you went.\nSheldon: What does it say?\nRaj: Uh, you were in the building, you were at the university, then you were somewhere on Colorado Boulevard.\nSheldon: Where?\nRaj: Wait, hang on. Did you go to a cowboy bar?\nSheldon: I, no, that is preposterous. Maybe.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s kitchen.\nHoward: Hey, how\xe2\x80\x99s it going?\nBernadette: Fine.\nHoward: Good. Love you.\nBernadette: Love you, too.\nHoward: Love you more.\nBernadette: Okay, you won. Can I finish what I\xe2\x80\x99m doing?\nHoward: Sure, sorry.\nBernadette: Something on your mind?\nHoward: No, no, nothing. Okay, well, maybe I\xe2\x80\x99m just feeling like something\xe2\x80\x99s bothering you.\nBernadette: Nope, all good.\nHoward: Prove it, make love to me right now on the kitchen floor.\nBernadette: No, what is wrong with you?\nHoward: Aha, you are upset. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know a lot about women, but I know I upset them.\nBernadette: Howard, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry if I\xe2\x80\x99m being weird, but it has nothing to do with you.\nHoward: It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t?\nBernadette: No. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to tell you, but I\xe2\x80\x99m having a really tough time about going back to work.\nHoward: Oh. Okay, well, I get that. It was hard for me when I went back.\nBernadette: It was?\nHoward: Of course. I missed you and the baby and being able to watch Ellen every day.\nBernadette: I just don\xe2\x80\x99t know what the right thing to do is. If I go back to work, I\xe2\x80\x99m abandoning Halley. If I don\xe2\x80\x99t go, I\xe2\x80\x99m giving up everything I worked for. It\xe2\x80\x99s like there\xe2\x80\x99s no right choice.\nHoward: Look, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what the best decision is, either. But whatever we choose, if we\xe2\x80\x99re not happy, we can undo it.\nBernadette: I guess.\nHoward: And the best part is Halley won\xe2\x80\x99t remember a thing. Babies are cute, but they\xe2\x80\x99re dumb. I mean, I go like this, she thinks I\xe2\x80\x99m gone, then magically I\xe2\x80\x99m back. I mean honestly, why are we saving for college?\nBernadette: I\xe2\x80\x99m not crazy about you calling our baby dumb.\nHoward; Well, she gets it from me. Speaking of which, I have some news about your Aunt Trixie.\nScene: A cowboy bar.\nRaj: Does this place look familiar?\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to say.\nBarman: Hey, Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s back.\nBar patrons: Sheldon!\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s getting clearer.\nBarman: You gonna buy another round for the house?\nSheldon: Uh, no, thank you. We now know why MasterCard sent me a fraud alert.\nLeonard: Ask him.\nSheldon: Um, yes. Howdy, partner. Do you happen to recollect if I left a notebook in these here parts?\nRaj: These here parts?\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s called fitting in. By the way, good luck.\nBarman: Here you go.\nSheldon: Oh, thank goodness.\nBarman: One top secret quantum guidance system.\nLeonard: You understood the math?\nBarman: No, but Sheldon told me all about it. He told everybody.\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99s just great.\nBarman: Oh, don\xe2\x80\x99t worry, he made us pinky swear we\xe2\x80\x99d keep it a secret.\nFlashback\nSheldon: I swear.\nEveryone: I swear:\nSheldon: Not to tell anyone.\nEveryone: Not to tell anyone.\nSheldon: The top secret military information I\xe2\x80\x99m about to tell you.\nEveryone: The top secret military information I\xe2\x80\x99m about to tell you.\nEnd of flashback\nSheldon: We really need to skedaddle. Thank you.\nRaj: Bye.\nBarman: See you. Should probably erase this.\nScene: Sheldon and Amy\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nSheldon: Thank you for making me tea.\nAmy: You\xe2\x80\x99re welcome. How is it?\nSheldon: Yummy. And warm on my back.\nAmy: Do you need anything else?\nSheldon: You know exactly what I need.\nAmy: Fine. Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur. Happy kitty, sleepy kitty, purr, purr, purr.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s nice. Now in German.\nAmy: Weiches K\xc3\xa4tzchen, warmes K\xc3\xa4tzchen, das nie und nimmer murrt. Liebes K\xc3\xa4tzchen, m\xc3\xbcdes K\xc3\xa4tzchen, schnurrt, schnurrt, schnurrt.\nSheldon: Great. Now Mandarin.\nAmy: Sings in Mandarin. *\nSheldon: Now Navajo.\n* (I have been unable to find a proper transcription of the Mandarin lyrics. If anyone who speaks Mandarin is able to send me a full transcription, I will include the lyrics here.)\nAdvertisements'
