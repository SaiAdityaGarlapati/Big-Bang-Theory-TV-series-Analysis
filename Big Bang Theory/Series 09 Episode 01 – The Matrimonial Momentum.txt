b'Following a \xe2\x80\x9cpreviously on\xe2\x80\x9d sequence.\nScene: A Wedding Chapel.\nPenny: So, what package are you thinking?\nLeonard: Mm, this one comes with music and flowers. Oh, they even stream the whole thing live on the Internet.\nPenny: Why would we want that?\nLeonard: \xe2\x80\x98Cause there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of gorgeous blondes out there who don\xe2\x80\x99t believe they can land a short, nearsighted scientist. Let\xe2\x80\x99s give them hope.\nPenny: Whatever. Put us on the Internet. I\xe2\x80\x99ve always wanted a wedding with a comment section.\nLeonard: If you\xe2\x80\x99re not into this, we can do it another time.\nPenny: No. No, I want to. Look, we\xe2\x80\x99ve put this off long enough. Let\xe2\x80\x99s do it.\nLeonard: Aw. That\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what you said the first time we slept together. (Phone) Oh, excuse me. Sheldon. Hey.\nSheldon: Leonard, have you gotten married yet?\nLeonard: No. Why?\nSheldon: Good. Don\xe2\x80\x99t do it.\nLeonard: Why not?\nSheldon: Some important new information has come to light. Women are the worst. I thought it was paper cuts, but I was wrong. No piece of paper ever cut me this deep.\nLeonard: What happened now?\nSheldon: Amy has ended our relationship.\nLeonard: Oh, no. Seriously?\nPenny: What\xe2\x80\x99s going on?\nLeonard: Amy broke up with Sheldon.\nPenny: She did?\nSheldon: Is Penny crying?\nLeonard: No.\nSheldon: No, of course not. They thrive on our suffering.\nLeonard: Buddy, I\xe2\x80\x99m so sorry. Is there anything I can do?\nSheldon: Yes. If I ever talk about going out with a girl again, roll your eyes at me like I do to you when you say dumb things.\nLeonard: Sheldon, uh, okay, just because you\xe2\x80\x99re going through this with Amy doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that all women are bad.\nSheldon: Whatever.\nPenny (on phone): Hey, I just heard about you and Sheldon. Are you okay?\nAmy: Not really. Can you come over?\nPenny: Uh, actually I\xe2\x80\x99m in Vegas. Leonard and I are about to get married.\nAmy: Hold on. You\xe2\x80\x99re getting married and you didn\xe2\x80\x99t invite me?\nPenny: Well, it was kind of a spur-of-the-moment thing.\nAmy: Wow. Hope I can catch the bouquet from here.\nPenny: Amy, don\xe2\x80\x99t be like that.\nSheldon: Why did I just hear Amy\xe2\x80\x99s name?\nLeonard: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s on the phone with her.\nSheldon: Did she say anything about me? Never mind. I don\xe2\x80\x99t care. Well, if you care, you can find out and tell me. Just don\xe2\x80\x99t be shocked when you find out that I don\xe2\x80\x99t care.\nPenny: Okay, will you relax? You\xe2\x80\x99re not missing anything special.\nLeonard: Hey.\nPenny: She\xe2\x80\x99s upset. Look, it\xe2\x80\x99s gonna be a great wedding. Look at you in your little suit.\nSheldon: Amy\xe2\x80\x99s upset? Is it about me?\nLeonard: No, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s because we\xe2\x80\x99re eloping.\nSheldon: Your marriage is causing her pain? Yeah, great, I take it back. Go ahead and do it. Yay for love.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: Outside Amy\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nSheldon: Hello.\nAmy: Oh. What are you doing here?\nSheldon: When last we spoke, you said you needed time.\nAmy: Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s only been 11 hours.\nSheldon: The Lord of the Rings trilogy was nearly 11 hours. I made you watch that, you said it was an eternity.\nAmy: Sheldon, when I\xe2\x80\x99m ready to talk, I\xe2\x80\x99ll let you know.\nSheldon: Very well. You seem to be headed somewhere. May I walk with you?\nAmy: Sure.\nSheldon: Boy, I\xe2\x80\x99m glad we\xe2\x80\x99re going out again.\nAmy: We\xe2\x80\x99re not back together.\nSheldon: Why? Is there someone else? Just couldn\xe2\x80\x99t wait for that first notch on your bedpost, could you?\nAmy: If you must know, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s to watch the wedding.\nSheldon: And who\xe2\x80\x99s this guy you\xe2\x80\x99re taking?\nAmy: There\xe2\x80\x99s no guy.\nSheldon: Oh, you\xe2\x80\x99re going to a wedding alone? That\xe2\x80\x99s sad.\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99m not gonna be alone. I\xe2\x80\x99ll be with my friends.\nSheldon: Your friends? Well, I think you mean my friends. And why wasn\xe2\x80\x99t I invited to this?\nAmy: Maybe because the two of us being there would make them feel awkward.\nSheldon: We make everyone feel awkward. That\xe2\x80\x99s our thing.\nScene: The Wedding Chapel.\nLeonard: They\xe2\x80\x99re running a little behind. Should be pretty soon.\nPenny: Okay.\nLeonard: Hey, if you\xe2\x80\x99re hungry, there\xe2\x80\x99s a breakfast buffet at the strip club next door.\nPenny: Thanks, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t like glitter on my scrambled eggs.\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t think the strippers prepare the meal, but okay. Look, it\xe2\x80\x99s not how I pictured it either, but I\xe2\x80\x99m still glad we\xe2\x80\x99re doing it.\nPenny: Me, too.\nLeonard: You sure?\nPenny: Yes.\nLeonard: And you promise you\xe2\x80\x99re okay with everything from the car?\nPenny: Oh, my God, would you stop bringing it up?\nLeonard: You\xe2\x80\x99re right. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. We have the rest of our lives to dredge stuff up from the past and fight about it. So what do you think? Should we run next door and grab a bite?\nPenny: What if they call our names?\nLeonard: Oh, don\xe2\x80\x99t worry. They gave me this vibrating coaster.\nPenny: Oh, and the fairy tale continues.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s House.\nAmy: Thank you for doing this.\nBernadette: Our pleasure. You feeling okay?\nAmy: We were together for so long, I honestly don\xe2\x80\x99t know what I\xe2\x80\x99m feeling.\nHoward: Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s understandable. You forgot. It\xe2\x80\x99s called happy.\nBernadette: Howard.\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m not saying anything bad. Just that she was in love with her captor and somehow managed to escape from his dark and crazy dungeon.\nStuart: I know what you\xe2\x80\x99re going through. My, my, my last breakup was pretty tough.\nAmy: Oh. What was her name?\nStuart: Hey, it\xe2\x80\x99s a true story. I don\xe2\x80\x99t need the third degree.\nBernadette: For God\xe2\x80\x99s sake, Sheldon, what are you doing?\nSheldon: I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to come in. I was told it would make everyone feel uncomfortable. So I\xe2\x80\x99ll just stay out here and pretend that I don\xe2\x80\x99t have to go to the bathroom.\nBernadette: Howard, do something.\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m on it.\nAmy: Sheldon, you being here might not be making things better.\nSheldon: I see. And is that why everybody was invited but me?\nAmy: They didn\xe2\x80\x99t invite everybody but you.Bernadette invited me, and Stuart lives here.\nRaj: Who wants hot cinnamon rolls?\nScene: The Wedding Chapel.\nOfficial: So, when you hear the music, that\xe2\x80\x99s your cue. Any questions?\nLeonard: Oh, the package that we paid for said the aisle was supposed to be strewn with rose petals.\nOfficial: Where are the rose petals?!\nFemale Voice We\xe2\x80\x99re out\nLeonard: You know what? It\xe2\x80\x99s fine.\nFemale Voice: We can use the potpourri from the bathroom!\nPenny: Really, we\xe2\x80\x99re good.\nLeonard: Yup, just want to get married.\nPenny: Yeah.\nOfficial: Great. I\xe2\x80\x99ll see you two up there.\nLeonard: This is it.\nPenny: I know.\nLeonard: I love you.\nPenny: I love you, too.\nFemale Voice: Was that a yes or no on the potpourri?\nPenny: No, thank you.\nLeonard: We\xe2\x80\x99re good.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s House.\nSheldon: Raj, you\xe2\x80\x99re probably wondering why Amy and I aren\xe2\x80\x99t showing any affection to one another.\nRaj: Didn\xe2\x80\x99t even crack the top ten.\nSheldon: Well, you should know that she recently broke up with me.\nAmy: I said I needed time to think.\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you guys will figure something out.\nSheldon: You hear that? Raj is devastated.\nBernadette: Sheldon, shh. The wedding\xe2\x80\x99s starting.\nSheldon: I see what\xe2\x80\x99s happening. Sides are forming. Well, if Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s on Amy\xe2\x80\x99s team, I pick Howard.\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m not taking sides.\nSheldon: Fine, I guess I\xe2\x80\x99m stuck with Raj.\nRaj: Really?\nStuart: At least you got picked.\nScene: The Wedding Chapel.\nOfficial: Before I go any further, have either of you prepared your own vows?\nLeonard: Yes.\nPenny: No. You wrote vows?\nLeonard: Yeah.\nPenny: Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any. You\xe2\x80\x99re kind of making me look bad.\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s okay. I don\xe2\x80\x99t have to say them.\nPenny: No, no, no, go ahead. I\xe2\x80\x99ll come up with something mushy, you\xe2\x80\x99ll cry, we got this.\nLeonard: Penny, we are made of particles that have existed since the moment the universe began. I like to think those atoms travelled 14 billion years through time and space to create us, so that we could be together and make each other whole.\nPenny: Wow.\nOfficial: Penny?\nPenny: Right. Um, okay. Leonard, I mean, you\xe2\x80\x99re not only the love of my life. I mean, you\xe2\x80\x99re my best friend, and, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got a friend in me. You got troubles. I got \xe2\x80\x99em, too. There isn\xe2\x80\x99t anything I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do for you. We stick together, and we can see it through, \xe2\x80\x99cause you\xe2\x80\x99ve got a friend in me.\nOfficial: Is that the song from Toy Story?\nPenny: He loves that movie.\nLeonard: I do.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s house.\nBernadette: Aw, that was beautiful.\nHoward: Yeah. I mean, not like our wedding beautiful.\nBernadette: No, we totally won.\nSheldon: Amy, I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand, are we broken up or not? It\xe2\x80\x99s like you can\xe2\x80\x99t make up your mind.\nAmy: It\xe2\x80\x99s because you\xe2\x80\x99re not giving me any space to think.\nSheldon: Well, you should think fast, because men can sire offspring their entire lives, but those eggs you\xe2\x80\x99re toting around have a sell-by date.\nAmy: You know what, Sheldon, you\xe2\x80\x99ve made this really easy. You\xe2\x80\x99re immature, you\xe2\x80\x99re selfish, you just insulted me to my face. I don\xe2\x80\x99t need any more time to think. We\xe2\x80\x99re broken up.\nBernadette: Amy.\nSheldon: Will someone take me home?\nRaj: Yeah. Come on, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you a ride.\nOfficial (voice from computer) \xe2\x80\xa6symbolizes your eternal love. I now pronounce you husband and wife.\nPenny: We did it.\nLeonard: Yeah, I\xe2\x80\x99m so glad you guys could watch.\nHoward: We\xe2\x80\x99ll say it was beautiful in the comment section.\nScene: Hotel corridor.\nLeonard: No, no, no. Hang on. I believe I\xe2\x80\x99m supposed to carry you across the threshold.\nPenny: Can you?\nLeonard: Who do you think carries Sheldon to bed when he falls asleep in front of the TV?\nPenny: Okay, let\xe2\x80\x99s do it. You gonna make it?\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m okay.\nPenny: Nicely done.\nLeonard: Thank you. Finally, there\xe2\x80\x99s a Mrs. Hofstadter who isn\xe2\x80\x99t disappointed in me.\nPenny: Well, the night is still young.\nLeonard: Everything all right?\nPenny: Yeah. I guess.\nLeonard: Just tell me.\nPenny: It\xe2\x80\x99s just, when we were kissing, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help but picture you with that other girl.\nLeonard: Oh, no. No, come on. I have a friend in you. You said so.\nPenny: You\xe2\x80\x99re right. Just forget it.\nLeonard: Yeah. Okay, listen. If you\xe2\x80\x99re imagining that it was sexy, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t. We, we were both drunk, and she smelled like an ashtray. The boat was moving a lot, so I chipped her tooth.\nPenny: Did you feel guilty?\nLeonard: No, she had dental insurance.\nPenny: Did you feel guilty after kissing her?\nLeonard: Yes. I felt guilty as soon as it happened. I feel guilty every time I see her.\nPenny: What do you mean, every time you see her?\nLeonard: What do I mean? Boy, that\xe2\x80\x99s a toughie.\nPenny: You still see her?\nLeonard: Well, no, not socially. But, you know, just at work.\nPenny: You work with her? How could you not tell me that?\nLeonard: I wanted to tell you in the car, but you told me to stop talking\nPenny: Oh, okay. So you\xe2\x80\x99re saying this is my fault?\nLeonard: No, of course not. Okay, look, instead of fighting, why don\xe2\x80\x99t we dim the lights, um, get naked and make a baby? I was trying to lighten the mood. It\xe2\x80\x99s not easy. You try it.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon (on phone): Hello, Mother.\nMrs Cooper: Shelly! How\xe2\x80\x99s my baby doing?\nSheldon: I just wanted to let you know that you can remove Amy from your nightly prayers. Unless you\xe2\x80\x99re open to praying for a beehive to fall on her head.\nMrs Cooper: Oh, what\xe2\x80\x99s going on?\nSheldon: She broke up with me.\nMrs Cooper: Oh, Shelly.\nSheldon: No, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be okay. But I think that I\xe2\x80\x99d like to send the ring back to you.\nMrs Cooper: Well, let\xe2\x80\x99s not be hasty. Are you sure it\xe2\x80\x99s over for good?\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s over for me. I\xe2\x80\x99m done with women. Like when I swore off Pop Rocks. They both hurt you on purpose.\nMrs Cooper: You want to tell me what happened?\nSheldon: Are you going to say it\xe2\x80\x99s all part of God\xe2\x80\x99s plan?\nMrs Cooper: Good chance.\nSheldon: Then no, thank you.\nMrs Cooper: Well, honey, don\xe2\x80\x99t send it back yet. Your sister\xe2\x80\x99s married, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not letting your brother give my grandmother\xe2\x80\x99s ring to that whore he\xe2\x80\x99s dating.\nSheldon: Wasn\xe2\x80\x99t Mary Magdalene a woman of ill repute?\nMrs Cooper: When your idiot brother redeems mankind, he can date whoever he wants.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s house.\nBernadette: I know it hurts now, but it\xe2\x80\x99s gonna get better.\nAmy: Yeah.\nHoward: Everything\xe2\x80\x99s gonna be okay.\nStuart: You\xe2\x80\x99ve got so much to offer.\nAmy: Thank you.\nStuart: Any man would be lucky to have you.\nBernadette: That\xe2\x80\x99s true.\nAmy: I just hope I did the right thing.\nStuart: I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you did. Maybe that\xe2\x80\x99s the problem, you always do the right thing. Maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s time to do the wrong thing.\nAmy: Like you\xe2\x80\x99re doing right now?\nStuart: Exactly.\nScene: The stairwell.\nLeonard: I asked you over and over if you were okay. Why would you go through with the wedding if you weren\xe2\x80\x99t?\nPenny: I thought I was okay, but it turns out I\xe2\x80\x99m not.\nLeonard: Okay, listen, I may not have been entirely faithful, but you, you are not easy to lift.\nSheldon: Wow. Well, marriage must agree with you. Well, you are just glowing.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m not glowing. I\xe2\x80\x99m upset.\nSheldon: Well, whatever it is, it agrees with you.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nSheldon (outside): Knock, knock, knock, Penny? Knock, knock, knock, Penny? Knock, knock, knock, Penny?\nPenny: What\xe2\x80\x99s this?\nSheldon: Leonard told me what happened, so I took it upon myself to make you a hot beverage.\nPenny: Oh. That\xe2\x80\x99s so sweet of you.\nSheldon: Yeah. I know. Turns out, being sweet isn\xe2\x80\x99t enough to keep a girl these days. I blame Madonna.\nPenny: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry to hear about you and Amy.\nSheldon: Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry about Leonard. Thought I raised him better than that.\nPenny: You know, it\xe2\x80\x99s bad enough what happened, but then he tried to hide the fact that he sees her all the time at the university.\nSheldon: He does? Who is it?\nPenny: Some girl named Mandy.\nSheldon: Mandy Chao?\nPenny: Yeah.\nSheldon: Oh, you don\xe2\x80\x99t need to worry about her. She\xe2\x80\x99s brilliant and attractive. She can do way better\nthan Leonard.\nPenny: That\xe2\x80\x99s great.\nSheldon: Wait a minute. I know this may sound far fetched, but I\xe2\x80\x99m on the market now. You know, if I dated Mandy, that would teach both Leonard and Amy a lesson.\nPenny: That\xe2\x80\x99s ridiculous.\nSheldon: Oh, you\xe2\x80\x99re right. I could never be with a woman whose self-esteem was so low she\xe2\x80\x99d be with Leonard.\nPenny: I\xe2\x80\x99m with Leonard.\nSheldon: Yeah, I know. Forever. Who would have believed these things would happen to us?\nPenny: Right? I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe Amy actually went through with it.\nSheldon: Hang on. You knew that she was going to end it with me? Did you try and stop her?\nPenny: I told her to be true to herself and do what makes her happy.\nSheldon: Do what makes her happy? She plays the harp and her car is paid for. How much happier can she be?\nPenny: Okay, look, it\xe2\x80\x99s not my fault that she thought you were a bad boyfriend.\nSheldon: I see. Well, I think I\xe2\x80\x99ll be going.\nPenny: Sheldon.\nSheldon: No, no, no, no. We are done here. Would you mind opening the door and then angrily slamming it behind me?\nPenny: Sure.\nSheldon: Thank you. And slam it hard, because I am pretty steamed.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s house.\nHoward (on phone): All right, Leonard, hang in there. Talk to you tomorrow.\nBernadette: What happened? They just got married.\nHoward: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. It\xe2\x80\x99s a mess. They had a huge fight in Vegas.\nBernadette: Think they\xe2\x80\x99ll break up?\nHoward: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Sounds pretty bad. Penny\xe2\x80\x99s back in her apartment all by herself.\nStuart: Really?\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Would you like to hear another reason why men are better than women?\nLeonard: Sure, let\xe2\x80\x99s make it an even hundred.\nSheldon: You would never kiss me and make me say I love you and then break up with me.\nLeonard: I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t.\nSheldon: And you know why? \xe2\x80\x98Cause you\xe2\x80\x99re a man. The champagne of genders.\nLeonard: Well, I may be a man, but I think I\xe2\x80\x99m the one that screwed up on this one.\nSheldon: Yeah, well, and you admit it, like a man. All you hear women say is, I\xe2\x80\x99ll just have a salad. You know? Where\xe2\x80\x99s my lip gloss? I think this element should be called radium. That last one was Madame Curie.\nLeonard: I figured that out.\nSheldon: You know what? She was kind of an honorary man. She had a penis made of science.\nLeonard: Can\xe2\x80\x99t believe I\xe2\x80\x99m spending my wedding night with you.\nSheldon: Really? I never imagined it any other way.\n  Advertisements\nLoading...'
