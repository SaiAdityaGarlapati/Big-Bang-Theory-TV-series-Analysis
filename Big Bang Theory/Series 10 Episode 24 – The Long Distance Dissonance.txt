b'Following a \xe2\x80\x9cpreviously on\xe2\x80\x9d sequence.\nScene: Sheldon and Amy on skype.\nSheldon: How are you settling in?\nAmy: Pretty well. Princeton has a beautiful campus.\nSheldon: Now, I\xe2\x80\x99ve learned some fun facts about New Jersey to help you make small talk. Would you like to know the state bird or the murder rate? They\xe2\x80\x99re both shocking.\nAmy: Actually, I want to hear about you. How are things at home?\nSheldon: Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m a lot less likely to see an Eastern Goldfinch or be murdered, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you that.\nAmy: I miss you.\nSheldon: I miss you, too.\nAmy: It\xe2\x80\x99s so strange, earlier today I ended a sentence with a preposition and you weren\xe2\x80\x99t there to correct my grammar.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry you had to go through that.\nAmy: In fact, that\xe2\x80\x99s when I started to really miss you.\nSheldon: You know you just split an infinitive.\nAmy: Did I? Are you gonna teach me a lesson?\nSheldon: I am. It is naughty to put an adverb between the word to and the verb stem.\nAmy: What are you gonna do about it?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m going to admonish you.\nAmy: Vigorously?\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s the only kind of admonishing I do.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The cafeteria.\nHoward: How\xe2\x80\x99s Sheldon doing with Amy gone?\nLeonard: Well, the last three nights I\xe2\x80\x99ve had to take him to get a haircut, to the train store, and to a Walgreens in Arcadia where they still have the good ibuprofen. Now ask me how I\xe2\x80\x99m doing with Amy gone.\nRaj: How are you doing with\xe2\x80\xa6\nLeonard: Shut up.\nHoward: If you\xe2\x80\x99d like, we can help you out.\nLeonard: Oh, that would be great.\nHoward: I mean, not me, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a wife and child, but this one posts video of himself flossing on Instagram.\nRaj: It was a tutorial. And yes, I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to keep Sheldon company.\nLeonard: Great. Tonight he wants to look at ladders at Home Depot.\nRaj: Oh, why does he need a ladder?\nLeonard: He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t; he just likes looking at them. Bring a book.\nSheldon: Gentlemen. You may remember Dr. Nowitzki, She\xe2\x80\x99s back at Caltech for her postdoc.\nRamona Nowitzki: Hello.\nLeonard: Hello.\nRaj: Hi. Oh, let me bring a chair for you.\nSheldon: Oh, thanks. Dr. Nowitzki\xe2\x80\x99s going to tell me about the work she did at CERN. And she brought me this duty-free Toblerone.\nLeonard: Oh. I love those.\nSheldon: Let\xe2\x80\x99s sit somewhere else.\nRaj: What just happened?\nHoward: A stranger just lured Sheldon away with a candy bar.\nLeonard: Wait, isn\xe2\x80\x99t she the grad student that used to follow him around?\nHoward: Oh, yeah. Back before he hit puberty and grew man parts.\nRaj: So what do you guys think that\xe2\x80\x99s about?\nLeonard: Knowing Sheldon, nothing.\nSheldon: So, tell me about your scalar dark energy experiment.\nRamona: Not \xe2\x80\x99til you tell me about your latest paper on quantum loop theory.\nSheldon: Oh. You must be one of those dessert before dinner people.\nLeonard: He just made her laugh, something\xe2\x80\x99s wrong.\nRaj: Do you see the way she\xe2\x80\x99s looking at him?\nHoward: Yeah. Like Bernadette used to look at me.\nRaj: I keep telling you, close the bathroom door.\nLeonard: Ah, did you see that? She just touched his hand and he didn\xe2\x80\x99t swat it away. What is happening?\nHoward: Okay, the simplest explanation is usually the right one.\nRaj: Which is?\nHoward: That ain\xe2\x80\x99t Sheldon.\nScene: The apartment.\nPenny: Not only did they eat together, Leonard said he made her laugh.\nBernadette: That\xe2\x80\x99s nothing, Howie said she touched his hand.\nPenny: Did he Purell?\nBernadette: No.\nPenny: I cannot believe Leonard mentioned the Toblerone but left that part out.\nBernadette: Should we call Amy?\nPenny: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know; we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t worry her if it\xe2\x80\x99s nothing.\nBernadette: I guess we could wait till we have more information about this girl.\nPenny: Yeah. Do you think living with Amy has somehow stirred up Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s sexual appetite?\nBernadette: Ugh. How can you think that? Why would you even put those words together?\nPenny: All right, then we agree. He\xe2\x80\x99s not making any moves, it\xe2\x80\x99s this Dr. Ramona chick.\nBernadette: Nowitzki. I googled her, she\xe2\x80\x99s pretty cute.\nPenny: Really? All I got from Leonard was the Toblerone bar had nuts.\nScene: Sheldon and Amy on skype.\nSheldon: And get this, I saw an articulating ladder with dual-leg leveling, which delivers stability and adaptability to uneven terrain.\nAmy: Sounds like a big night.\nSheldon: Yeah. Raj made the funniest joke, he said, which is the best ladder to use to hang myself?\nAmy: So you\xe2\x80\x99re keeping busy? You\xe2\x80\x99re not lonely?\nSheldon: Oh, not at all. I\xe2\x80\x99ve had outings with Leonard and Raj in the evening, and, oh, I had lunch\nwith Dr. Nowitzki.\nAmy: Who\xe2\x80\x99s he?\nSheldon: Oh, Dr. Nowitzki is a woman.\nAmy: Oh. Really? Uh, when did you meet her?\nSheldon: Many years ago. Back when she was a grad student. She\xe2\x80\x99s always been a huge fan of my work, and now she\xe2\x80\x99s doing research at Caltech.\nAmy: Huge fan, you say?\nSheldon: Yes. I think you\xe2\x80\x99d like her. She\xe2\x80\x99s extremely intelligent, just like you. Unlike you, she\xe2\x80\x99s tall, blonde and used to be an Olympic swimmer.\nAmy: That\xe2\x80\x99s terrific. I\xe2\x80\x99ll call you right back.\nScene: The apartment.\nPenny (answering skype): Oh, hey, Amy.\nAmy: I gave you one job. Keep an eye on him. How hard is that?\nPenny: We thought you meant not letting him run out into traffic.\nBernadette: Which he only did once.\nAmy: Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you tell me?\nBernadette: We didn\xe2\x80\x99t want you to worry.\nAmy: Should I worry?\nPenny: No. Come on, it\xe2\x80\x99s Sheldon. Nothing is gonna happen.\nAmy: That\xe2\x80\x99s what you said to me when I started dating him. And then five years later, bingo bango, something happened.\nBernadette: Yeah, but you\xe2\x80\x99re gonna be back in three months.\nAmy: You don\xe2\x80\x99t get it. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been smacking that ketchup bottle for a long time. All she\xe2\x80\x99s got to do is tip it over and point it at her fries.\nPenny: Well, what do you want us to do?\nAmy: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Might be the New Jersey talking, but this Nowitzki broad needs to disappear.\nBernadette: That\xe2\x80\x99s ridiculous. As far as we know, all that happened is two scientists had lunch.\nAmy: Yeah, but one of those scientists is a tall, blonde Olympic swimmer.\nPenny: Come on. Looks don\xe2\x80\x99t matter to Sheldon. Because he only has eyes for you.\nAmy: Nice try.\nPenny: Thanks. I was scrambling.\nScene: The comic book store.\nHoward: It\xe2\x80\x99s unbelievable. Sheldon has lunch with another woman and somehow my wife yells at me.\nLeonard: Penny laid into me, too. Apparently, I\xe2\x80\x99m overly fixated on premium Swiss chocolate bars.\nRaj: Can you even eat those things?\nLeonard: If I take a Lactaid a half-hour before and some Pepto right after.\nRaj: Sounds like a lot of work.\nLeonard: Eh, I\xe2\x80\x99m worth it.\nHoward: Guys. Focus. Should we do something about Nowitzki?\nLeonard: Like what?\nRaj: Uh, well, she\xe2\x80\x99s single, so if somebody else asks her out and she says yes, then we know she\xe2\x80\x99s not into Sheldon.\nStuart: I\xe2\x80\x99ll do it.\nLeonard: No offence, Stuart, but the woman\xe2\x80\x99s a doctor.\nStuart: So? Doctors like me. Whenever I see mine he calls in a bunch of other doctors to have a look.\nHoward: She\xe2\x80\x99s not that kind of doctor.\nStuart: Oh. Well, her loss. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been called a genuine medical oddity.\nRaj: Actually, I was going to suggest me.\nHoward: Great. Anybody\xe2\x80\x99s better than, mmm.\nStuart: Excuse me. They took out my spleen and gallbladder, not my feelings.\nScene: The cafeteria.\nRaj: Dr. Nowitzki. Good to see you.\nRamona: Good to see you, too.\nRaj: May I join you?\nRamona: No.\nRaj: Good to see you.\nHoward: We should call Guinness, that might be a record.\nRaj: She\xe2\x80\x99s clearly having a working lunch and preferred to eat alone.\nRamona: Dr. Cooper, over here.\nRaj: I could have made her very happy.\nLeonard: You kept walking. I think you did.\nScene: The apartment.\nPenny: Do you really think there\xe2\x80\x99s reason to worry?\nLeonard: Yeah, she\xe2\x80\x99s definitely going after Sheldon.\nRaj: I made a play for her and she shot me down.\nPenny: All right, well, that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t prove anything.\nBernadette: Yeah, there\xe2\x80\x99s a million reasons a woman would shoot Raj down.\nRaj: Like, really, a million?\nBernadette: Fine, hundreds.\nRaj: Thank you.\nPenny: The point is this could be nothing and we are all overreacting.\nSheldon: Hey, everybody. This is my friend, Dr. Nowitzki.\nRamona: Hi.\nAll; Hi.\nSheldon: We just went swimming.\nScene: The same, later.\nLeonard: And you actually got in a pool?\nSheldon: I was scared, but I told myself it\xe2\x80\x99s just a big bathtub. Then I got scared again \xe2\x80\x99cause there are all these strangers in my bathtub.\nRamona: I was proud of him, a lot of people don\xe2\x80\x99t put their face in the water on the first day.\nSheldon: Well, I was hiding from a bee, but it still counts.\nBernadette: Can I just squeeze in here?\nPenny: So, Sheldon, have you talked to Amy?\nSheldon: Yes, we skyped this morning and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure I\xe2\x80\x99ll check in with her before I go to sleep.\nRamona: Sheldon talks about her all the time. I can\xe2\x80\x99t wait to meet her.\nSheldon: That is true. She keeps asking how long Amy\xe2\x80\x99s going to be gone.\nLeonard: Uh, so, Ramona, tell us about yourself. Do you, do you have a boyfriend?\nSheldon: Leonard, your wife is sitting right here. What are you doing?\nRamona: No, my work doesn\xe2\x80\x99t leave me a lot of time for relationships.\nRaj: I think you made that very clear.\nSheldon: She was part of the American team at CERN.\nRamona: I had a front row seat when they detected the Higgs boson.\nSheldon: Do you know, I\xe2\x80\x99ve corresponded with Peter Higgs. Would you like to see some of his letters?\nRamona: Absolutely.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99ll get them.\nRamona: Well, hang on, I\xe2\x80\x99ll come with you.\nSheldon: Oh, fun. Like a play date.\nPenny: Okay, correct me if I\xe2\x80\x99m wrong, but isn\xe2\x80\x99t that exactly what we were supposed to stop from happening?\nBernadette: I threw my body at them, what else did you want me to do?\nLeonard: You think you should call Amy?\nPenny: You got fingers and a mouth, you call her.\nScene: Sheldon and Amy\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nSheldon: Here you go.\nRamona: Are these all from Peter Higgs?\nSheldon: Hmm? Oh, no, no, no. They\xe2\x80\x99re from many famous people. See? Oh, like this one. This is from Patrick Stewart. It says if I come to his house again, I get to meet his dogs. Oh, excuse me.\nAmy: Hello, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Oh, hello, Amy.\nAmy: I was missing you again.\nSheldon: I miss you, too. Hey, this is good timing. Remember that Dr. Nowitzki I told you about? She\xe2\x80\x99s right here.\nAmy: She\xe2\x80\x99s what?\nRamona: Hello.\nAmy: Hi.\nRamona: So nice to meet you.\nAmy: Uh-huh. Hang on. (answering phone) Hello. A little late, Leonard. Sorry.\nSheldon: What is Leonard doing calling you at this hour?\nAmy: It\xe2\x80\x99s not important.\nSheldon: I must tell you, that seems a little inappropriate. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you agree?\nRamona: I do.\nSheldon: See? We both think so.\nScene: The apartment.\nPenny: All right, this is making me crazy. Somebody\xe2\x80\x99s got to go over there.\nLeonard: You got feet and legs, you do it.\nPenny: Will you go with me?\nBernadette: To do what? Shake a can of nickels at them?\nRaj: We\xe2\x80\x99re being ridiculous. There\xe2\x80\x99s no way a woman that attractive is trying to seduce Sheldon Cooper.\nHoward: You done trying to make yourself feel better?\nRaj: No. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t played the race card yet.\nSheldon: Hey, I hate to break up the party, but Amy says I\xe2\x80\x99m tired and have to go to bed.\nRamona: It was nice seeing everybody. Thank you for dinner.\nPenny: Sure.\nLeonard: Our pleasure.\nRaj: Whatever.\nRamona: Walk me to my car?\nSheldon: Of course.\nPenny: We\xe2\x80\x99ll all go.\nBernadette: Excuse me.\nPenny: Pardon. I just need to., yeah.\nSheldon: That was fun. It was like Mario Kart.\nScene: The street.\nSheldon: Bye.\nPenny: We need to talk.\nSheldon: What? Is this about Leonard and Amy? I don\xe2\x80\x99t like it either.\nScene: Sheldon and Amy\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nPenny: Okay, I know you don\xe2\x80\x99t have a lot of experience with women, but Ramona seems to have a romantic interest in you.\nSheldon: That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make any sense. She knows I have a girlfriend.\nPenny: Well, sometimes women don\xe2\x80\x99t care. Sometimes it makes them want a guy even more.\nSheldon: That may be true, but Dr. Nowitzki\xe2\x80\x99s just a friend. In fact, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have even noticed she\xe2\x80\x99s a woman if she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t worn that bathing suit that highlighted her bosom.\nPenny: Okay. Um, let\xe2\x80\x99s try this. Think of yourself as one of those limited edition toys people like to collect.\nSheldon: I already do.\nPenny: Well, then you get it.\nSheldon: Because there\xe2\x80\x99s only one of me, I\xe2\x80\x99m more valuable.\nPenny: Right.\nSheldon: Although, Amy\xe2\x80\x99s already taken me out of my package and played with me.\nPenny: Let\xe2\x80\x99s forget the toy thing, okay? Um, maybe\xe2\x80\xa6\nSheldon: Penny, look. I appreciate your concern, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x99s happening.\nPenny: All right. What do you think is happening?\nSheldon: I think Dr. Nowitzki is a friendly colleague. I think you and Leonard need to see a marriage counsellor. And I need to update my r\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9 to include swimming as a special skill.\nPenny: Don\xe2\x80\x99t look at me like that, I tried.\nScene: Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s office.\nRamona: Hey, did you eat yet?\nSheldon: Uh, breakfast yes, lunch no. I did have a cough drop, but that really rides the line between sucking and eating.\nRamona: Well, perfect. I made us sandwiches.\nSheldon: How thoughtful. Thank you.\nRamona: Mmm. No big deal, I enjoy spending time with you.\nSheldon: And I with you. Question, are you seeking a romantic relationship with me?\nRamona: What if I were?\nSheldon: Well, that would raise a number of problems. We\xe2\x80\x99re colleagues. I\xe2\x80\x99m currently in a relation\xe2\x80\xa6 Excuse me a moment.\nScene: Princeton.\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. Will you marry me?\nAdvertisements'
