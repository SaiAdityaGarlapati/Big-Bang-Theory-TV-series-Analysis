b'Scene: The university cafeteria.\nHoward: Gagh!\nLeonard: Problem?\nHoward: This is the worst cobbler I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever eaten. I mean it tastes like it was made of actual ground-up shoemaker.\nSheldon: Amusing. A play on the two meanings of cobbler.\nRaj: Hey guys, guess who I found at LAX. My baby sister Priya.\nSheldon: Excuse me. I object. You propose a guessing game, yet you don\xe2\x80\x99t give me enough time to guess. For the record, I was going to say your sister Priya.\nPriya: Oh, Sheldon. You haven\xe2\x80\x99t changed a bit, have you?\nSheldon: Why would I change?\nLeonard: The hope has been that you\xe2\x80\x99d eventually bend to public opinion. So, Priya, what brings you back to LA?\nPriya: I have a one day layover on my way to Toronto. Corporate merger.\nRaj: Can you believe it? Little Priya\xe2\x80\x99s one of the lead attorneys for the biggest car company in India.\nSheldon: Given that when we met her she was finishing law school and planning an internship at a large Indian car company, it\xe2\x80\x99s actually extremely plausible.\nLeonard: And your poll numbers just keep dropping.\nPriya: I want to catch up with all of you, but first I really must visit the loo.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m going too, I\xe2\x80\x99ll show you where it is.\nRaj: Alright, this goes without saying, but I\xe2\x80\x99m just going to say it anyway. Hands off my sister.\nSheldon: Why would I touch her, she\xe2\x80\x99s covered with airplane germs.\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99m so not talking to you. I\xe2\x80\x99m talking to him.\nHoward: Hey, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a girlfriend now.\nRaj: Oh please. My sister\xe2\x80\x99s much hotter than your girlfriend and you know it.\nHoward: Let\xe2\x80\x99s just agree they\xe2\x80\x99re both hot.\nRaj: Dude, that\xe2\x80\x99s my sister you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about.\nHoward: Okay, forget who\xe2\x80\x99s hotter. The first time Priya came to LA, Leonard and I made a pact out of respect to our friendship, and to you, that neither of us would hit on her.\nRaj: Did you pinky swear?\nHoward: Yes.\nRaj: Okay then.\nSheldon: Cobbler. I\xe2\x80\x99m still laughing.\nScene: A corridor.\n  Priya: It\xe2\x80\x99s really nice to see you again Leonard.\nLeonard: Yeah. It\xe2\x80\x99s good to see you too. Here you go.\nPriya: Thanks. (Grabs him and kisses him.)\nLeonard: Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa. (Looks around.) Okay.\nCredits sequence.\n  Scene: The cafeteria.\n  Howard: So, you got any special plans with your sister?\nRaj: Oh, not really, just hang out.\nSheldon: I always tell people, if you have only one day in Los Angeles, make it a train day.\nRaj: Train day?\nSheldon: The fun starts with brunch at Carney\xe2\x80\x99s in Studio City, a hot dog stand in a converted railroad dining car. Next stop, Travel Town, an outdoor museum featuring 43 railroad engines, cars and other rolling stock from the 1880s to the 1930s. Finally, we\xe2\x80\x99re off to the glitz and glamour of Hollywood for dinner at, that\xe2\x80\x99s right, the Hollywood Carney\xe2\x80\x99s, a hot dog stand in a different converted railroad dining car.\nRaj: I don\xe2\x80\x99t think we\xe2\x80\x99re going to do that.\nSheldon: Well then apparently, you hate fun.\nLeonard: Hmm, Priya\xe2\x80\x99s not back yet? Well, I guess that\xe2\x80\x99s not unusual, women, men, the whole sitting, standing deal, so, what are we talking about?\nRaj: Uh, my plans with Priya.\nSheldon: He rejected train day.\nLeonard: Did you make it clear that it\xe2\x80\x99s two different train cars turned into hot dog stands?\nSheldon: Abundantly.\nLeonard: I guess he just hates fun.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s what I said.\nPriya: Okay, so, what\xe2\x80\x99s new with you guys.\nHoward: I have a girlfriend now.\nPriya: Hey, good for you.\nHoward: Yeah, I just wanna put it out there in case I inadvertently squirt any pheromones in your direction. Happy? (Raj nods).\n  Leonard: So, uh, Priya, what are your plans while you\xe2\x80\x99re here.\nPriya: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, I just have the one day.\nSheldon: Do you like trains?\nPriya: Not particularly.\nSheldon: You might as well just wait at the airport for your flight.\nScene: The apartment. Sheldon is on his laptop.\n  Sheldon: You are in a forest. There is quicksand to the west, a path leads to the east. Go east. An iron gate blocks your way. Open gate. It\xe2\x80\x99s locked. Hmm, well, so much for that.\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s getting pretty late, how come you\xe2\x80\x99re still up?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99ve found an emulator online that lets you play classic text based computer games from the 1980s.\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99s pretty cool.\nSheldon: Oh yes. It runs on the world\xe2\x80\x99s most powerful graphics chip, imagination.\nLeonard: You\xe2\x80\x99ve really got to get out more.\nSheldon: Go north. You can\xe2\x80\x99t go that way. Go west. A troll blocks your passage. Okay, fasten your seatbelts, kill troll. With what? With sword. (There is a knock on the door.) You don\xe2\x80\x99t have the sword. Good golly, it\xe2\x80\x99s as if it\xe2\x80\x99s actually happening to me.\nPriya (at door): Raj finally went to bed.\nLeonard: Yeah, well, (kissing her) Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s still up.\nPriya: You said he goes to bed at nine.\nLeonard: Yeah, he does but he got caught up in a computer game and\xe2\x80\xa6\nSheldon: Hit troll with axe. Hit troll with axe. Hit troll with axe. Oh my, this is one tough troll.\nPriya: Can\xe2\x80\x99t you get rid of him?\nLeonard: If the past is any indication, no.\nSheldon: Leonard, I\xe2\x80\x99m trapped in quicksand, the axe is dragging me down.\nLeonard: Drop axe.\nSheldon: Drop axe. Brilliant.\nLeonard: Give me a minute. Sheldon,\nSheldon: Hold on. I have to figure out how to get the bucket, so I can carry the mud past the dragon.\nLeonard: Sheldon, you need to work in the morning.\nSheldon: I know.\nLeonard: Well then, bed mister.\nSheldon: Five more minutes.\nLeonard: Really? You\xe2\x80\x99re going to risk getting sleepy in the middle of your thermodynamic fluctuations seminar? You know what happens when you yawn in public.\nSheldon: Everyone will see my oddly shaped uvula.\nLeonard: You don\xe2\x80\x99t want that, do you?\nSheldon: No. But it\xe2\x80\x99s a shame our society mocks the differently uvulated. Who was at the door?\nLeonard: Oh, uh, building manager. They have to fix a pipe so the water will be off tomorrow from noon to two.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s unacceptable. We\xe2\x80\x99re supposed to be given written notice.\nLeonard: No, no, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter, we\xe2\x80\x99ll be at work.\nSheldon: Well, what if I spill tomato soup on my shirt and have to come home to change, only to find there\xe2\x80\x99s no water for an enzyme soak.\nLeonard: Bifurcated uvula, Sheldon!\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99ll have the chicken noodle. Goodnight.\nLeonard (to Priya): We\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to be very quiet.\nSheldon: I know how to get the bucket! I can turn the axe around and use the handle to reach it. Let\xe2\x80\x99s see. Go north. You are in a forest. Go north. You are in a forest. Go north. You are in a forest. Oh dear, I believe I\xe2\x80\x99m lost. Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll just have to get a fresh start tomorrow.\nLeonard: No, no, no, no, no. You just need, you just need, you just need to map it out. Come on, I\xe2\x80\x99ll help you. So, uh, you stopped at the stream and you turned north three times?\nSheldon: Yes.\nLeonard: You\xe2\x80\x99re right, you\xe2\x80\x99re lost, good luck.\nScene: Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom. Morning.\n  Priya: Oh! Leonard, wake up.\nLeonard: Huh! Sorry!\nPriya: For what?\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. When I\xe2\x80\x99m in bed with a girl, it\xe2\x80\x99s just, it\xe2\x80\x99s my go to response.\nPriya: It\xe2\x80\x99s six o\xe2\x80\x99 clock, I have to get back to Raj\xe2\x80\x99s before he wakes up and realises I\xe2\x80\x99m gone.\nLeonard: Oh, right, sure. I wish you could stay in LA a while longer.\nPriya: Mmm. Me too.\nLeonard: You know, I was thinking, there are some great research facilities in India.\nPriya: Where are you going with this, Leonard?\nLeonard: Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m just saying, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any real ties here, so if I were to move to New Delhi we could, you know, go out.\nPriya: Leonard, didn\xe2\x80\x99t we have this conversation five years ago.\nLeonard: Well, yes, but, things have changed, you know, you\xe2\x80\x99re older, I\xe2\x80\x99m older. Look, no more superhero bedsheets.\nPriya: Sweetheart, just because we have fun when I come to town doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean I want to have a serious relationship.\nLeonard: It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t?\nPriya: Mm-mm. And besides, I could never bring a white boy home to my parents. They\xe2\x80\x99d have a cow. Which is a much bigger deal in India.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m not that white. My great-great grandmother was half Cherokee. I know that\xe2\x80\x99s not the right kind of Indian but it is something.\nPriya: Aha, you\xe2\x80\x99re funny.\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard. (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard. (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard.\nLeonard: What?\nSheldon: I heard a woman laughing.\nLeonard: Oh, uh, yeah, I was trying to see if I could laugh as a woman.\nSheldon: Oh. Well, good job, quite convincing. I smell perfume.\nLeonard: Air freshener.\nSheldon: And is that lipstick on your cheek and neck.\nLeonard: Uh, rash, that\xe2\x80\x99s a bad rash.\nSheldon: My sympathies. I am no stranger to the crimson scourge that is dermatitis. Can I interest you in a topical steroid from my lotion and unguent collection?\nLeonard: Uh, yeah, yeah, that sounds great.\nSheldon: Very well, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure I can find something that will help you ditch that itch.\nLeonard: Okay, he\xe2\x80\x99s in the bathroom, let\xe2\x80\x99s go.\nSheldon: Do you prefer ointment or cream?\nLeonard: Uh, cream.\nSheldon: With or without a numbing agent?\nLeonard: Without.\nSheldon: Really? Leonard, there are no heroes when it comes to dermatitis.\nLeonard: Fine. With.\nSheldon: Prescription or non-prescription strength.\nLeonard: Use your best judgement.\nSheldon: Well, I think I have a nice 2009 AnaMantle HC. It\xe2\x80\x99s usually indicated for acutely inflamed haemorrhoids, but it also goes nicely with non mucosal body parts.\nLeonard: Sounds great.\nSheldon: Excellent choice.\nLeonard (whispering): Right, right, alright. (They creep almost to the apartment door.)\n  Sheldon: Priya?\nPriya: Good morning, Sheldon.\nSheldon: For shame, Leonard. For shame. And to think I was ready to waste the last of my good haemorrhoid cream on you.\nScene: Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s car.\n  Leonard: Making pretty good time, huh?\nSheldon: Is that really what you want to talk about, Leonard?\nLeonard: No.\nSheldon: What do you want to talk about?\nLeonard: Please don\xe2\x80\x99t tell anyone I spent the night with Raj\xe2\x80\x99s sister.\nSheldon: There it is. What if someone asks?\nLeonard: No-one\xe2\x80\x99s going to ask if I spent the night with Raj\xe2\x80\x99s sister.\nSheldon: Perhaps. But they might ask me something else.\nLeonard: Like what?\nSheldon: Like, has Leonard betrayed any of his friends recently?\nLeonard: Priya and I are both adults. We didn\xe2\x80\x99t betray Raj.\nSheldon: In fact, you did, but I was referring to Howard.\nLeonard: What are you talking about?\nSheldon: April 12th, 2005, Bob\xe2\x80\x99s Big Boy, Toluca Lake. Raj had just introduced us to Priya for the first time, and she was enjoying the sweet taste of Hindu rebellion in the form of a Bob\xe2\x80\x99s Super Big Boy hamburger. In order to preserve your friendship, you and Howard made a pinky swear that neither of you would attempt to woo her. I had a patty melt.\nLeonard: Okay, fine, I betrayed Howard.\nSheldon: And Raj.\nLeonard: Alright, and Raj.\nSheldon: And me.\nLeonard: You?\nSheldon: Violation of the roommate agreement, overnight guest notification clause.\nLeonard: Okay fine, I\xe2\x80\x99m, I\xe2\x80\x99m a horrible human being, I\xe2\x80\x99m the Darth Vader of Pasadena.\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re far too short to be Darth Vader. At best you might be a turncoat Ewok.\nLeonard: My point is, Priya\xe2\x80\x99s gone. And it would be much better if no-one else found out about this.\nSheldon: You mean, you want me to keep a secret.\nLeonard: Yes.\nSheldon: You know I can\xe2\x80\x99t keep a secret.\nLeonard: You can if you try. Think about it this way, if I were Batman and you were Alfred, you\xe2\x80\x99d keep that secret. Right?\nSheldon: Why do you get to be Batman?\nLeonard: Because, well, Batman has the secret.\nSheldon: Well Alfred has secrets too.\nLeonard: Like what?\nSheldon: Alfred knows that Barbara Gordon is Batgirl. Which I\xe2\x80\x99ve now just told to Batman. See, I can\xe2\x80\x99t keep a secret.\nScene: Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s lab.\n  Sheldon: Ta-da!\nLeonard: What.\nSheldon: Ta-da. It\xe2\x80\x99s short for da-da-da-da!\nLeonard: Kind of busy here, Sheldon.\nSheldon: I know, that\xe2\x80\x99s why I shortened it.\nLeonard: What do you want.\nSheldon: I came to go over your alibi for last night.\nLeonard: What alibi?\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99ve asked me to lie on your behalf, and as you know, I am deeply uncomfortable with impromptu dishonest, so I\xe2\x80\x99ve provided you with an iron clad alibi. You couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have spent last night with Priya, because you were with another woman.\nLeonard: Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m so sure I\xe2\x80\x99m going to regret this, but, who was I with?\nSheldon: The fun loving, and morally loose, Miss Maggie McGeary.\nLeonard: Oh, God.\nSheldon: You met her at Pasadena\xe2\x80\x99s most popular Irish watering hole, Lucky Baldwin\xe2\x80\x99s, where Maggie spends her nights tending bar, with a head full of curls and a heart full of dreams.\nLeonard (reading a napkin Sheldon has handed him): Leonard, call me if you\xe2\x80\x99re interested in coitus. Sincerely, Maggie McGeary.\nSheldon: And if anyone were to actually call that number they will hear this.\nMechanical voice on Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s phone: Top of the morning to you. You\xe2\x80\x99ve reached Maggie McGeary. Leave a message after the wee little beep.\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s pretty convincing, huh? And it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t even a real person. And here is the clincher. A lock of Maggie\xe2\x80\x99s flaming auburn hair.\nLeonard: Where did you get that?\nSheldon: From an orang-u-tan in the primate lab.\nLeonard: An orang-u-tan?\nSheldon: Well, no-one\xe2\x80\x99s going to run a DNA test on it, Leonard, honestly you over-think everything.\nLeonard: Sheldon, I don\xe2\x80\x99t need an alibi. Nobody\xe2\x80\x99s going to ask about last night as long as you just zip your lip. (Sheldon makes lip zipping movement.) Thankyou. Now don\xe2\x80\x99t worry, everything is going to be fine. (Sheldon writes \xe2\x80\x9cI doubt it\xe2\x80\x9d on Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s whiteboard.\n  Scene: The cafeteria.\n  Leonard: Hey.\nRaj: Hey, Leonard, will you please tell Howard my sister\xe2\x80\x99s never been attracted to him.\nLeonard: C\xe2\x80\x99mon Raj, how am I supposed to know who she\xe2\x80\x99s attracted to. Or was attracted to. Or who she might be attracted to. In the future.\nSheldon: And I have nothing to contribute to this conversation. Because I too know absolutely nothing about Priya\xe2\x80\x99s preferences in male companionship. And with that, I will re-zip my lip.\nRaj: Hey, so what did you guys think of the new episode of Caprica last night?\nLeonard: I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see it.\nHoward: Didn\xe2\x80\x99t see it? What were you doing?\nLeonard: Uh, I was out.\nRaj: On Caprica night?\nLeonard: Yeah, I, uh, went for a drink.\nHoward: Really, you, and where, where did you go?\nLeonard: To, uh, Lucky Baldwin\xe2\x80\x99s.\nSheldon: Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard of that place, isn\xe2\x80\x99t that Pasadena\xe2\x80\x99s favourite Irish watering hole.\nLeonard: Yes.\nSheldon: Did you meet anyone interesting there, perhaps a promiscuous redheaded barmaid?\nLeonard: As a matter of fact I.. I\xe2\x80\xa6 I can\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\xa6 I can\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\xa6 I can\xe2\x80\x99t do it.\nSheldon: Sure you can, you\xe2\x80\x99re doing fine, it\xe2\x80\x99s very believable.\nLeonard: Look, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry Raj, but the truth is I was with Priya last night.\nSheldon: Don\xe2\x80\x99t listen to him, he\xe2\x80\x99s still light headed from all the Irish whiskey and pickled eggs in his system.\nRaj: What were you doing with Priya?\nSheldon: I believe they engaged in coitus but, more importantly, if Leonard had not abandoned his story, would you have found it plausible?\nRaj: What? You slept with my sister?\nLeonard: Yeah.\nHoward: How could you? We had a pact!\nRaj: Excuse me, I think how could you she\xe2\x80\x99s my sister takes precedence over a five year old pinky swear!\nSheldon: May I point out, in a parallel universe, your friends are saying Maggie McGeary, she sounds lovely.\nLeonard: Look, I admit it, I may have crossed a line here, but come on, Raj, your sister is a grown woman. To her, I\xe2\x80\x99m a forbidden piece of white chocolate.\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\xa6 I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe it, this is a terrible betrayal of my trust.\nLeonard: No, no, no, would it help if I told you that I offered her my heart and she kind of stomped on it.\nRaj: How hard did she stomp?\nLeonard: Very hard.\nRaj: Okay, I\xe2\x80\x99m good.\nHoward: Yeah, well, Raj, I just want to say that I\xe2\x80\x99d never betray your trust. Unlike Leonard, I respect you.\nLeonard: Really?\nHoward: Mmm.\nLeonard: Was it out of respect that you didn\xe2\x80\x99t tell Raj about the time you dropped his iPhone in a urinal?\nRaj: Dude! I put that thing on my face!\nSheldon: I think a more amusing violation of Raj\xe2\x80\x99s trust is when Howard convinced him that foreigners give presents to Americans on Thanksgiving.\nHoward: Hey, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see you giving back your Snoopy snowcone maker.\nRaj: That was all a lie? This year\xe2\x80\x99s gifts are already wrapped!\nHoward: And as long as we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about betraying our friends, how about the month Sheldon spent grinding up insects and mixing them into Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s food.\nSheldon: Well, excuse me. That was not a betrayal, that was an experiment to determine at what concentration food starts tasting mothy.\nLeonard: You put moths in my food?\nSheldon: For science.\nRaj: I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe you kissed my sister with moth mouth.\nLeonard: Well, uh, I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe you used Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s toothbrush.\nSheldon: You used my toothbrush?\nRaj: Not the brush part, just the little rubber thing to pick food from my teeth and massage my gums.\nLeonard: Okay, I, I, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s safe to say that we\xe2\x80\x99ve all done some things we\xe2\x80\x99re not particularly proud of. But come on, we\xe2\x80\x99re friends. Friends overlook each other\xe2\x80\x99s minor lapses. For the record, Howard, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry that I broke our pact.\nHoward: Thankyou, and I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry about your phone. And Thanksgiving. And while we\xe2\x80\x99re at it, you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to wash our clothes on the fourth of July.\nRaj: As long as we\xe2\x80\x99re apologising, Sheldon, I, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry I used your toothbrush.\nSheldon: And I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. But that behaviour is beyond the pale and cannot be tolerated. We are no longer friends.\nRaj: I got you a talking Thomas the Tank Engine for Thanksgiving.\nSheldon: With real puffing smoke?\nRaj: Yes.\nSheldon: Alright. But I\xe2\x80\x99m watching you.\nScene: The apartment. Sheldon is making snowcones.\n  Leonard: Hey, you got Snoopy out. Can I have a snowcone?\nSheldon: Well, sure.\nLeonard: These are pretty god, what flavour is this?\nSheldon: Guess.\nLeonard: Papaya?\nSheldon: No.\nLeonard: Guava?\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re so close.\nLeonard: I give up.\nSheldon: Mango, caterpillar. What are you doing? You said you liked it!\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
