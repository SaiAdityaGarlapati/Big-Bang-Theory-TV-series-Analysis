b'Scene: The apartment.\nPenny: Wow, Sheldon, I cannot believe you made up your own game.\nSheldon: Oh, Research Lab is more than a game. It\xe2\x80\x99s like the slogan says, the physics is theoretical, but the fun is real.\nLeonard: We must not be playing it right.\nPenny: All right, five. One, two, three, four, five. Oh, wow, look at that, my Department of Defence research grant is renewed.\nSheldon: Oh! Great roll! Now you can demolish your Soviet-style cyclotron and build the large Hadron Collider.\nPenny: Yay.\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re a natural at this, Penny. And as the first beta testers, you two\xe2\x80\x99ll have quite the edge when we play with Wolowitz and Koothrappali on Sunday.\nLeonard: Oh, gee, Sheldon, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think we can play on Sunday.\nSheldon: Why not?\nLeonard: Because of the reasons that Penny will now tell you. Penny?\nPenny: Actually, I have to pick up my friend Justin from the airport.\nLeonard: There you go, she has to pick up her friend Justin at the airport, aAnd I can\xe2\x80\x99t play \xe2\x80\x99cause I\xe2\x80\x99m going with her, right?\nPenny: Um, yeah, if you want. I mean, there may not be room. He\xe2\x80\x99s got a lot of stuff, like guitars and amplifiers.\nLeonard: Wait. What are you talking about?\nPenny: My friend, Justin.\nSheldon: Pay attention, Leonard. That\xe2\x80\x99s why she can\xe2\x80\x99t play on Sunday.\nLeonard: Who is this Justin?\nSheldon: Your turn, Leonard.\nPenny: I told you about him.\nLeonard: No, you didn\xe2\x80\x99t.\nSheldon: Roll the dice, Leonard.\nPenny: Yeah, my friend from Omaha, plays the guitar. Anyway, he\xe2\x80\x99s coming to L.A. looking for some session work, so I told him he could just crash on my couch for a few weeks.\nSheldon: Come on, Leonard, if you roll a six, Penny dies horribly in a nuclear meltdown. See what I mean when I say the fun is real?\nLeonard: Hang on. Some guy is going to be sleeping on your couch?\nPenny: He\xe2\x80\x99s not some guy. He\xe2\x80\x99s my friend.\nLeonard: So by friend, do you mean friend friend, gay friend, or ex boyfriend who you\xe2\x80\x99re now platonic with but still might have a thing for you friend\xe2\x80\x9d?\nPenny: Well, he\xe2\x80\x99s definitely not gay.\nLeonard: Oh, a definitely not gay musician sleeping on my girlfriend\xe2\x80\x99s couch. Yippee.\nPenny: Okay, we went out a little bit, a long time ago, but we were never like going out.\nLeonard: Okay, not to be pedantic, but the last I checked went out was in fact the past tense of going out, which I think we all know is a popular euphemism for saw each other naked.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99ll just roll for you.\nPenny: Do you have a problem with Justin staying with me?\nLeonard: What was your first clue?\nSheldon: Uh-oh! Industrial accident.\nPenny: You know what? Don\xe2\x80\x99t talk to me like I\xe2\x80\x99m an idiot.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m not talking to you like you\xe2\x80\x99re an idiot! I\xe2\x80\x99m saying the whole idea is idiotic!\nSheldon: You accidentally stare at a helium-argon laser. Lose one turn and a retina.\nPenny: How is that not talking to me like I\xe2\x80\x99m an idiot? It\xe2\x80\x99s my friend, it\xe2\x80\x99s my couch, and it\xe2\x80\x99s my freakin\xe2\x80\x99 life!\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s also your roll.\nLeonard: You know what? It is your life. If you want to have some stupid guitarist stay on your couch, then fine. Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you just rent some bunk beds and invite The Black Eyed Peas?\nPenny: Hey, if I want to invite the entire line up of Lollapalooza to sleep in my apartment, I will, and it\xe2\x80\x99s none of your business!\nLeonard: Are you listening to yourself? Do you know how childish you sound right now?\nPenny: Oh, now I\xe2\x80\x99m a child? Well, at least I\xe2\x80\x99m not an idiot anymore!\nLeonard: The two aren\xe2\x80\x99t mutually exclusive!\nPenny: Oh, you are such a\xe2\x80\xa6 (Sheldon has placed ice in the blender and turned it on) What the hell is he doing?\nLeonard: He\xe2\x80\x99s drowning us out. He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like fighting.\nPenny: Sheldon, just stop, look, the fight is over. Oh, and FYI, you never even heard of The Black Eyed Peas until you met me!\nLeonard: I heard of \xe2\x80\x99em. Didn\xe2\x80\x99t know they were a band. Sheldon, she\xe2\x80\x99s gone. You can turn off the blender.\nSheldon: Has your relationship reached its inevitable ugly end?\nLeonard: No, we just had a little spat.\nSheldon: Look on the bright side. As the result of Penny\xe2\x80\x99s forfeit, you have become the world\xe2\x80\x99s first winner of Research Lab. Would you like a commemorative snow cone?\nCredits sequence\nScene: Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s car.\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t get how she can just announce that an old boyfriend is going to be sleeping on her couch.\nSheldon: Hey, I thought of a game we can play in the car.\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to play a game, Sheldon.\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s called Scientists. Now, I will name three scientists, then you will put them in order of the size of their contribution to their respective fields. To make this game even more compelling, you must consider only the contribution of the man to the field, not the validity of the field itself. For example, Abu Musa Jabir ibn Hayn made a greater contribution to the discredited field of alchemy than Halbert Vanderplatt made to neurobiology. Okay, ready to have some fun?\nLeonard: An old boyfriend who\xe2\x80\x99s definitely not gay. That\xe2\x80\x99s what a guy likes to hear, definitely.\nSheldon: All right, I\xe2\x80\x99ll start with an easy one, um, Isaac Newton, Madame Curie and Niels Bohr.\nLeonard: And then I say one little thing and I end up being the bad guy!\nSheldon: Hint, Madame Curie had her husband to help her.\nLeonard: What am I supposed to say? Sure, Penny, I\xe2\x80\x99m cool with your old boyfriend sleeping in your apartment. Well, Leonard, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter if you\xe2\x80\x99re cool or not because I\xe2\x80\x99m Penny and I\xe2\x80\x99m pretty and I can do whatever the hell I want! Oh, I get it! You think you\xe2\x80\x99re doing me a favour just by being in a relationship with me! No, no, Leonard! I\xe2\x80\x99m doing you a favour just by being in the same room as you!\nSheldon: Leonard! Stop the car!\nLeonard: What?\nSheldon: I can\xe2\x80\x99t listen to the two of you fight anymore.\nScene: Leaving the apartment.\nSheldon: Come on, come on, we\xe2\x80\x99re late.\nLeonard: Calm down, we\xe2\x80\x99ll make the movie.\nSheldon: I believe my alarm is appropriate, given the situation. The movie starts in 17 minutes, which means we\xe2\x80\x99ll need to make all the lights on Colorado Boulevard, plus skip the concession stand, and preshow urination.\nRaj: Oh, dude, I wish you had said something before I pounded that last Red Bull.\nSheldon: Go, go, Power Rangers, go!\nPenny: Hey.\nLeonard: Hey. We\xe2\x80\x99re, uh, going to the movies.\nSheldon: No, we\xe2\x80\x99re not. We\xe2\x80\x99re standing in the hallway, suffering through an awkward encounter.\nLeonard: Hang on. They\xe2\x80\x99re showing a new digital print of Time Bandits, you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to come, would you?\nPenny: Not really, no.\nSheldon: All right, invitation pointlessly offered, invitation declined as expected, everyone\xe2\x80\x99s civil, nobody\xe2\x80\x99s fighting. Have a nice evening.\nLeonard: Just give us a minute.\nHoward: Oh, take all the time you need.\nLeonard: So, are we going to talk about last night?\nPenny: Are you ready to apologize?\nLeonard: No.\nPenny: E-e-e-e-eh! Wrong answer, but thank you for playing.\nLeonard: Oh, come on. This is stupid.\nPenny: Oh, there it is again! You think I\xe2\x80\x99m stupid!\nLeonard: No, there\xe2\x80\x99s a difference between being stupid and acting stupid.\nPenny: Oh, yeah? well, there\xe2\x80\x99s a difference between being a jerk and being an ass!\nLeonard: No, there isn\xe2\x80\x99t! They\xe2\x80\x99re synonyms!\nRaj: Well, that was rather unpleasant.\nHoward: Yeah, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I need my preshow urination anymore.\nSheldon: Leonard, when that woman moved in three years ago I told you not to talk to her, and now look, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be late for the movies.\nScene: The comic book store.\n  Howard: Hey! Look! Amazing Spider-Man 183.\nSheldon: Got it.\nHoward: Remember this one? Spider-Man loses a big fight and then his girlfriend breaks up with him. Want me to get it for you? It\xe2\x80\x99ll help take your mind off things.\nStuart: Hey, guys. What\xe2\x80\x99s going on?\nLeonard: Oh, we need to kill a couple hours till the next showing of Time Bandits.\nStuart: Oh, well, no problem. I was thinking of closing early and going home, but let\xe2\x80\x99s face it, that\xe2\x80\x99s just a slightly smaller lonely room filled with comic books.\nLeonard: Thanks, Stuart. Let me ask you something. Do you think it\xe2\x80\x99s okay for Penny to have an ex-boyfriend sleep on her couch?\nHoward: No, I mean, she\xe2\x80\x99s obviously way out of line.\nLeonard: Thank you!\nHoward: But if she dumps you, she\xe2\x80\x99ll have a new boyfriend by tomorrow morning and you\xe2\x80\x99ll have a new girlfriend when you figure out how to build one. So the only question is, how long until you fold?\nLeonard: I am not going to fold.\nRaj: Well, excuse me, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think Penny\xe2\x80\x99s out of line at all. You don\xe2\x80\x99t own her. It\xe2\x80\x99s like my girl, Beyonce says, if you like it, you shoulda put a ring on it.\xe2\x80\x9d\nHoward: Come on. At the very least, when she found out Leonard was upset about it, she should\xe2\x80\x99ve backed off.\nRaj: You mean like when a guy\xe2\x80\x99s upset because his friend agreed to take a cooking class with him and then doesn\xe2\x80\x99t show up because he\xe2\x80\x99s doing a juice fast with his mother?\nHoward: I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know you were upset about that.\nRaj: Really! Did you miss all the subtle indicators, like me saying, Howard, I am upset.\nHoward: Okay, sorry.\nRaj: Maybe it means something different in this country. Back in India, it means you\xe2\x80\x99re upset with a guy named Howard!\nHoward: I said I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.\nRaj: Sorry doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make up for the fact that I had to make chicken and rice with this vegan guy. Do you know what vegan chicken and rice is? Rice!\nHoward: Yeah, well, you think I was having fun, sitting around all night listening to my mother say \xe2\x80\x9cHave you ever peed so much in your life?\xe2\x80\x9d\nRaj: Oh, my God, you are such a mama\xe2\x80\x99s boy.\nHoward: Hey, don\xe2\x80\x99t bring my mother into this!\nRaj: You brought your mother into this!\nSheldon: Stop it, both of you. All this fighting, I might as well be back with my parents! Damn it, George, I told you if you didn\xe2\x80\x99t quit drinkin\xe2\x80\x99 I\xe2\x80\x99d leave you! Well, I guess that makes you a liar, \xe2\x80\x99cause I\xe2\x80\x99m drunk as hell and you\xe2\x80\x99re still here! Stop yelling! You\xe2\x80\x99re making Sheldon cry! I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what\xe2\x80\x99s making Sheldon cry! That I let you name him Sheldon.\nHoward: Boy, what got him so upset?\nRaj: Oh, sure, you can tell when Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s upset.\nScene: The Cheesecake Factory.\n  Penny: Oh, thank you very much. Come back soon. With the other half of my tip. Hey, Sheldon, what are you doing here?\nSheldon: This is a restaurant. It\xe2\x80\x99s lunchtime. I would think, as a waitress, you\xe2\x80\x99d be familiar with the paradigm.\nPenny: Is Leonard coming?\nSheldon: No, I believe Leonard is waiting for you to come crawling back to him and apologize.\nPenny: Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s not gonna happen.\nSheldon: I assumed that would be your attitude. Hence, my true purpose in coming here.\nPenny: Which is?\nSheldon: I want you to crawl back to him and apologize.\nPenny: I\xe2\x80\x99m busy.\nSheldon: Excuse me, miss. I\xe2\x80\x99d like to order lunch.\nPenny: Fine. What do you want?\nSheldon: I have a few questions. First, I notice that you offer soup and a half-sandwich?\nPenny: Yes.\nSheldon: Where exactly does the half-sandwich come from? Are you giving me half of someone else\xe2\x80\x99s sandwich, or do I have to wait for someone else in the restaurant to order the other half?\nPenny: No, no, Sheldon, they just make a half-sandwich.\nSheldon: You can\xe2\x80\x99t make a half-sandwich. If it\xe2\x80\x99s not half of a whole sandwich, it\xe2\x80\x99s just a small sandwich.\nPenny: Okay, fine, it\xe2\x80\x99s soup and a small sandwich. Is that what you want?\nSheldon: Of course not. I\xe2\x80\x99ll have my usual.\nPenny: Great.\nSheldon: Aren\xe2\x80\x99t you going to ask me if I want a beverage?\nPenny: Don\xe2\x80\x99t you usually get lemonade?\nSheldon: Yes.\nPenny: Do you want lemonade?\nSheldon: Yes.\nPenny: Anything else?\nSheldon: Yes, I want you to apologize to Leonard.\nPenny: I am not going to apologize. I\xe2\x80\x99ve done nothing wrong. He is completely overreacting.\nSheldon: Irrelevant. The disruption in your relationship is making my life intolerable.\nPenny: Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, Sheldon, but this really isn\xe2\x80\x99t about you.\nSheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t follow.\nPenny: Yeah, yeah, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be right there. Look, Sheldon, I have to go.\nSheldon: All right, let\xe2\x80\x99s assume, ad argumentum, that in this case, Leonard is wrong.\nPenny: Leonard is wrong.\nSheldon: Considering the number of transgressions you\xe2\x80\x99ve committed that he\xe2\x80\x99s overlooked, don\xe2\x80\x99t you think that, just this once, you could return the favour?\nPenny: I\xe2\x80\x99m coming. Goodbye, Sheldon. What do you mean, transgressions I\xe2\x80\x99ve committed?\nSheldon: Were you under the impression that Leonard has no complaints about you?\nPenny: Like what? Yeah, yeah, I see you, you\xe2\x80\x99re making a little cheque sign in the air, I got it, just hold your horses. What does Leonard complain about?\nSheldon: Your driving, the plethora of stuffed animals on your bed that stare at him during your amorous activities, your constant tardiness, your singing.\nPenny: My singing?\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s actually from my list, but Leonard would be a fool if he didn\xe2\x80\x99t agree with it.\nPenny: Okay, if Leonard has so many problems with me, why hasn\xe2\x80\x99t he just said so?\nSheldon: Because, according to him, you\xe2\x80\x99re oversensitive and have a temper.\nPenny: Oh, really? Well, then, do me a favour and tell Leonard that he can drop dead!\nSheldon: And she wonders why she\xe2\x80\x99s constantly undertipped.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: Hey.\nSheldon: Oh, good, you\xe2\x80\x99re home. I need you to do me a favour.\nLeonard: Sure.\nSheldon: Go apologize to Penny.\nLeonard: What?\nSheldon: Right now would be good.\nPenny (knocking): Leonard!\nSheldon: Although, a few minutes ago would have been better.\nPenny: I hear you don\xe2\x80\x99t like my stuffed animals, my driving or my punctuality.\nLeonard: What? Who would tell you something like that? Why would you tell her something like that?\nPenny: It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter why he told me. It\xe2\x80\x99s true, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\nLeonard: Okay, yeah, it\xe2\x80\x99s true, but I can live with that stuff. What I can\xe2\x80\x99t live with is you casually informing me that some guy\xe2\x80\x99s going to be staying in your apartment without even asking me first!\nPenny: That isn\xe2\x80\x99t even your problem, the problem is you don\xe2\x80\x99t trust me!\nLeonard: Oh, come on. Sheldon, have you ever once heard me say that I don\xe2\x80\x99t trust Penny? Sheldon? Where did he go?\nPenny: Oh, your yelling must have freaked him out again.\nLeonard: Where are you going? You just walk away in the middle of an argument?!\nPenny: No, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to go find your damn roommate before he hurts himself trying to cross the street or something!\nLeonard: Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you say so?\nPenny: Oh, now I need your permission for that, too?!\nLeonard: Well, I can\xe2\x80\x99t read your mind, Penny!\nPenny: Really? Why not? You\xe2\x80\x99re so smart, and I\xe2\x80\x99m so dumb!\nScene: Raj\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Raj. (Knock, knock, knock) Raj. (Knock, knock, knock) Raj.\nRaj: Stop knocking! It\xe2\x80\x99s open! Please tell my parents that our dark matter research is at a critical juncture, and I can\xe2\x80\x99t come home for my cousin Sanjay\xe2\x80\x99s wedding.\nMrs Koothrappali: Sheldon, ask our son what we\xe2\x80\x99re supposed to say to Mr. and Mrs. Choudhry, whose daughter, Lakshmi is flying in from London, for the sole purpose of meeting him.\nRaj: I didn\xe2\x80\x99t ask you to set me up with Lakshmi.\nMrs Koothrappali: You should be thanking us!\nDr Koothrappali: Yes, Lakshmi just got her stomach stapled. You have an opportunity to get in good with her before she loses weight, and her self-esteem goes up.\nRaj: I don\xe2\x80\x99t care! And why don\xe2\x80\x99t you think I can find a woman for myself?\nMrs Koothrappali: Because you\xe2\x80\x99re 27, and the closest thing we have to a daughter-in-law is that Jewish boy Howard.\nRaj: Oh, that is completely below the belt. Sheldon, tell my parents that Howard and I are just friends. Sheldon? Howard and I are just friends! Fine. I\xe2\x80\x99ll come home for Sanjay\xe2\x80\x99s wedding.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s car.\nPenny (out of the window): Sheldon! (whistles)\nLeonard: What are you doing? He\xe2\x80\x99s not a lost dog.\nPenny: Hey, why don\xe2\x80\x99t you just let me find him while you sit there hitting your imaginary brake?\nLeonard: The brake might be imaginary, but that stop sign you just ran wasn\xe2\x80\x99t.\nPenny: What stop sign?\nLeonard: Eyes on the road. Eyes on the road!\nScene: Outside Howard\xe2\x80\x99s house. Sheldon rings the doorbell.\nHoward\xe2\x80\x99s Mother: Howard, answer the door! I\xe2\x80\x99m busy!\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m busy too, you answer it.\nHoward\xe2\x80\x99s Mother: I can\xe2\x80\x99t! I\xe2\x80\x99m on the toilet!\nHoward: For God\xe2\x80\x99s sake, I don\xe2\x80\x99t need to hear that! Can\xe2\x80\x99t you just say, I\xe2\x80\x99m busy?\nHoward\xe2\x80\x99s Mother: I said I\xe2\x80\x99m busy, but that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t good enough for you!\nHoward: You know what? I hope it\xe2\x80\x99s one of those home invasion deals, and they shoot me in the head.\nHoward\xe2\x80\x99s Mother: Well, if it\xe2\x80\x99s a home invader, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell them I\xe2\x80\x99m on the toilet!\nHoward: There\xe2\x80\x99s no one there. You\xe2\x80\x99re hearing things, you crazy old lady!\nScene: The comic book store.\nLeonard: Hey, Stuart, have you seen Sheldon?\nStuart: Yeah, he\xe2\x80\x99s, uh, over in the graphic novel section. Built himself a little nest.\nLeonard: Thank you.\nStuart: Uh, Penny?\nPenny: Yeah?\nStuart: Is everything okay?\nPenny: What do you mean?\nStuart: Uh, Sheldon told me you and Leonard were having a fight?\nPenny: Oh, yeah, kind of. It\xe2\x80\x99s, it\xe2\x80\x99s no big thing.\nStuart: Oh, good, good. (She moves away) I love you.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m not leaving until you talk to me.\nPenny: All right, what\xe2\x80\x99s going on?\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s a little hard to explain. He does this thing where he pretends he\xe2\x80\x99s in an alternate dimension that occupies the same physical space we\xe2\x80\x99re in, but he can\xe2\x80\x99t perceive us.\nSheldon: Don\xe2\x80\x99t flatter yourself. I\xe2\x80\x99m just ignoring you.\nPenny: Come on, Sheldon, let\xe2\x80\x99s go home. Look, we\xe2\x80\x99re done fighting.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard that before, but then, the next thing you know I\xe2\x80\x99m hiding in my bedroom, blaring a Richard Feinman lecture while my mom is shouting that Jesus would forgive her if she put ground glass in my dad\xe2\x80\x99s meatloaf, and my dad\xe2\x80\x99s on the roof skeet-shooting her Franklin Mint collectible plates.\nPenny: Okay, there\xe2\x80\x99s going to no more shouting and no skeet-shooting.\nSheldon: Really? Where\xe2\x80\x99s your friend Justin going to sleep?\nLeonard: Yeah, where\xe2\x80\x99s he gonna sleep?\nPenny: Oh, my God, would you let this go?!\nStuart: I\xe2\x80\x99d let it go.\nLeonard: Why should I let it go? Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you just tell the guy to find another place to sleep? (Sheldon turns on a loud toy robot) Oh, for God\xe2\x80\x99s sakes. So, you have childhood issues, we all have childhood issues, at some point, you just need to grow up and get past them. (Sheldon turns on another robot)\nPenny: Leonard, will you just let me handle this, please? Look, let\xe2\x80\x99s just\xe2\x80\xa6 Sheldon, please,\ntry and understand. Look, Leonard and I are in a relationship, and occasionally, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to fight. But no matter what happens between us, we will always love you. Right, Leonard?\nLeonard: Always is a long time. Sure. Always.\nPenny: You know, how about we buy you this robot, and then we all go home?\nSheldon: I want that one.\nPenny: Okay, you can have that one.\nLeonard: Oh, come on, he\xe2\x80\x99s just going to play with it twice, and then it\xe2\x80\x99ll end up in his closet with all the other junk.\nPenny: Buy him the robot, Leonard.\nSheldon: Can I get this comic book, too?\nPenny: Yes, you can.\nStuart: We meet again.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s bed.\nLeonard: So what did Justin say when you told him he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t sleep on your couch?\nPenny: He\xe2\x80\x99s a musician. He\xe2\x80\x99ll sleep in his own vomit, if he has to.\nScene: The apartment. Sheldon is in his spot. Beside him, a long haired bearded person is asleep. There is a guitar propped up on the arm of the sofa.\nSheldon: I should have asked for much more than a comic book and a robot.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
