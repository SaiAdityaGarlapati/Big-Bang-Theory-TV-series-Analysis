b'Scene: The apartment.\nPenny: Helium.\nSheldon: Yes.\nPenny: Yes.\nSheldon: Taylor Swift.\nPenny: Yes. Pi.\nSheldon: Yes. Kardashian.\nPenny: More specific.\nSheldon: Khloe?\nPenny: Yes.\nSheldon: See, I remembered because if it looks like Kim it\xe2\x80\x99s Kim, if it looks kind of like Kim it\xe2\x80\x99s Kourtney, and if it looks nothing like Kim it\xe2\x80\x99s Khloe.\nPenny: Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s a Venn Diagram, and I remember because I thought to myself, venn is he gonna stop talking about this diagram?\nLeonard: What are you guys doing?\nSheldon: Oh, well, we decided to use our breakfast time to expand our respective knowledge bases.\nLeonard: Oh, let me try.\nPenny: Okay.\nLeonard: Hmm, atom of hydrogen, Adam of Maroon 5, mic drop.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, who is Mike Drop?\nLeonard: Oh, hey, Penny, do you want to go to the airport with me later to pick up my mother?\nPenny: Sure.\nLeonard: Thanks.\nPenny: No problem.\nLeonard: Hey, Penny, um, since you\xe2\x80\x99re already gonna be at the airport, do I need to go?\nSheldon: Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you want to get your mother from the airport?\nLeonard: Well, I can do without the 40-minute car ride where she criticizes every aspect of my life.\nSheldon: She can cover it in a car ride? I could do 40 minutes on your posture alone.\nPenny: You really want me to pick up your mother all by myself?\nLeonard: Hmm, I just feel like it would be a good chance for you to bond.\nPenny: Or a way for you to avoid her?\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what he\xe2\x80\x99s putting on those cards, but you are smarter than ever.\nPenny: Fine, if you really want me to, I will pick your mom up.\nLeonard: Seriously?\nPenny: Yeah, you know what, she is my mother-in-law, and I\xe2\x80\x99d like for us to have a good relationship.\nLeonard: That is very mature of you, so I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna go ahead and say, suckah.\nSheldon: All right, back to learning.\nPenny: Okay.\nSheldon: Oh, easy, Bill Nye the Science Guy.\nPenny: Or as I know him?\nSheldon: Creepy old dude from Dancing with the Stars.\nPenny: Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The comic book store.\nRaj: Did you guys see there\xe2\x80\x99s an Avengers screening? Joss Whedon\xe2\x80\x99s gonna show some deleted scenes and do a question and answer session.\nSheldon: Oh, well, I have a few questions for him about the last Avengers movie, and a whole lot of answers.\nLeonard: When\xe2\x80\x99s the screening?\nRaj: Uh, it\xe2\x80\x99s tonight, but it\xe2\x80\x99s first-come, first-served, so we should probably get there early and wait in line.\nHoward: Let\xe2\x80\x99s do it.\nLeonard: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s busy with my mother, so I\xe2\x80\x99m in.\nSheldon: Oh, bad news. Amy\xe2\x80\x99s making me go shopping with her later, so looks like none of us can go.\nLeonard: You do realize we\xe2\x80\x99re allowed to have fun without you?\nHoward: In fact, that\xe2\x80\x99s usually the trick to it. What time do we need to get there?\nRaj: Uh, I\xe2\x80\x99d say by three.\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re really going without me?\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s not a big deal. Go shopping with Amy, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll save a spot in line for you.\nSheldon: You don\xe2\x80\x99t have the authority to save places in the line. If I do that, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be cutting.\nLeonard: People do it all the time.\nSheldon: You know the golden rule of line etiquette. No cuts, no buts, no coconuts.\nHoward: If you really care that much, there are apps now that\xe2\x80\x99ll let you hire people to do stuff like errands and wait in lines.\nStuart: People are actually waiting in lines as a job? Boy, makes me feel better about my life.\nHoward: Some of these guys make over $20 an hour.\nStuart: And now I feel worse again.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s car.\nBeverly: I\xe2\x80\x99m not surprised Leonard chose to avoid picking me up. He\xe2\x80\x99s battled intimacy issues his whole life. Does he have difficulty maintaining erections?\nPenny: Wow. Didn\xe2\x80\x99t even make it out of the parking lot. Uh, you know what, enough about Leonard. Let\xe2\x80\x99s talk about you. What would you like to do while you\xe2\x80\x99re here?\nBeverly: Dear, I\xe2\x80\x99m a psychiatrist. You don\xe2\x80\x99t have to avoid having intimate conversations with me.\nPenny: Well, I\xe2\x80\x99d actually like for us to be close, but maybe we start with our favourite books and work our way up to my husband\xe2\x80\x99s sex organs.\nBeverly: Very well. What\xe2\x80\x99s the last book you read?\nPenny: Um, does Pottery Barn, Spring count?\nBeverly: Penny, it\xe2\x80\x99s only natural to want your mother-in-law to like you, and I acknowledge I can be an intimidating person. So what can I do to make this process easier for you?\nPenny: Uh, for starters, maybe you can not psychoanalyze everything I say?\nBeverly: And how does it make you feel when I psychoanalyze everything you say?\nPenny: Uncomfortable.\nBeverly: That was a joke, dear.\nPenny: Oh. Sorry. Didn\xe2\x80\x99t know you made those. Hey, listen, what if we have a little mother-in-law, daughter-in-law dinner tonight?\nBeverly: So just the two of us?\nPenny: Or I invite a few girlfriends, \xe2\x80\x99cause hearing you say the two of us just sent a chill right down my spine.\nScene: Amy\xe2\x80\x99s car.\nStuart: Hey.\nAmy: What are you doing here? You\xe2\x80\x99re not Sheldon.\nStuart: I thought that might come up. Sheldon hired me to go shopping with you.\nAmy: Hold on. He paid you to get out of spending time with me?\nStuart: No, it\xe2\x80\x99s not like that. There\xe2\x80\x99s a long line he\xe2\x80\x99d rather stand in. So what are we doing? Old Navy, Build-A-Bear? I get paid either way.\nAmy: We\xe2\x80\x99re not going shopping together.\nStuart: You sure? I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to hold your bag. And Sheldon gave me money for a hotdog on a stick.\nAmy: Can you understand why I might be annoyed right now?\nStuart: Look, lady, I just work here.\nScene: The cinema line.\nHoward: We\xe2\x80\x99ve waited in a lot of lines together, haven\xe2\x80\x99t we?\nSheldon: Remember when we camped out for the Doctor Who panel at Comic-Con?\nRaj: Yeah, sleeping under the stars with other fans who love the show as much as we do.\nLeonard: Waking up, wondering which one of those fans stole our wallets.\nSheldon: Stuart, what are you doing here?\nStuart: Sheldon, you are the most inconsiderate person I have ever met in my entire life. Where do you get off sending me to shop with your girlfriend?\nSheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand. You were happy to do this when I hired you. Why, why are you upset with me now?\nStuart: Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m not upset with you, but Amy\xe2\x80\x99s pretty bent out of shape, so she hired me to let you have it.\nSheldon: Well, I suppose turnabout is fair play.\nStuart: You\xe2\x80\x99re darn right it\xe2\x80\x99s fair play, you selfish jerk.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nAmy: You know, just when I think we\xe2\x80\x99re making progress in our relationship, we revert to our old patterns where thoughts and feelings go unexpressed. I mean, if he didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to go shopping with me, why didn\xe2\x80\x99t he just say so?\nBeverly: Maybe he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get a word in edgewise.\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been going on and on.\nBeverly: Oh, it\xe2\x80\x99s all right, dear. Sheldon has a brilliant and complicated mind. It\xe2\x80\x99s understandable that being in a relationship with him could be trying.\nAmy: I called him babe once. He asked me to get a drug test.\nBeverly: Well, I do admire your resolve. You\xe2\x80\x99re an extraordinary woman.\nAmy: Thank you.\nPenny: You know, she\xe2\x80\x99s my mother-in-law. Why can\xe2\x80\x99t I bond with her like that?\nBernadette: Amy\xe2\x80\x99s with Sheldon who she loves like a son. You\xe2\x80\x99re with her son, who she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t.\nAmy: Do you realize it took me five years to get a massage from him?\nBeverly: Oh, well, that still could be a big step for Sheldon.\nAmy: Three minutes. And he used a kitchen timer. I felt like a soft-boiled egg.\nPenny: You know, being in a relationship with Leonard also comes with its challenges.\nBeverly: Yes. Well, what can you do?\nAmy (knock on door): Maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s Sheldon, here to say he\xe2\x80\x99s sorry.\nStuart: Sheldon says he\xe2\x80\x99s sorry.\nAmy: Bernadette, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you five dollars to slam the door.\nStuart: I would have done it for three.\nScene: The cinema line.\nRaj: Boy, all this standing\xe2\x80\x99s making me tired. Good thing I brought my collapsible stick chair.\nHoward: Not the stick chair. You look like an idiot on that thing.\nRaj: Sticks and stones may break my bones, but chairs on sticks are comfy.\nStuart: Hey.\nSheldon: Hey. Is everything smoothed out with Amy?\nStuart: Uh, no, she\xe2\x80\x99s still pretty mad.\nSheldon: Did you make the apology as sincere as I would have?\nStuart: I said, Sheldon says he\xe2\x80\x99s sorry.\nSheldon: Oh, well, that\xe2\x80\x99s laying it on a little thick.\nLeonard: You think it\xe2\x80\x99s time you apologize to her yourself?\nSheldon: I suppose so. But if I get out of the line, I\xe2\x80\x99ll lose my spot.\nStuart: I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to hold your place till you get back.\nSheldon: You would do that?\nStuart: Consider it my way of getting more of your money.\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re a good man.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nBernadette: So, Beverly, did you know Penny is the number three sales rep at our pharmaceutical company?\nBeverly: Oh, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t realize you two work together.\nBernadette: Well, we don\xe2\x80\x99t exactly. I\xe2\x80\x99m a microbiologist for the research team.\nBeverly: Oh, what are you currently developing?\nBernadette: Some exciting new anti-anxiety drugs.\nBeverly: That\xe2\x80\x99s interesting. I just attended a lecture on pediatric anxiety.\nAmy: Oh, was it, uh, Dr. Jenofski? I just saw his TED Talk.\nBeverly: It was.\nBernadette: Well, let\xe2\x80\x99s get back to Penny. Hey, weren\xe2\x80\x99t you telling me something great about your company car?\nPenny: Um, it has seat warmers.\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy.\nAmy: Come in.\nSheldon: Hello, everyone. Oh, Beverly, good to see you. I\xe2\x80\x99d love to chat, but there\xe2\x80\x99s a line that could start moving any minute, so let\xe2\x80\x99s do this. Amy? A proper apology requires three steps. Step one, an admission of wrongdoing. Amy, I was wrong. Step two, a promise never to repeat said action. Amy, that action will never be repeated, and that\xe2\x80\x99s a promise. Step three, an earnest request for forgiveness. Amy, I hope you can forgive me. And I hope you do it right now, \xe2\x80\x99cause there\xe2\x80\x99s an Uber waiting downstairs, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to repeat this apology nonsense with my driver Ganesh.\nAmy: Fine.\nSheldon: Oh, thanks, you\xe2\x80\x99re a peach. Beverly, we\xe2\x80\x99ll catch up soon. Bernadette, it was a pleasure as always, Penny, you have spinach in your teeth.\nPenny: How long have I had spinach in my teeth?\nBeverly: Since the airport, dear.\nScene: The cinema line.\nHoward: You look like you come with a kickstand.\nRaj: You can\xe2\x80\x99t make me feel bad.\nHoward: Hmm, maybe not. Leonard?\nLeonard: So, when the aliens brought you back, they just left the probe in?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m back.\nLeonard: Hey, how\xe2\x80\x99d it go?\nSheldon: It went well. Yeah, I\xe2\x80\x99ve learned that if you never say you\xe2\x80\x99re sorry, the times you do really puts them on their heels. Uh, Stuart, I relieve you of your line duties.\nStuart: Anyone else need anything before I go?\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you a dollar if you make fun of Raj.\nStuart: That\xe2\x80\x99s mean.\nHoward: Five.\nStuart: You look like Tigger if Tigger looked like a jackass.\nHoward: Uh, if you ever need a reference or anything, just let me know.\nMan: Hey, guys.\nWoman: You made it.\nSheldon: Did you see that? He just cut the line.\nLeonard: He\xe2\x80\x99s just joining his friends; it\xe2\x80\x99s fine.\nSheldon: No, it\xe2\x80\x99s not fine. It is a breach of line etiquette.\nHoward: We\xe2\x80\x99re near the front of the line. We\xe2\x80\x99ll get in either way.\nSheldon: What if every person in front of us let someone cut?\nLeonard: We\xe2\x80\x99d still get in.\nSheldon: What if each of those people let someone cut?\nLeonard: Still get in.\nSheldon: But then each of those people let someone cut?\nLeonard: We\xe2\x80\x99d still get in, but first I\xe2\x80\x99d hit you over the head with his stick chair.\nSheldon: Excuse me.\nLeonard: Oh, please don\xe2\x80\x99t.\nSheldon: Uh, uh, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help but notice that you cut the line.\nMan: Oh, uh, I\xe2\x80\x99m with my friends. It\xe2\x80\x99s cool.\nSheldon: Well, no. It\xe2\x80\x99s not cool. If there were reserved seating, and we all had tickets, that would be fine. But this line is first-come, first-served. Not show up tardy and nevertheless be first served. Right here.\nLeonard: No.\nSheldon: You need to go to the back of the line.\nMan: Uh, who made you line monitor?\nSheldon: Mrs. Wunch in fourth grade. And my slogan was a line that\xe2\x80\x99s straight is a line that\xe2\x80\x99s great.\nMan: Is this guy for real?\nLeonard: Boy, I wish I could say no.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nBeverly: That was very nice of Sheldon to apologize.\nAmy: Well, he\xe2\x80\x99s come a long way. Or a short way very slowly, so it feels like a long way.\nBeverly: Your relationship with him is fascinating. I\xe2\x80\x99m preparing to write a book on high-achieving couples, and I would love to interview the both of you.\nAmy: Oh, sure. I\xe2\x80\x99ll, I\xe2\x80\x99ll talk to Sheldon about it. You know, Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s husband is a former astronaut.\nBeverly: Really? Do you think he would be interested in being interviewed as well?\nBernadette: Do I think he\xe2\x80\x99d be interested? Sometimes I hear him pretending to be interviewed when he\xe2\x80\x99s alone in the bathroom.\nBeverly: Wonderful. I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you my contact information.\nBernadette: Um, you should probably talk to Penny, too.\nBeverly: About what?\nPenny: Okay, you know what? This is ridiculous. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been trying to make a connection with you all day, and clearly I\xe2\x80\x99m getting nowhere.\nBeverly: Well, are you seeking a connection or just some form of validation?\nPenny: What I was seeking was some sort of friendship. But at this point, I\xe2\x80\x99ll take you not insulting me to my face.\nBeverly: My intention was never to insult you.\nPenny: You\xe2\x80\x99ve been doing it all day. Do you even know what an insult is?\nBeverly: Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s not a clinical term. But one example would be your marrying my son, and not inviting me or even telling me the wedding was taking place.\nPenny: Okay, good example.\nScene: The cinema line.\nSheldon: What about Joss Whedon\xe2\x80\x99s work makes you think he\xe2\x80\x99d be okay with rule-breakers and line-cutters?\nMan: The Avengers are rule-breakers. Being vengeful is in their job description.\nSheldon: They work for SHIELD, which is a sanctioned department of the U.S. Government. Do you work for a sanctioned department of the U.S. Government?\nMan: As a matter of fact I do. At a little place called the DMV.\nRaj: He\xe2\x80\x99s got him there. The D even stands for department.\nSheldon: Excuse me, excuse me, can I please see a show of hands? Who here takes issue with this person cutting the line?\nMan: Told you.\nSheldon: Well, what a sad state of affairs. That you\xe2\x80\x99ve all been so ground down by life, you don\xe2\x80\x99t even notice when someone disrespects you.\nHoward: I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe we\xe2\x80\x99re gonna get beat up, and it\xe2\x80\x99s not because of your chair.\nSheldon: You know, right now, at the back of this line, there\xe2\x80\x99s a movie fan like you who\xe2\x80\x99s not going to get in, because this person simply doesn\xe2\x80\x99t care. Yeah, well, 61 years ago, there was another person at the back of the line and her name was Rosa Parks.\nLeonard: Okay, you may have to pretend you\xe2\x80\x99re black to get us out of here.\nSheldon: Now, let\xe2\x80\x99s follow in that brave woman\xe2\x80\x99s footsteps, and stand up for ourselves. And, and I realize that she stood up by remaining seated, but now is not the time to enjoy the irony of that. Now, I ask you again. Who here takes issue with this person\xe2\x80\xa6\nWoman: Why should we listen to you? You cut the line yourself.\nSheldon: I most certainly did not.\nWoman: I saw you.\nMan: If you\xe2\x80\x99re feeling dizzy, it\xe2\x80\x99s because the tables have turned.\nSheldon: Excuse me, I paid someone to wait in line for me, and then when I arrived, he left, so what you saw, my good woman, was swapsies, not cutsies. Oh, no, no, no, no, wait, I ask you all again, a show of hands. Who here takes issue\xe2\x80\xa6 well, stop moving. he\xe2\x80\x99s gonna get in.\nLeonard: Buddy, let it go.\nSheldon: No, I can\xe2\x80\x99t. This isn\xe2\x80\x99t right.\nLeonard: You did everything you could.\nSheldon: No, I could\xe2\x80\x99ve done more.\nLeonard: Now, now, you denigrated the memory of a great civil rights pioneer. That\xe2\x80\x99s all anyone could ask.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nPenny: To be honest, I\xe2\x80\x99m surprised you cared about the wedding at all.\nBeverly: I\xe2\x80\x99m still human, Penny. Not getting invited to my own son\xe2\x80\x99s wedding is difficult to ignore.\nAmy: I know how you feel. She didn\xe2\x80\x99t invite any of us.\nPenny: It was spur of the moment.\nBernadette: But we did get to see a live stream of it on the Internet.\nBeverly: I could\xe2\x80\x99ve watched it on the Internet?\nPenny: Thank you. So if we would have asked you to come to Vegas to see us get married, you would\xe2\x80\x99ve come?\nBeverly: No, I would\xe2\x80\x99ve said you\xe2\x80\x99re making a huge mistake. But an invitation would\xe2\x80\x99ve been nice.\nPenny: You really think we made a mistake?\nBeverly: At the time I did. But I\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen Leonard so happy, so perhaps I was wrong.\nPenny: Wow. Okay. Well, um, how about this? Maybe while you\xe2\x80\x99re still in town, Leonard and I could have another small ceremony. You know, if you\xe2\x80\x99re interested.\nBeverly: I would find that perfectly acceptable.\nPenny: She would find it perfectly acceptable. You guys saw it. We bonded.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom.\nBernadette: Howie? You doing okay? You\xe2\x80\x99ve been in there a while.\nHoward (through bathroom door): I\xe2\x80\x99m fine. Be right out. Am I an American hero? Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s a good question, Jim. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you think once an astronaut leaves the planet, he\xe2\x80\x99s a hero to all the nations of the Earth? Okey dokey. I think I have time for one more question.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
