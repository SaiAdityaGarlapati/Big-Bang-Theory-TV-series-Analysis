b'Scene: The apartment. Penny and Amy are playing a ski-ing game.\nPenny: Wow, you\xe2\x80\x99re really good at this.\nAmy: Well, I have an extremely low centre of gravity. I\xe2\x80\x99m like a pyramid.\nPenny: How you doing over there?\nLeonard: Oh, I hope it\xe2\x80\x99s just a sprain. I cannot walk into that E.R. with another video game injury.\nPenny: Hey, Sheldon, you want to play next?\nSheldon: Oh, I would, but I\xe2\x80\x99m on my way out.\nLeonard: Where?\nSheldon: Texas.\nAmy: Right now? Why?\nLeonard: Is someone sick?\nSheldon: Yes. My sister\xe2\x80\x99s uterus came down with a baby.\nPenny: Oh, she\xe2\x80\x99s pregnant? That\xe2\x80\x99s great. You\xe2\x80\x99re gone an uncle. Uncle Sheldon.\nSheldon: No, I will be Uncle Dr. Cooper.\nAmy: How come you never said she was pregnant?\nSheldon: Well, I never told you about my brother\xe2\x80\x99s kidney stone. You want to hear about everything that comes out of my family\xe2\x80\x99s genitals?\nLeonard: Well, congrats, and it\xe2\x80\x99s nice you\xe2\x80\x99re gonna be there for your sister.\nSheldon: Yes. I\xe2\x80\x99m filling in for her husband who\xe2\x80\x99s recovering from a horrible motorcycle accident. Lucky duck.\nPenny: Wow, so, how long will you be gone?\nSheldon: Well, she\xe2\x80\x99s due tomorrow. Although it did take her six years to finish high school, so who knows?\nAmy: Can I give you a ride to the airport?\nSheldon: Oh, no, thank you, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be an inconvenience. Chop-chop, Leonard. We leave in ten minutes.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: All right, here\xe2\x80\x99s the deal. Sheldon is gone, so the tree decorating rules are out the window.\nPenny: Yeah, which means we don\xe2\x80\x99t have to use his ridiculous ornament-spacing template.\nLeonard: And I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to report its kickstarter campaign is holding strong at zero dollars.\nPenny: Ah.\nRaj: Wait, so Star Wars and Star Trek characters can go on the same branch?\nLeonard: I know, it\xe2\x80\x99s crazy. Welcome to the Thunderdome, people. (All whoop)\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99ve never done this before. It\xe2\x80\x99s kind of fun.\nRaj: Yeah, if your mom could see her little Bar Mitzvah boy right now, she\xe2\x80\x99d have a heart attack.\nBernadette: Good idea, I\xe2\x80\x99ll take a picture.\nPenny: Honey, I\xe2\x80\x99m a little strapped for cash this year, so for Christmas I was thinking of giving you this.\nLeonard: I love it.\nPenny: Okay.\nLeonard: But it is what you got me last year.\nPenny: Yeah.\nLeonard: And last night.\nStuart: Hello.\nVarious: Hey, Hi, Stuart. etc\nStuart: Oh, good, I\xe2\x80\x99m glad you guys didn\xe2\x80\x99t wait for me to start. Although you said seven and it\xe2\x80\x99s, it\xe2\x80\x99s seven, but that\xe2\x80\x99s fine.\nAmy (ringing from tablet): Oh, it\xe2\x80\x99s probably Sheldon. Hi, Sheldon. Everybody\xe2\x80\x99s here, say hi.\nPenny: Hi.\nLeonard: Hey, buddy.\nRaj: Hey.\nHoward: Howdy.\nBernadette: Hi.\nStuart: Hello.\nSheldon: The second I go out of town you throw a Christmas party without me?\nAmy: Yeah, kinda.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s so thoughtful. You guys are the best.\nPenny: Hey, how\xe2\x80\x99s your sister?\nSheldon: <i>She went into labor an hour ago.\nAmy: That\xe2\x80\x99s wonderful. So you\xe2\x80\x99re at the hospital?\nSheldon: No, she chose to have a home birth because she wants to live in the Stone Age and a cave wasn\xe2\x80\x99t available.\nRaj: You know, many people believe that home births are better because the mother is in a warm, comfortable environment where she can be nurtured by loved ones.\nSheldon: And turn the bedroom floor into an amniotic Slip \xe2\x80\x98n Slide.\nMrs Cooper (off): Shelly, come on. Your sister\xe2\x80\x99s fully dilated and she wants a nice family picture before there\xe2\x80\x99s blood everywhere.\nSheldon: Oh, boy. I picked the wrong day to wear my good robot T-shirt.\nRaj: If you were having Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s baby would you really want him in the room?\nPenny: Yeah, if he\xe2\x80\x99s in the room when they\xe2\x80\x99re making the baby, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you ten dollars.\nBernadette: Hey, I brought over It\xe2\x80\x99s a Wonderful Life if you guys want to watch it later.\nAmy: Oh, I love that movie.\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen it.\nStuart: Me neither.\nAmy: It\xe2\x80\x99s great. It\xe2\x80\x99s Christmastime and Jimmy Stewart\xe2\x80\x99s really depressed and he\xe2\x80\x99s gonna jump off a bridge and kill himself.\nStuart: Don\xe2\x80\x99t need to see it. Living it.\nBernadette: But then he gets to see what the world would be like if he\xe2\x80\x99d never been born.\nPenny: Hey, you ever imagine what that would be like? Not being born?\nLeonard: (Knock, knock, knock) What do you think? (Knock, knock, knock) What do you think? (Knock, knock, knock) What do you think?\nAmy: You make jokes about Sheldon, but if it weren\xe2\x80\x99t for him, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think any of us would be sitting in this room right now.\nHoward: Really? Sheldon not being here is the main reason I\xe2\x80\x99m in this room.\nAmy: It\xe2\x80\x99s true. None of you would know me. You wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t know Bernadette. You wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be dating Penny.\nLeonard: You don\xe2\x80\x99t know that. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been going to the Cheesecake Factory for years. I could have picked her up. (General laughter)\nPenny: Oh, you weren\xe2\x80\x99t joking.\nLeonard: No.\nPenny: Okay, sweetie, let me tell you exactly how that would have gone down.\nFantasy sequence in Cheesecake Factory.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna do it. I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna ask her out.\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna squirt chocolate milk out of my nipples. Sorry, I thought we\xe2\x80\x99re saying things that are never gonna happen.\nRaj: Maybe this time he\xe2\x80\x99s going to do it.\nHoward: Hope you\xe2\x80\x99re thirsty, here it comes.\nLeonard: Watch me.\nPenny: Hey, you guys ready to order or you need a few minutes?\nLeonard: I, uh, ah, um, I\xe2\x80\xa6\nPenny: A few minutes it is.\nRaj: You didn\xe2\x80\x99t ask her out, but that was a lot of sounds.\nLeonard: You guys are making me nervous.\nHoward: Fine, then go talk to her on your own.\nLeonard: I will. Excuse me.\nPenny: Yeah?\nLeonard: Hi, uh, um, I\xe2\x80\x99m Leonard?\nPenny: Really? You don\xe2\x80\x99t sound so sure.\nLeonard: No, I am he. Uh, any, anyway, um, there\xe2\x80\x99s been something I\xe2\x80\x99ve wanted to ask you for a long time. Um.\nPenny: What\xe2\x80\x99s that?\nLeonard: Eh, uh, well, I was wondering, if you\xe2\x80\x99re not too busy, um, uh, if, if you\xe2\x80\x99d be interested in telling me where the restroom is?\nPenny: I think you\xe2\x80\x99re too late.\nEnd fantasy sequence\nLeonard: Come on, I would not have peed my pants.\nHoward: She nailed it.\nRaj: Sounds about right.\nLeonard: But, you forget, I did ask you out in real life.\nAmy: Which couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have happened if you didn\xe2\x80\x99t live across the hall from her, which couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have happened without Sheldon. Same goes with you guys. If Leonard wasn\xe2\x80\x99t with Penny, she never would have set you up.\nHoward: Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter. Bernadette still would\xe2\x80\x99ve been working at The Cheesecake Factory, and I still would\xe2\x80\x99ve been working this beefcake factory. You would\xe2\x80\x99ve been all over me.\nBernadette: Well\xe2\x80\xa6\nFantasy sequence in the Cheesecake Factory.\nBernadette: Hey, Penny, can I take that table?\nPenny: Sure, why?\nBernadette: The one in the turtleneck is cute.\nRaj: Open wide, here comes the happy train.\nHoward: Mm-hmm, chug-a-chug-a, yum, yum.\nRaj: Oh. Hang on. You got a, you got a little something. Ah.\nBernadette: Never mind.\nEnd fantasy sequence.\nRaj: Oh, man, that is so us.\nLeonard: You know, maybe you and I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be together, but you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have done so great yourself.\nPenny: Why?\nLeonard: Because I know exactly the kind of guy you would\xe2\x80\x99ve ended up with.\nFantasy sequence in Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nZack: Hey, babe.\nPenny: Hey. Did you remember to pay the rent?\nZack: Better. I used the money to buy these magic beans.\nEnd fantasy sequence.\nPenny: Hey, he may be an idiot, but at least he didn\xe2\x80\x99t pee himself.\nLeonard: Oh, hold on.\nFantasy sequence.\nZack: Aw, babe, I peed myself.\nPenny: Me, too.\nEnd fantasy sequence.\nLeonard: The end.\nAmy (Tablet ringing): Hi, Sheldon. Everything okay?\nSheldon: No, it\xe2\x80\x99s not. I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen things. Lady things.\nAmy: Listen to me. That is not the way they usually look.\nSheldon: Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter. This is no way to make new humans. People coming out of people. It\xe2\x80\x99s some kind of dirty magic show.\nMrs Cooper (off): Sheldon Lee Cooper. You get back in this room right now. And bring a mop.\nSheldon: Did you hear that? A mop. I have two PhDs yet somehow I\xe2\x80\x99m the janitor of my sister\xe2\x80\x99s birth canal.\nLeonard: Hey, Sheldon sent us all an e-mail. Happy holidays from Texas. And there\xe2\x80\x99s pictures. Aah! Don\xe2\x80\x99t open them. Do not open them.\nPenny: Oh, come on. Childbirth is a natural, beautiful, uuurgh, it\xe2\x80\x99s like someone sawed a cow in half.\nRaj: My father\xe2\x80\x99s a gynaecologist, I think I can handle it. And, now, I\xe2\x80\x99m gay.\nBernadette: You know, I was thinking. Without Sheldon, most of us would have never met, but Penny would still live across from him.\nAmy: And with Leonard out of the picture, we all know what that would mean.\nPenny: We do?\nFantasy sequence in the Laundry Room.\nPenny: Hey, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Hello.\nPenny: Doing laundry?\nSheldon: Of course I\xe2\x80\x99m doing laundry. Saturday night is laundry night, and I\xe2\x80\x99m in a laundry room, so, I believe your inference is justified.\nPenny: Oh, my inference is justified. Sheldon, you are so funny. Anyway, I need to do my laundry, too, because these clothes are so dirty. Almost as dirty as the dirty girl who\xe2\x80\x99s wearing them.\nEnd fantasy sequence.\nPenny: Okay, that\xe2\x80\x99s enough.\nLeonard: Disagree.\nRaj: Keep going.\nHoward: More.\nFantasy sequence.\nPenny: So, what do you think?\nSheldon: A tad asymmetrical, but nothing to be concerned about.\nPenny: Please, Sheldon. I need you.\nSheldon: To what?\nPenny: To take me.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m not taking you anywhere till you put on a shirt.\nPenny: Come on, Sheldon. You and me right here.\nSheldon: Penny, for the thousandth time, I\xe2\x80\x99m saving myself for someone special. Perhaps a cute bespectacled neuroscientist with hair the color of mud.\nPenny: I think I know how to change your mind.\nEnd fantasy sequence.\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99s enough.\nRaj: Ew.\nStuart: I was okay with it.\nAmy (tablet ringing): How\xe2\x80\x99s it going, Sheldon?\nSheldon: Actually, much better.\nLeonard: Oh, good. Is the baby born yet?\nSheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I just got back.\nAmy: Where\xe2\x80\x99d you go?\nSheldon: My mother asked me to get some towels. I took advantage of the vague request and went to Bed, Bath & Beyond. (Scream from other room) Excuse me, I\xe2\x80\x99m on the phone. So rude.\nAmy: Here\xe2\x80\x99s another one. Penny, if it weren\xe2\x80\x99t for Sheldon you never would have met comic book legend Stan Lee.\nPenny: Great.\nRaj: At least Leonard, Howard and I would have always been friends.\nBernadette: Hey, how come you three never got an apartment together?\nLeonard: We talked about it, but Howard was in a pretty serious relationship with his mom.\nHoward: I lived with her to save money.\nRaj: Yeah, you didn\xe2\x80\x99t have to buy groceries \xe2\x80\x99cause you were breast-feeding.\nBernadette: Aw, so I guess if it weren\xe2\x80\x99t for me, you\xe2\x80\x99d still be living with her, huh?\nHoward: Not exactly.\nPenny: What do you mean, not exactly?\nHoward: Well, things would be a little different.\nFantasy sequence in Mrs Wolowitz\xe2\x80\x99s house.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Howard, where\xe2\x80\x99s my lunch? I\xe2\x80\x99m starving.\nHoward: I know you\xe2\x80\x99re starving. The neighbours know you\xe2\x80\x99re starving. There\xe2\x80\x99s starving people in Africa who know you\xe2\x80\x99re starving.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): That\xe2\x80\x99s it? There\xe2\x80\x99s not enough food.\nHoward:Well, you cleaned out Earth. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what else to do.\nBernadette: How is this any different?\nHoward: You didn\xe2\x80\x99t let me finish. Here you go, Mother.\nDead Mrs Wolowitz: You\xe2\x80\x99re a good boy, Howard, such a good boy.\nEnd fantasy sequence.\nAmy: Wait, did she die or did you kill her?\nHoward: Eh, tomato, tomahto. The important thing is she\xe2\x80\x99s dead.\nBernadette: Hey, so how come you two didn\xe2\x80\x99t move in together?\nLeonard: Oh, this guy wanted a place of his own because he was sure he was gonna be a ladies\xe2\x80\x99 man.\nRaj: Yeah, I was wrong. But I do think you and I would have had a great time.\nFantasy scene in Raj\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nRaj: Come on, Leonard, dinner.\nFat Leonard: Coming.\nLeonard: Hang on. Why would I be fat?\nRaj: You\xe2\x80\x99d have no girlfriend to see you naked, you\xe2\x80\x99d try to fill the void with food, and I\xe2\x80\x99m an enabler who once deep-fried a pancake.\nLeonard: Why can\xe2\x80\x99t you be fat, too?\nFat Leonard: What do you want to do for dessert?\nFat Raj: I think there\xe2\x80\x99s still half a cake from breakfast.\nFat Leonard: No, there\xe2\x80\x99s not.\nFat Stuart: Hey, guys.\nFat Leonard and Raj: Stuart!\nEnd fantasy sequence.\nRaj: What are you doing?\nStuart: I just wanted to be in anyone\xe2\x80\x99s story.\nRaj: Yeah, but why are you fat?\nStuart: \xe2\x80\x98Cause Leonard was fat.\nPenny: Amy, what about you? What do you think you\xe2\x80\x99d be doing if you never met Sheldon?\nAmy: It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to say, my life would be so different.\nHoward: You can say better. Sheldon can\xe2\x80\x99t hear you.\nAmy: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\nFantasy sequence in Amy\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nAmy: Happy birthday to me, happy birthday to me, there\xe2\x80\x99s tears in the frosting, happy birthday to me. (Stuart honks a party hooter at her.)\nEnd fantasy sequence.\nStuart: I\xe2\x80\x99ll stop now.\nAmy (tablet ringing): How\xe2\x80\x99s it going, Sheldon?\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s it. The baby\xe2\x80\x99s here. It\xe2\x80\x99s a boy.\nPenny: Aw.\nAmy: Yay.\nRaj: Congrats.\nSheldon: Oh, thank you. I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure I was gonna to make it. But my mother gave me some ice chips, my sister told me to breathe, and I just thought to myself, Sheldon, if you can make it through the Green Lantern movie, you can make it through this.\nLeonard: Well, good for you, buddy. We\xe2\x80\x99ll let you get back in there.\nSheldon: Oh no, no, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going back in there. That baby is so irritating. He has literally been crying his entire life.\nHoward: Aw, he\xe2\x80\x99s already taking after Uncle Shelly.\nAmy: Come on, Sheldon, you should go.\nSheldon: Why?\nAmy: Well, you always complain that you never had an intelligent role model growing up, and now you can be one for your nephew.\nSheldon: Ugh, all right, I\xe2\x80\x99ll go. But from what I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen, his attention span is as limited as his bladder control.\nBernadette: You actually got him to do it.\nRajj: Yeah, you keep saying how much Sheldon has affected all of us, but you\xe2\x80\x99ve clearly had an impact on him.\nAmy: If that were true, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t still be living alone. Well, not exactly alone. I do have a 50 pound sack of rice with one of Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s T-shirts on it.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m telling you, Sheldon cares for you more than you think.\nAmy: I wish I could believe you. I also wish there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a mouse living in Rice Sheldon.\nLeonard: Hang on, I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna give you a little early Christmas present. I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna show you something, but if you ever told Sheldon he\xe2\x80\x99d probably never speak to me again. So, if you want to tell him, that\xe2\x80\x99s fine. Look.\nAmy: I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand.\nLeonard: He made you his screensaver.\nAmy: Oh. Wow. I had no idea. He is so into me. Wait, wait, where\xe2\x80\x99d I go?\nLeonard: Oh, well, it\xe2\x80\x99s you, Swamp Thing, Stephen Hawking, Spider-Man, but, look, you\xe2\x80\x99re in the mix.\nAmy: I am in the mix. And I\xe2\x80\x99m the hottest one.\nPenny: Who\xe2\x80\x99s that?\nLeonard: Oh, Madame Curie.\nAmy: That\xe2\x80\x99s fine, she\xe2\x80\x99s dead.\nScene: The stairwell.\nSheldon: You okay?\nAmy: Just really glad you\xe2\x80\x99re back.\nSheldon: Me, too. I got a lot of TV to catch up on.\nAmy: I missed you.\nSheldon: To quote Han Solo, I know.\nAmy: Did you miss me?\nSheldon: I would\xe2\x80\x99ve preferred to have you there with me.\nAmy: Oh.\nSheldon: Or instead of me.\nAmy: Did you hold the baby?\nSheldon: I did.\nAmy: And? How did it make you feel?\nSheldon: Looking into the blank, innocent eyes of a creature that couldn\xe2\x80\x99t begin to comprehend anything I was saying? Basically just another day at the office.\nFantasy sequence at the Cheesecake Factory.\nFat Leonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna do it. I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna ask her out.\nHoward: And chocolate milk is gonna squirt out of my nipples.\nFat Raj: Put up or shut up. You make it, I\xe2\x80\x99ll drink it.\nPenny: You guys need anything else?\nFat Leonard: Uh, your phone number and one more cheesecake.\nPenny: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, I have a boyfriend. In fact, there he is now. Ready to go, sweetheart?\nStuart: Not until I get my kiss.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
