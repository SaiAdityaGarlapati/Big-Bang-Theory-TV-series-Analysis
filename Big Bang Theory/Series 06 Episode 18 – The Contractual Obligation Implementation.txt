b'Scene: The apartment \nLeonard: Look, I know you guys don\xe2\x80\x99t want to do this, but we have no choice. So, you can either bitch and whine or we can just get it over with.\nHoward: I got whine.\nSheldon: I got the B word.\nLeonard: Yeah, well, it\xe2\x80\x99s in our contract to serve on a university committee. And frankly, this is one I believe in. Okay, here we go. Encouraging more women to pursue a career in the sciences.\nHoward: Come on, if I was any good at convincing women to do stuff, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have spent so much of my twenties in the shower.\nSheldon: If you ask me, this whole thing is a waste of our time.\nLeonard: Helping women? Y\nSheldon: Helping anyone. People should take care of themselves.\nLeonard: Oh, like yesterday, when you made me drive you to the dry cleaners, the pharmacy and the post office?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m not saying people can\xe2\x80\x99t use tools. Even an otter picks up a rock when he wants a clam.\nLeonard: You don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s worthwhile to try to get more women working in science.\nSheldon: I think that\xe2\x80\x99s incredibly sexist of you. I believe in a gender-blind society like in Star Trek, where women and men of all races and creeds work side by side as equals.\nLeonard: You mean where they were advanced enough to invent an interstellar warp drive, but a black lady still answered the space phone?\nHoward: Oh, I did spend a lot of my shower time with Lieutenant Uhura.\nSheldon: Howard\xe2\x80\x99s disturbing recollections aside, I don\xe2\x80\x99t appreciate being forced to do banal committee work.\nLeonard: Yes, I know, you\xe2\x80\x99re too smart for this.\nSheldon: Exactly. It\xe2\x80\x99s like asking the Human Torch to heat up your frozen burrito.\nLeonard: Got it. All right, I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking one way to counter bias in the peer-review process, is for papers to be submitted under gender-neutral names. Like S. Smith instead of Samantha Smith.\nSheldon: I suppose there is a history of professional women using their initials so as not to be pre-judged. Harry Potter\xe2\x80\x99s J.K. Rowling, uh, Star Trek\xe2\x80\x99s D.C. Fontana.\nHoward: Van Nuys pole-dancer D.D. Melons. All right, I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve really helped women today. Let\xe2\x80\x99s fire up the old Xbox.\nLeonard: Guys, please don\xe2\x80\x99t make this a school project where I\xe2\x80\x99m the smart kid doing all the work while the slackers sit back and watch.\nSheldon: We\xe2\x80\x99re not. This time you\xe2\x80\x99re the smart kid doing all the work while the even smarter kids sit back and watch.\nHoward: So, you think I\xe2\x80\x99m one of the smarter kids?\nSheldon: No, you\xe2\x80\x99re a tool I was using to make my point.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: Guys, our topic is encouraging women in science, can you at least play a less sexist game\nSheldon: How is it sexist? My character wields a battle axe as well as any man.\nHoward: Not to mention she has mammary glands that could nurse a family of 30. And have enough milk left over to open a Baskin Robbins.\nSheldon: Mother, warrior-princess, franchise owner, I hear glass ceilings shattering all over town.\nLeonard: Sheldon, you\xe2\x80\x99re always saying how much smarter you are than me. Spend five seconds and come up with one idea on how to get more women into science.\nSheldon: All your ideas address the issue at a university level. By then it\xe2\x80\x99s too late. You need to design an outreach program that targets girls at the middle school level and sets them on an academic track towards the hard sciences.\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99s actually good. Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t I think of that?\nSheldon: Some people are otters, some people are rocks.\nLeonard: I wonder if there\xe2\x80\x99s a way we could give the idea a trial run.\nHoward: Maybe I could call my old middle school, see if we can talk to some of the female students.\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99s great, try to set up something for the three of us to go over there.\nSheldon: Oh, hold on. While I\xe2\x80\x99m comfortable speaking about science, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure I know how to spark the interest of schoolchildren. Better Google it.\nHoward: What exactly are you looking up?\nSheldon: How do I get 12-year-old girls excited.\nLeonard and Howard (together): No!\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nRaj: Thanks again for letting me crash girls\xe2\x80\x99 night.\nPenny: Are you kidding? You brought fancy wine and made fondue. I\xe2\x80\x99ve slept with guys for less. It\xe2\x80\x99s a joke. Based on real events.\nRaj: Anyway, I was hoping I could, uh, pick your brains a little. I\xe2\x80\x99m supposed to take Lucy out Friday and I need a killer first date.\nAmy: Well, evolutionary biology says that women are attracted to a man who is steady n the face of danger, so I recommend an unsafe environment. Seedy bar on the wrong side of the tracks, picnic near a lunatic asylum, a wine tasting on Skid Row.\nRaj: Uh, Lucy has some, uh, social anxiety issues. Maybe we could start with something simpler.\nBernadette: Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you take her to Disneyland? You go on Space Mountain, you\xe2\x80\x99re in the dark, she\xe2\x80\x99s holding onto you.\nPenny: Yeah, but you just have to remember, that ride is shorter than you think and they take a picture of you at the end, so make sure you got your clothes back on. It\xe2\x80\x99s a joke. Based on real events.\nRaj: Mm, Disneyland? I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. With all the crowds and the weird characters walking around, just reminds me too much of India.\nAmy: I haven\xe2\x80\x99t been to Disneyland since I was a kid. We should definitely go one weekend.\nBernadette: Weekends are too crowded.\nPenny: So, blow off work, go on a weekday.\nAmy: Hooky? I\xe2\x80\x99ve never played hooky in my life. My mom said that\xe2\x80\x99s how girls end up addicted to reefer and jazz music.\nPenny: It\xe2\x80\x99s more like how girls end up at a Best Western hotel with a 34-year-old guy named Luther.\nBernadette: Joke?\nPenny: I can laugh about it now.\nBernadette: So, what do you say? This Friday we ditch work and go to Disneyland?\nPenny: I\xe2\x80\x99m in.\nAmy: Me, too.\nRaj: Excuse me, I thought we were trying to solve my problem?\nPenny: Oh, yeah, right. Wait, what was your problem again?\nRaj: I am a man who can\xe2\x80\x99t talk to women, trying to figure out how to go on a romantic date with a girl who suffers from such crippling social anxiety she can\xe2\x80\x99t be around other people.\nPenny: Yeah, that\xe2\x80\x99s a toughie.\nBernadette: Let\xe2\x80\x99s think.\nAmy: Hmm. We doing just Disney or California Adventure, too?\nScene: A school hallway.\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s nice of your old school to let us try out our science talk on some female students.\nHoward: Well, they\xe2\x80\x99re actually pretty excited. I\xe2\x80\x99m their most famous alum. If you don\xe2\x80\x99t count the serial killer who ate all those prostitutes.\nSheldon: This must feel pretty good for you, coming back to your alma mater as an astronaut.\nHoward: Yeah, last time I was here, I was just a scrawny little nerd.\nLeonard: And now you\xe2\x80\x99re also an astronaut.\nHoward: So many memories. I mean, how many times in these hallways was I tripped, punched and spit on? Oh, look, here\xe2\x80\x99s my old locker. I have a masters in engineering and I still can\xe2\x80\x99t figure out how Scott Kapinski got me and my briefcase to fit in there. (Kid bumps into him) Hey.\nKid: What?\nHoward: Nothing.\nSheldon: Smart. We don\xe2\x80\x99t want any problems.\nScene: Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s car.\nAmy: I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe I ditched work for Disneyland.\nBernadette: What did you tell your boss?\nAmy: Oh, I was very clever, I did it in stages. At seven o\xe2\x80\x99clock last night, I called about a problem at the lab and casually mentioned I was going out for seafood. At nine thirty, I called and told him that one of my scallops tasted weird. At eleven thirty, I called and said I was throwing up like a fire hose. At twelve forty-five, I called and made nothing but dry heaving sounds, and now I\xe2\x80\x99m going to Disneyland.\nBernadette: Penny, what did you say?\nPenny: I work at the Cheesecake Factory, I said bye.\nAmy: So, what are we gonna do first?\nBernadette: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know about you guys, but I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna make a beeline for the place that gives you a princess makeover.\nAmy: Ooh, that sounds like fun.\nPenny: You\xe2\x80\x99re kidding, right? We\xe2\x80\x99re not just gonna get drunk and go on rides?\nAmy: Come on, do it with us.\nPenny: All right, whatever. How does it work?\nBernadette: Okay, so, you pick your princess, Sleeping Beauty, Snow White, Cinderella, they give you hair, makeup, the works.\nPenny: Guess it would be fun to be Cinderella.\nAmy: Oh, I want to be Cinderella, too.\nPenny: Yeah.\nBernadette: We can\xe2\x80\x99t all be Cinderella.\nAmy: Then how do we decide?\nBernadette: Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s simple. This was my idea. I\xe2\x80\x99m driving. I\xe2\x80\x99m Cinderella. You bitches got a problem with that, we could stop the car right now.\nScene: A library.\nRaj: Excuse me, I\xe2\x80\x99m meeting a girl here. It\xe2\x80\x99s kind of our first date.\nMan: In a library?\nRaj: She and I are both a little awkward in social situations, so this seemed like a good idea.\nMan: People say I\xe2\x80\x99m a little awkward, too. May I join you?\nRaj: No, you can\xe2\x80\x99t join us. Just go, go climb back up whatever beanstalk you came down from.\nMan (to Lucy): You can do better.\nLucy: Oh, we\xe2\x80\x99re eating here? (Reading) We\xe2\x80\x99re having a texting date? (By text) I love that.\nRaj (by text): As you\xe2\x80\x99re reading, it will help to remember I have an adorable accent.\nScene: A classroom.\nLeonard: Okay, who\xe2\x80\x99s ready for some science? Me, too. Okay, I am Dr. Leonard Hofstadter. I am here with my friends Dr. Cooper and real-life astronaut Howard Wolowitz, and we are going to show you girls how cool a job in science can be. How cool, you ask? Well, how about negative 273 degrees, \xe2\x80\x99cause that\xe2\x80\x99s the temperature at which entropy reaches its minimum value. Did I just learn something new and have fun doing it? What? All right. So now let\xe2\x80\x99s bring out theoretical physicist Dr. Sheldon Cooper.\nSheldon: Hello, female children. Allow me to inspire you with a story about a great female scientist. Polish-born, French-educated Madame Curie. Co-discoverer of radioactivity, she was a hero of science, until her hair fell out, her vomit and stool became filled with blood, and she was poisoned to death by her own discovery. With a little hard work, I see no reason why that can\xe2\x80\x99t happen to any of you. Are we done? Can we go?\nLater.\nHoward: The thing to remember is you can go to outer space, too. I mean, look at me. I went to this very school. Those desks you\xe2\x80\x99re sitting in, I was once superglued to one of them.\nGirl: Did you go to the moon?\nHoward: No, but I did go to the International Space Station.\nGirl: Did you fly the rocket?\nHoward: No, but I was in the rocket. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t actually\xe2\x80\xa6\nGirl: So you just flew around? That\xe2\x80\x99s kind of like my uncle. He\xe2\x80\x99s a flight attendant.\nHoward: No, I\xe2\x80\x99m an American hero. Your uncle brings people nuts, okay?\nLeonard: Alright, alright. Boy, we are learning a lot here, huh? Thank you, astronaut Howard. Um, I am what\xe2\x80\x99s called an experimental physicist, which is super-fun, because I get to test theories and work with lasers. Yes?\nGirl 2: How did you decide to become a scientist?\nLeonard: Uh, excellent question. Um, I suppose I\xe2\x80\x99ve always been into science, you know. My mother and father are scientists, so I was kind of led in that direction. Uh, pushed might be a better way to describe it. To be honest with you guys, when I was your age, I wanted to be a rap star. Like Snoop Dogg, but with a healthy respect for the police. Yeah, no, sure, you laugh. Just like my mother did. After I confided, I was derided and chided, my moms and I collided. She said my dreams were misguided. That\xe2\x80\x99s just a little freestyle.\nScene: The library.\nRaj (by text): My dad\xe2\x80\x99s a gynaecologist in India, so if you\xe2\x80\x99re over there and need a check up, as he likes to say, he\xe2\x80\x99s at your cervix.\nLucy(by text): That\xe2\x80\x99s terrible. Your dad should be sent to the pun-itentiary.\nRaj (by text): That\xe2\x80\x99s a fitting pun-ishment. I still don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you do for a living.\nLucy (by text): Web design.\nRaj (by text): Anything I might have seen?\nLucy (by text): I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. You ever look at porn Web sites?\nRaj (by text): No, never. What is porn?\nLucy (by text): Sorry. Autocorrect. That was supposed to say prom Web sites.\nRaj (by text): Ooh, fun. I love prom. The romance, the gowns, it\xe2\x80\x99s like a fairy tale come to life. Sorry. Autocorrect. That was supposed to say, I like sports.\nScene: The classroom.\nLeonard: I never wanted to play the cello. How do you meet girls playing the cello? Hey, you want to come over to my house and listen to me play an instrument that sounds like a suicidal bumblebee?\nHoward: Quick, pull the fire alarm. Let\xe2\x80\x99s get out of here.\nSheldon: Uh, hello again. Um, yeah, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if women in general have been actively discouraged from pursuing the sciences, but it\xe2\x80\x99s clear you young women here, today, have been. While I was listening to my colleagues waste your time, it occurred to me that it might be much more meaningful to hear about women in science from actual women in science, and, uh, I happen to know two brilliant examples who have agreed to speak to you on the phone right now. Uh, Dr. Rostenkowski, Dr. Fowler, are you there?\nAmy (voice): We\xe2\x80\x99re here.\nSheldon: Thank you for taking time out of your very busy schedule to enlighten these young women.\nAmy: It\xe2\x80\x99s our pleasure. I\xe2\x80\x99m Dr. Fowler, and I\xe2\x80\x99m a neuroscientist.\nBernadette: And I\xe2\x80\x99m Dr. Rostenkowski Wolowitz, and I\xe2\x80\x99m a microbiologist.\nAmy: The world of science needs more women, but from a young age, we girls are encouraged to care more about the way we look than about the power of our minds.\nBernadette: That\xe2\x80\x99s true. Every one of you has the capacity to be anything you want to be.\nPenny: Unless you want to be Cinderella.\nBernadette: Come at me. See what happens.\nScene: The library.\nRaj (by text): This was really fun.\nLucy : My battery\xe2\x80\x99s dying, so I\xe2\x80\x99m just gonna talk. Thanks for today. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been trying to do more things that scare me, and coming here was definitely one of them. But it was also really nice. So thanks, and, um, I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna go. Maybe I could do one more scary thing before I go and give you a kiss good-bye? You know, if that\xe2\x80\x99s okay. Okay. Panic attack. Maybe next time.\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99m counting that as foreplay.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nHoward: Bernie, I\xe2\x80\x99m home. You have fun today?\nBernadette: Yes, and I have a surprise for you.\nHoward: Please be Cinderella. Please be Cinderella.\nBernadette: Well, hello, Prince Charming.\nHoward: Milady.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nLeonard: Hey, how was your\xe2\x80\xa6 what?\nPenny: I can explain. I played hooky with the girls, then we all went to Disneyland and got\xe2\x80\xa6 What are you doing?\nLeonard (undressing): Disneyland. Go on, I\xe2\x80\x99m listening.\nScene: The apartment.\nAmy: Sheldon, all Snow White needs is one little kiss to wake up.\nSheldon: Heard you the first time.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
