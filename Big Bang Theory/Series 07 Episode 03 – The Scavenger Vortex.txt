b'Scene: The Cheesecake Factory\nRaj: So, couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help but notice none of you RSVP\xe2\x80\x99d to my murder mystery dinner party.\nLeonard: Oh, yeah. We were meaning to do that.\nRaj: No, you weren\xe2\x80\x99t because it was a week ago and nobody came. So, if you want to solve the mystery of who stabbed Koothrappali in the back with the weapon of indifference, it was all of you.\nSheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t think thatqualifies as a mystery, we all knew what we were doing.\nAmy: We\xe2\x80\x99re sorry, Rajesh.\nBernadette: Maybe we can do it next week.\nHoward: Whoa, whoa, we\xe2\x80\x99re not that sorry.\nRaj: Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry, I can take a hint. No more murder mystery parties.\nLeonard: Great.\nSheldon: Thank you.\nHoward: Hallelujah.\nRaj: Because I\xe2\x80\x99ve got something even better planned.\nLeonard: Aw.\nHoward: Why?\nSheldon: Come on.\nRaj: Just hear me out. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to make you guys a scavenger hunt like they have at M.I.T.\nHoward: Oh, I loved those. I did them every year there.\nLeonard: We did them at Princeton, too.\nHoward: Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s cute. Like it\xe2\x80\x99s a real college.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s amusing, I was going to say that about M.I.T., but it works for Princeton, too.\nAmy: Scavenger hunts at Harvard were really tough. I always got stuck on the first challenge, trying to find someone to be on a team with me. I guess that story\xe2\x80\x99s more sad than funny.\nPenny: I love scavenger hunts. My friends and I had them all the time.\nLeonard: Oh, these are a little different. There\xe2\x80\x99s a tradition at elite universities\xe2\x80\xa6\nHoward: And Princeton.\nLeonard: A tradition of hunts full of puzzles that rely on logic and obscure knowledge, science.\nPenny: Oh, in ours we would just run around town looking for a store that would sell us beer.\nRaj: So, uh, who\xe2\x80\x99s in?\nLeonard: I think it sounds fun.\nAmy: Yeah, me, too.\nVarious: I\xe2\x80\x99m in, let\xe2\x80\x99s do it.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. Are we really doing this or are we tricking Koothrappali again like with the dinner party?\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: What\xe2\x80\x99s all this?\nSheldon: Oh, everything I could possibly need to win the scavenger hunt.\nLeonard: You really think he\xe2\x80\x99s gonna send us to a bowling alley?\nSheldon: Well, if he does, do you know how filthy those rental balls are? They might as well stand on the corner and give away free rectal exams.\nRaj: Okay, everybody. Who\xe2\x80\x99s ready for a scavenger hunt? (Pumping disco music) Somewhere in the city of Pasadena, I\xe2\x80\x99ve hidden a golden coin. You will be faced with a total of ten puzzles. Each p\xe2\x80\xa6 (cough) each, each puzzle will lead you to the location of the next, the last of which will lead you to the coin. The first team that finds it wins.\nSheldon: He is a born showman.\nRaj: Any questions?\nHoward: Yes, to be fair, do people who went to Princeton get a head start?\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s not funny.\nSheldon: No, Oh, it actually is if you get the joke. It\xe2\x80\x99s based on the premise that Princeton isn\xe2\x80\x99t a very good school.\nLeonard: Ha-ha.\nSheldon: Oh, see? Now he gets it.\nRaj: Okay, guys, go ahead and divide yourselves into teams of two.\nBernadette: Should we just do couples?\nLeonard: Couples sounds great. Or we could mix things up. Maybe pick names out of a hat. Whatever.\nPenny: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you just admit you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be on a team with me.\nLeonard: I just said, couples sound great.\nPenny: Mm-hmm, yeah, you don\xe2\x80\x99t think I\xe2\x80\x99m smart enough. You think I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna be a liability. Even though I totally just used the word liability correctly in a sentence. Yeah.\nLeonard: All right, let\xe2\x80\x99s, let\xe2\x80\x99s do couples. I want to.\nPenny: No, no. Let\xe2\x80\x99s mix things up. I choose Sheldon, and we\xe2\x80\x99re gonna kick your ass!\nSheldon: Really? The only time I\xe2\x80\x99m ever picked first for a team and I\xe2\x80\x99m stuck with the liability?\nAmy: Stop that. Penny is not a liability.\nPenny: Thank you. Do you want to be on my team?\nAmy: Maybe we pick names out of a hat.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment. (Montage with scenes in the apartment and Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom)\nPenny: All right, hurry up and close the door so they can\xe2\x80\x99t hear us. Would you stop pouting? So, you picked my name. Get over it.\nSheldon: Yes, and do you know what the odds are I\xe2\x80\x99d pick your name?\nPenny: No.\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s not hard, one in five. Now you know why I\xe2\x80\x99m pouting.\nRaj (over walkie-talkie): All right, teams. Get ready to open your first puzzle. Go. Do you see what I did? The first puzzle is a puzzle. Oh, my God, how adorable is that? I wish I had a friend like me.\nSheldon: What are you doing? You have to start with the edges.\nPenny: Well, there\xe2\x80\x99s no right way, Sheldon. I already found a few pieces that fit.\nSheldon: Yeah, well, take them apart and start with the edges. And stop wasting time.\nHoward: Wow, you\xe2\x80\x99re really good at puzzles.\nAmy: I did them all the time as a kid. As my mom used to say, when you\xe2\x80\x99re doing a puzzle, it\xe2\x80\x99s like having a thousand friends. She was full of fun lies like that.\nHoward: If it makes you feel any better, my mom\xe2\x80\x99s just full of pound cake.\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry you got stuck with me. I bet you wanted to be with Bernadette.\nHoward: Have you ever played a game with Bernadette?\nAmy: No.\nHoward: Have you ever gone into a steel cage with a wolverine?\nBernadette: Faster, faster, faster! Do you not know that word? It means more fast!\nLeonard: Stop yelling at me.\nBernadette: Hey, you\xe2\x80\x99ll know when I\xe2\x80\x99m yelling at you.\nPenny: Ooh, ooh, it\xe2\x80\x99s the comic book store. All right, come on, that\xe2\x80\x99s where we have to go.\nSheldon: But we haven\xe2\x80\x99t finished the puzzle.\nPenny: But, it, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter. We know the answer, come on.\nSheldon: You think you know the answer. But it could be a trick. What if when the puzzle\xe2\x80\x99s complete, there\xe2\x80\x99s a sign in the window that says go to the train store?\nPenny: Okay, it\xe2\x80\x99s not gonna say that.\nSheldon: Well, I hope you\xe2\x80\x99re wrong. I really want to go to the train store.\nHoward: It\xe2\x80\x99s the comic book store. Let\xe2\x80\x99s go.\nBernadette: Come on, numb nuts, it\xe2\x80\x99s the comic book store.\nPenny: It\xe2\x80\x99s the comic book store, it\xe2\x80\x99s the comic book store, it\xe2\x80\x99s the comic book store.\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s the comic book store.\nScene: Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s car.\nLeonard: Do you think Penny\xe2\x80\x99s mad at me?\nBernadette: Because you\xe2\x80\x99re in the right lane behind a bus and you won\xe2\x80\x99t go around it? I\xe2\x80\x99m sure she finds it charming.\nLeonard: No, because I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want her on my team.\nBernadette: I\xe2\x80\x99m starting to think she dodged a bullet. The slowest bullet in the world.\nLeonard: Geez, I never realized you were so competitive.\nBernadette: Yeah, I know. Its, it\xe2\x80\x99s probably because I grew up with five brothers and sisters so I had to fight for every\xe2\x80\xa6 Oh, my God, you did not just slow down for a bird, you know they fly, right?\nScene: Howard\xe2\x80\x99s car.\nAmy: I think this is the first time we\xe2\x80\x99ve ever actually been alone together.\nHoward: Huh, I guess you\xe2\x80\x99re right. Wonder why that is?\nAmy: Well, off the top of my head, I\xe2\x80\x99d say we don\xe2\x80\x99t have a lot in common except for the people we\xe2\x80\x99re involved with. Plus, when we first met, Penny warned me never to get into a car alone with you.\nHoward: Yeah. You know, I bet you and I have more in common than we think.\nAmy: Such as?\nHoward: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Tell me some things you like.\nAmy: Uh, let\xe2\x80\x99s see. I like harps, Little House on the Prairie, medieval poetry, medieval literature\xe2\x80\xa6\nHoward: Hey, how about some music?\nAmy: Great. Sheldon never lets me listen to music in the car. He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to be mistaken for a gang member.\nHoward: Find something you like.\nAmy: Beatles, boring. Eminem, scary. Weird Al? How old are you? Neil Diamond?\nHoward: Yeah, I love Neil Diamond.\nAmy: I love Neil Diamond.\nBoth: Sweet Caroline, bum-ba-da, good times never seemed so good, so good, so good, so good. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been inclined\xe2\x80\xa6\nScene: The comic book store.\nRaj: Oh, hey, thanks for letting me use the comic book store as part of the scavenger hunt.\nStuart: Oh, my pleasure. Always happy to help out with fun things that I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t invited to be a part of.\nRaj: Oh, congratulations. You\xe2\x80\x99re the first team to arrive.\nAmy: Yes, it\xe2\x80\x99s not a ruse to make fun of me. It\xe2\x80\x99s a real game and I\xe2\x80\x99m winning it.\nRaj: Your next puzzle is a riddle. And who better to give it to you than The Riddler?\nBernadette: Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go! How am I faster than you? I\xe2\x80\x99m in heels and I stopped to take a phone call.\nLeonard: I have asthma. Back off.\nHoward: Riddle me this. Arrah, Arrah, and gather round, the work of this hero is legion-bound. He multiplies N by the number of He, and in this room the thing you\xe2\x80\x99ll see.\nRaj: Good riddle, huh?\nStuart: Yeah. So when you guys plan fun activities, does my name even come up, or\xe2\x80\xa6?\nRaj: I invited you to my murder mystery party.\nStuart: No, you didn\xe2\x80\x99t.\nRaj: Oh.\nPenny: Ugh, we\xe2\x80\x99re the last ones here, hurry up.\nSheldon: It is a marathon, not a sprint.\nPenny: People run in a marathon.\nSheldon: Not with a bowling ball on their back.\nLeonard: Hey, Penny, I just wanted to say good luck, and I hope there\xe2\x80\x99s no hard feelings.\nBernadette: Hey, Romeo. Repair your relationship on your own time.\nLeonard: Relax, it\xe2\x80\x99s a hard puzzle. It\xe2\x80\x99s gonna take a while to solve.\nPenny: Riddle me this\xe2\x80\xa6\nSheldon: Got it.\nPenny: Hey, Princeton, look at that, Team Community College Night School is in the lead.\nSheldon: I thought we were the Lightning Sharks.\nHoward: Hey, you know what this could mean (whispers).\nAmy: Oh, oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s good. Then this would be (whispers back)\nHoward: That\xe2\x80\x99s it.\nAmy: To the Neil Mobile.\nBernadette: I knew it, we\xe2\x80\x99re gonna lose.\nLeonard: Wait, I got it. I got it/\nBernadette: Congratulations, you got it last.\nLeonard: You\xe2\x80\x99re really mean, you know that?\nStuart: So no one\xe2\x80\x99s gonna buy anything.\nScene: The geology lab at the University.\nPenny: Aha. Okay, let\xe2\x80\x99s see. To continue on your quest, leave no stone unturned. Ooh.\nSheldon: The next clue must be hidden under one of these rocks.\nPenny: Oh. Okay. Sheldon, I, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to ask, how did you figure out that it was the geology lab?\nSheldon: Oh, simple, the \xe2\x80\x98arrah, \xe2\x80\x98arrah in the riddle mean Jan Arrah, a member of the Legion of Superheroes, known as Element Lad. And then the word He, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the masculine pronoun, but rather H e, the abbreviation for helium. See where I\xe2\x80\x99m going with this?\nPenny: Yes.\nSheldon: Nice try. Now, Element Lad\xe2\x80\x99s ability is the power to transmute chemical elements. Helium has an atomic number of two. If you multiply that by the atomic number of N, nitrogen, you get 14, which is the atomic number of? I\xe2\x80\x99m just funnin\xe2\x80\x99 you, silicon. And that is the most common element in the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s surface. So that narrowed it down to the geology lab or the chemistry lab.\nPenny: Wow. I can drink a beer underwater.\nSheldon: And I\xe2\x80\x99m sure your parents are proud. Now, finally, the line in this room the thing you\xe2\x80\x99ll see was an obvious reference to Fantastic Four member The Thing, who\xe2\x80\x99s made entirely of\xe2\x80\xa6\nPenny: Shut up. I solved it.\nSheldon: Those are map coordinates. Got \xe2\x80\x99em. Let\xe2\x80\x99s go.\nPenny: Well, wait. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you want to know how I figured it out?\nSheldon: No one likes a know-it-all, Penny.\nScene: Howard\xe2\x80\x99s car.\nHoward: On the boats and on the planes.\nAmy: They\xe2\x80\x99re coming to America.\nHoward: Never looking back again.\nAmy: They\xe2\x80\x99re coming to America\xe2\x80\xa6 \xe2\x99\xaa\nScene: Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s car.\nLeonard: Um, I\xe2\x80\x99m okay with you driving my car. I\xe2\x80\x99m not okay with you flying my car.\nBernadette: Don\xe2\x80\x99t sweat it, my dad\xe2\x80\x99s a cop. He can fix things.\nLeonard: Uh-huh. Like death?\nBernadette (out of the window): Your kid may be an honour student but you\xe2\x80\x99re a moron.\nLeonard: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s not answering my texts.\nBernadette: Who cares? Focus on the game.\nLeonard: This stupid game is why she\xe2\x80\x99s mad in the first place. I\xe2\x80\x99m telling her I\xe2\x80\x99m quitting.\nBernadette: No. Quitting would be the worst thing for your relationship.\nLeonard: Why?\nBernadette: Because it would make you seem like something she already thinks you are.\nLeonard: What does she think I am?\nBernadette: How do I put this? She\xe2\x80\x99s been known to call you a name that usually applies to a lady part. Or a cat. Or a willow.\nLeonard: I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe she would say that about me.\nBernadette: If you\xe2\x80\x99re gonna cry about it there\xe2\x80\x99s tissues in my purse. Unless you got some in yours. Big willow.\nScene: Howard\xe2\x80\x99s car.\nHoward: They\xe2\x80\x99re coming to America, They\xe2\x80\x99re coming to America.\nAmy: Today!\nHoward: Today!\nTogether: Today! Today!\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s car.\nSheldon: Okay, another 30 feet.\nPenny: Okay. Oh, it\xe2\x80\x99s a bowling alley.\nSheldon: Yes. Yes. My brain is better than everybody\xe2\x80\x99s.\nScene: The geology lab.\nHoward: Love on the rocks.\nAmy: Ain\xe2\x80\x99t no big surprise.\nHoward: Just pour me a drink.\nAmy: And I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you some lies.\nScene: The apartment stairwell. Leonard is lowering himself down the lift shaft.\nLeonard: Call me a lady part. We\xe2\x80\x99ll see about that.\nBernadette: Can you reach the clue?\nLeonard: Almost.\nBernadette: Hurry, Sheldon and Penny were right behind us in the bowling alley.\nLeonard: Got it.\nBernadette: Great, climb back up. Come on.\nLeonard: Yeah, Penny might be onto something.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s car.\nSheldon: To the planetarium.\nPenny: Let\xe2\x80\x99s go.\nScene: Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s car.\nLeonard: To the tar pits.\nBernadette: Let\xe2\x80\x99s go.\nScene: Howard\xe2\x80\x99s car.\nAmy: There\xe2\x80\x99s a Neil Diamond concert next month.\nHoward: Let\xe2\x80\x99s go.\nScene: The laundry room.\nPenny: Three bags, no one\xe2\x80\x99s opened \xe2\x80\x99em. we\xe2\x80\x99re the first ones here.\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s dirty laundry. You\xe2\x80\x99re up.\nPenny: What? Why me?\nSheldon: Because you\xe2\x80\x99ve been training for this your whole life. You live in a pile of dirty laundry.\nBernadette: They\xe2\x80\x99re here first. This is because you made me slow down for that blind guy.\nPenny: Okay, the clue must be in the bag.\nLeonard: The clue must be in the bag.\nPenny: It\xe2\x80\x99s just a bunch of pants.\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s just a bunch of pants.\nPenny: You know, I\xe2\x80\x99m surprised you want to copy my answers since I\xe2\x80\x99m not even smart enough to be on your team.\nLeonard: Well, why would you want to be on someone\xe2\x80\x99s team who you like to call a, I can\xe2\x80\x99t even say it in front of Sheldon.\nPenny: What are you talking about?\nLeonard: You know exactly what I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about.\nBernadette: No, she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t. I just made that up.\nLeonard: Why would you do that?\nBernadette: Because you were about to quit like a big, Sheldon, cover your ears.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m not a child. I know the word ninny.\nPenny: Yeah, well, you should have quit \xe2\x80\x99cause I\xe2\x80\x99m still gonna beat your ass.\nBernadette: Wish I had a man like her on my team.\nLeonard: Hey, I am every bit as much of a man as Penny. Now, let\xe2\x80\x99s do this.\nSheldon: Wait, it\xe2\x80\x99s not all pants, there\xe2\x80\x99s one shirt.\nPenny: Oh.\nSheldon: Hey, that\xe2\x80\x99s my shirt.\nLeonard: This one is, too.\nSheldon: No, no, that\xe2\x80\x99s not mine. It has a big spot on it.\nPenny: But wait. So does this one.\nBernadette: Maybe the spot\xe2\x80\x99s the clue.\nPenny: Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s spot. The coin is in your spot.\nSheldon: Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s clever.\nPenny (off): Hurry.\nSheldon: Be there in a minute. I just have to pre-soak these.\nScene: The stairwell.\nBernadette: Stop her, Leonard, stop her.\nPenny: Well, where the hell\xe2\x80\x99s the coin?\nLeonard: Wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the answer Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s spot?\nRaj: Oh, yes, Leonard. Yes, it was.\nBernadette: Then where\xe2\x80\x99s the coin?\nRaj: Yes, exactly. Where is the coin? Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you look in your pockets? I slipped them in there earlier today.\nPenny: I don\xe2\x80\x99t get it.\nRaj: Don\xe2\x80\x99t you see? When we\xe2\x80\x99re all having fun together, we\xe2\x80\x99re already winners. Oh, look. See? Even I\xe2\x80\x99m a winner.\nLeonard: Are you kidding me?\nPenny: That is the stupidest thing I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever heard.\nBernadette: You suck so hard.\nRaj: Well, I thought\xe2\x80\xa6 Come on, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want anyone to feel bad at the end of the game. And some of those puzzles were really hard and I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know who was gonna get Penny.\nPenny: Run.\nRaj: Okay, okay, that-that came out wrong, but you have to admit, you all had a wonderful time.\nPenny: Run to India.\nRaj: I just wanted to do something beautiful.\nSheldon (entering): Hey, look. I won.\nScene: The Cheesecake Factory, karaoke night.\nHoward: Hey, she got the way to move me, Cherry,\nAmy: She got the way to groove me.\nHoward: Cherry, baby\nAmy: She got the way to move me, honey.\nTogether: She got the way to groove me.
