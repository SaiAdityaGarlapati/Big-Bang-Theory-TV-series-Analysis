b'Scene: The Cheesecake Factory. Raj and Sheldon are arm wrestling while playing tetris. There is a cacophony of cries such as \xe2\x80\x9ctake him down\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9che\xe2\x80\x99s got you, Sheldon.\xe2\x80\x9d\nPenny: Hey, guys, guys, some of the other waitresses wanted me to ask you something.\nLeonard: Oh, it\xe2\x80\x99s called trestling.\nHoward: It combines the physical strength of arm wrestling with the mental agility of tetris into the ultimate sport.\nPenny: Yeah, that\xe2\x80\x99s terrific, but what they wanted me to ask you was to cut it the hell out. (To someone off) Right come on guys, come on. (Singing while approaching another table) Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you\xe2\x80\xa6\nSheldon: We might as well stop, it\xe2\x80\x99s a stalemate. You\xe2\x80\x99re beating me in tetris, but you\xe2\x80\x99ve got the upper body strength of a Keebler Elf.\nRaj: Keebler Elf? I\xe2\x80\x99ve got your Keebler Elf right here. (Strains to push Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s arm down. Tries using both hands, still with no effect.) Okay, it\xe2\x80\x99s a stalemate.\nPenny: So Leonard, will we be seeing you on Saturday for your free birthday cheesecake?\nSheldon: He can\xe2\x80\x99t eat cheesecake, he\xe2\x80\x99s lactose intolerant.\nPenny: Okay, he can have carrot cake.\nSheldon: What about the cream cheese frosting.\nPenny: he can scrape it off.\nLeonard: Forget about the cake, how did you know that my birthday is Saturday?\nPenny: I did your horoscope, remember, I was going to do everybody\xe2\x80\x99s until Sheldon went on one of his typical psychotic rants.\nSheldon: For the record, that psychotic rant was a concise summation of the research of Bertram Forer, who in 1948 proved conclusively through meticulously designed experiments, that astrology is nothing but pseudo scientific hokum.\nPenny: Blah blah blah, a typical Taurus. So, seriously, are we going to see you Saturday?\nLeonard: Oh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think so.\nPenny: Why not?\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t celebrate my birthday.\nPenny: Shuddup, yeah you do.\nLeonard: No, it\xe2\x80\x99s no big deal, it\xe2\x80\x99s just the way I was raised. My parents focussed on celebrating achievements, and being expelled from a birth canal was not considered one of them.\nPenny: Uh, that\xe2\x80\x99s so silly.\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s actually based on very sound theories, his mother published a paper on it.\nPenny: What was it called, \xe2\x80\x9cI hate my son and that\xe2\x80\x99s why he can\xe2\x80\x99t have cake?\xe2\x80\x9d\nSheldon: It was obviously effective, Leonard grew up to be an experimental physicist. Perhaps if she\xe2\x80\x99d also denied him Christmas he\xe2\x80\x99d be a little better at it.\nLeonard: Thank you.\nHoward: Well I love birthdays, waking up to Mom\xe2\x80\x99s special French Toast breakfast, wearing the birthday king crown, playing laser tag with all my friends.\nPenny: Yeah, see, that\xe2\x80\x99s what kids should have.\nHoward: Actually that was last year.\nPenny: So you\xe2\x80\x99ve really never had a birthday party?\nLeonard: No. But it was okay. I mean, when I was little I\xe2\x80\x99d think maybe my parents would change their mind, and surprise me with a party, like this one birthday I came home from my Cello lesson, and I saw a lot of strange cars parked out front, and when I got to the door I could hear people whispering, and I could smell German chocolate cake, which is my favourite.\nPenny: And?\nLeonard: Uh, it turns out my grandfather had died.  \nPenny: Oh my God, that\xe2\x80\x99s terrible.\nLeonard: Oh, it was kind of like a birthday party. I got to see all my cousins and there was cake, so\xe2\x80\xa67\nPenny: That\xe2\x80\x99s the saddest thing I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever heard.\nHoward: You think? Go ahead, tell her about your senior prom.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: Leonard is exiting the apartment.\nHoward (voice from inside): Make sure they remember no peanuts.\nLeonard: Howard, every Thai restaurant in town knows you can\xe2\x80\x99t eat peanuts. They see me coming they go \xe2\x80\x9cah, no peanut boy!\xe2\x80\x9d\n(Leonard exits down stairs. A moment later, Penny peeks out of her apartment, checks the coast is clear, and crosses the hall to the guys apartment. Knocks.)\nSheldon (answering): Hello Penny. Leonard just left.\nPenny: I know. I want to talk to you.\nSheldon: What would we talk about? We\xe2\x80\x99ve no overlapping areas of interest I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of, and you know I don\xe2\x80\x99t care for chit-chat.\nPenny: Okay, can you just let me in.\nSheldon: Well alright, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t see this as a promising endeavour.\nPenny: Okay, here\xe2\x80\x99s the deal, we are going to throw Leonard a kick-ass surprise party for his birthday on Saturday.\nSheldon: I hardly think so, Leonard made it very clear he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want a party.\nHoward: Did someone say party?\nPenny: He just doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know he wants one because he\xe2\x80\x99s never had one.\nHoward: I suppose that\xe2\x80\x99s possible, but for the record, I\xe2\x80\x99ve never had a threesome and yet I still know I want one.\nPenny: Howard, here\xe2\x80\x99s the difference. The possibility exists that Leonard could have a birthday party before hell freezes over.\nHoward: Fine. If I do have a threesome, you can\xe2\x80\x99t be part of it. I\xe2\x80\x99m just kidding, yes you can. Can you bring a friend?\nSheldon: I think a birthday party is a terrible idea. I envy Leonard for growing up without that anguish.\nPenny: Anguish?\nSheldon: Year after year, I had to endure wearing conical hats while being forced into the crowded sweaty hell of bouncy castles, not to mention being blindfolded and spun towards a grotesque tailless donkey as the other children mocked my disorientation.\nPenny: Okay, sweetie, I understand you have scars that no non-professional can heal, but nevertheless we are going to throw Leonard a birthday party.\nSheldon: Have I pointed out that I am extremely uncomfortable with dancing, loud music and most other forms of alcohol induced frivolity.\nPenny: Nevertheless we are\xe2\x80\xa6.\nSheldon: In addition I really don\xe2\x80\x99t think that Leonard wants a\xe2\x80\xa6\nPenny: Okay, here\xe2\x80\x99s the deal, you either help me throw Leonard a birthday party or, so help me God, I will go into your bedroom and I will unbag all of your most valuable mint condition comic books. And on one of them, you won\xe2\x80\x99t know which, I\xe2\x80\x99ll draw a tiny happy face in ink.\nSheldon: You can\xe2\x80\x99t do that, if you make a mark on a mint comic book it\xe2\x80\x99s no longer mint.\nPenny: Sheldon, do you understand the concept of blackmail?\nSheldon: Well of course I\xe2\x80\xa6 oh! Yeah, I have an idea, let\xe2\x80\x99s throw Leonard a kick ass birthday party.\nScene: Howard and Raj sneak up the stairwell carrying presents. Howard knocks on Penny\xe2\x80\x99s door, a combination of two knocks, two knocks, one knock. Nothing happens. He tries again. Sheldon opens the door.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s not the secret knock. This is the secret knock. (He knocks two, one, two.)\nHoward: What difference does it make?\nSheldon: The whole point of a secret knock is to establish a non-verbal signal to verify the identity of one\xe2\x80\x99s co-conspirators.\nPenny: Is that Raj and Howard?\nSheldon: Possibly, but unverified.\nHoward: Can you just let us in.\nSheldon: Luckily for you this is not a nuclear reactor.\nPenny: So, what did you get the birthday boy?\nHoward: Well, Raj got him an awesome limited edition Dark Knight sculpture based on Alex Ross\xe2\x80\x99s definitive Batman, and I got him this amazing autographed copy of the Feynman lectures on physics.\nPenny: Nice. I got him a sweater.\nHoward: Okay, well, he might like that, I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen him\xe2\x80\xa6 chilly.\nPenny: Uh, Sheldon, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see your present.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s because I didn\xe2\x80\x99t bring one.\nPenny: Well why not?\nHoward: Don\xe2\x80\x99t ask.\nSheldon: The entire institution of gift giving makes no sense.\nHoward: Too late.\nSheldon: Let\xe2\x80\x99s say that I go out and I spend fifty dollars on you, it\xe2\x80\x99s a laborious activity, because I have to imagine what you need, whereas you know what you need. Now I can simplify things, just give you the fifty dollars directly and, you could give me fifty dollars on my birthday, and so on until one of us dies leaving the other one old and fifty dollars richer. And I ask you, is it worth it?\nHoward: Told you not to ask.\nPenny: Well, Sheldon, you\xe2\x80\x99re his friend. Friends give each other presents.\nSheldon: I accept your premise, I reject your conclusion.\nHoward: Try telling him it\xe2\x80\x99s a non-optional social convention.\nPenny: What?\nHoward: Just do it.\nPenny: It\xe2\x80\x99s a non-optional social convention.\nSheldon: Oh. Fair enough.\nHoward: He came with a manual.\nSheldon: Question, how am I going to get Leonard a present before the party? I don\xe2\x80\x99t drive, and the only things available within walking distance are a Thai restaurant and a gas station. I suppose I could wrap up an order of mee krob and a couple of lottery scratchers.\nPenny: Okay, let\xe2\x80\x99s do this, um, I will drive Sheldon to get a present, and Howard, you need to get rid of Leonard for about two hours.\nHoward: No problem.\nPenny: And then Raj, you bring the stuff across the hall and start setting up.\nHoward (after Raj whispers in his ear): What if guests show up?\nPenny: Entertain them.\nHoward: What if they\xe2\x80\x99re women?\nPenny: Stare at them and make them feel uncomfortable.\nScene: The apartment. Leonard is playing an X-Box game.\nHoward (entering): Hey!\nLeonard: Hey.\nHoward: How\xe2\x80\x99s it going?\nLeonard: Fine.\nHoward: So, listen, the New Art is showing the revised definitive cut of Blade Runner.\nLeonard: Seen it.\nHoward: No, you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the 25th anniversary final cut. This one has eight seconds of previously unseen footage. They say it completely changes the tone of the film.\nLeonard: Oh. Pass.\nHoward: Come on, afterwards there\xe2\x80\x99s a Q & A with Harrison Ford\xe2\x80\x99s body double.\nLeonard: Look, I am in the Halo battle of my life here, there\xe2\x80\x99s this kid in Copenhagen, he has no immune system so all he does is sit in his bubble and play Halo 24/7.\nHoward: Can\xe2\x80\x99t you play him some other time?\nLeonard: Not if you believe his doctors.\nHoward: Oh my God, do you smell gas.\nLeonard: No.\nHoward: Yeah, no.\nScene: An electrical store.\nPenny: Alright, you know they have DVDs over there.\nSheldon: Yes, but they have DVD burners over here. Leonard needs a DVD burner.\nPenny: Sheldon, a gift shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be something someone needs, it should be something fun, you know, something they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t buy for themselves.\nSheldon: You mean, like a sweater?\nPenny: Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s a fun sweater, it\xe2\x80\x99s got a bold geometric print.\nSheldon: Is it the geometry that makes it fun.\nPenny: Okay, the point is, one of the ways we show we care about people is by putting thought and imagination into the gifts we give them.\nSheldon: Okay, I see, so not a DVD burner.\nPenny: Exactly.\nSheldon: Something he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t buy for himself. Something fun. Something like\xe2\x80\xa6 oh, an 802.11n wireless router.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: Here you go, Copenhagen boy, how about a taste of Hans Christian Hand Grenade. (Raj enters carrying party supplies. Howard waves him away while in the background Leonard is heard saying \xe2\x80\x9coh, that did not feel good.\xe2\x80\x9d) Come on, come on, oh you clever little\xe2\x80\xa6. Come on, come on, take that!\nHoward (picks up a granola bar from the table, breaks off half and puts it in his back pocket.): Oh-oh. (Louder) Oh-oh!\nLeonard: What\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\nHoward: This granola bar, there\xe2\x80\x99s peanuts in it.\nLeonard: Oh my God, why did you eat it?\nHoward: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, it was just there.\nLeonard: Well if I had a gun there, would you have shot yourself?\nHoward: Don\xe2\x80\x99t yell at me, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to go to the emergency room.\nLeonard: Now?\nHoward: No, after my tongue has swollen to the size of a brisket.\nLeonard: Alright, um, just, uh, let me get my keys.\nHoward: Oh God, oh God, oh God, oh\xe2\x80\xa6. (into phone after Leonard leaves room) The laundry is out of the hamper. (Looks exasperated) Okay Sheldon, what was it supposed to be? Fine, it\xe2\x80\x99s out of the washer. I\xe2\x80\x99ll call you when it\xe2\x80\x99s in the dryer.\nLeonard (running in): Alright, let\xe2\x80\x99s go. (They exit, with Howard making croaking noises.)\nScene: The store. Sheldon is looking at two routers.\nSheldon: What do you think.\nPenny (pointing randomly): Um, that one.\nSheldon: Because of the two additional Ethernet ports.\nPenny: Sure.\nSheldon: He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t need them, he\xe2\x80\x99s already got a 640 connect switch\nPenny: Oh, okay then this one.\nSheldon: Why?\nPenny: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, the man on the box looks so happy.\nSheldon: Penny! If I\xe2\x80\x99m going to buy Leonard a gift, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to do it right. I refuse to let him experience the same childhood trauma I did.\nPenny: Oh, I know I\xe2\x80\x99m going to regret this but, what trauma?\nSheldon: On my twelfth birthday I really wanted a titanium centrifuge, so, you know, I could separate radioactive isotopes.\nPenny: Of course.\nSheldon: Instead of a titanium centrifuge, my parents bought me\xe2\x80\xa6 wow, this is hard. They got me\xe2\x80\xa6 a motorised dirt bike.\nPenny: No?\nSheldon: What twelve year old boy wants a motorised dirt bike?\nPenny: All of them.\nSheldon: Really?\nPenny: Yeah.\nSheldon: Huh?\nPenny: Okay, so we\xe2\x80\x99re getting this one?\nSheldon: Yeah, I suppose.\nPenny: Okay, let\xe2\x80\x99s go.\nRandom woman: Excuse me, do you know anything about this stuff?\nSheldon: I know everything about this stuff.\nWoman: Okay, I have my own wholesale flower business, and I want to hook up my computer in the front entrance with the one in my refrigerated warehouse.\nPenny: Here, buy this one. Look, it\xe2\x80\x99s the one we\xe2\x80\x99re getting, see, happy guy available.\nSheldon: No, no, no, no, she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want that, she needs a point to point peer network with a range extender.\nWoman: Thank you.\nRandom guy: Which hard drive do I want, firewire or USB?\nSheldon: It depends on what Bus you have.\nGuy: I drive a Chevy Cavalier.\nSheldon: Oh, dear lord.\nPenny: Sheldon, we have to go.\nSheldon: Not now, Penny, this poor man needs me. (To woman approaching) You hold on, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be right with you. What computer do you have, and please don\xe2\x80\x99t say a white one?\nScene: The hospital. Howard runs in and up to the counter.\nHoward: Excuse me.\nNurse: Fill this out, have a seat.\nHoward: No, listen, see we\xe2\x80\x99re throwing my friend a surprise party and I\xe2\x80\x99m supposed to keep him out of his apartment for two hours.\nNurse: Uh-huh, fill this out and have a seat.\nHoward: No, see, the only way I could get him to leave is to tell him I ate a peanut. Because I\xe2\x80\x99m allergic to peanuts.\nNurse: Oh, well in that case fill this out and have a seat.\nHoward: Look, all I need from you is to take me in the back and give me a band-aid so I can pretend I had a shot of epinephrine and they you tell my friend you need to keep me under observation for about an hour, hour and a half.\nNurse: Is that all you need?\nHoward: Yes.\nNurse: Get out of my ER.\nHoward: No, you don\xe2\x80\x99t understand.\nNurse: Oh, I understand, but unfortunately this hospital is not equipped to treat stupid.\nHoward: Okay, I get it, I know how the world works, how about if I were to introduce you (holding up a five dollar bill) to the man who freed your people.\nNurse, unless my people were freed by Benjamin Franklin and his five twin brothers you are wasting your time.\nLeonard (running in): Hey, sorry I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t find a parking spot, how are you doing.\nHoward: Bad, very bad.\nLeonard: Really, \xe2\x80\x98cos you don\xe2\x80\x99t look like you\xe2\x80\x99re swelling up at all, maybe we should just pick up some benedryl at the drug store and go home.\nHoward: We can\xe2\x80\x99t go home.\nLeonard: Why not?\nHoward: Becauth (pretends tongue has swollen up) Becauth-th-th. Brissket, Brissket! Water, need water.\nLeonard: Alright, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be right back.\nHoward (into phone): Penny, look, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a problem.\nPenny (with Sheldon in background at the head of a large queue of customers): Yeah, well so do I, look you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to stall Leonard a little longer.\nHoward: I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I can.\nPenny: You have to, we all have to be there at the same time to yell \xe2\x80\x9csurprise!\xe2\x80\x9d\nHoward: Okay, you have to understand something, we\xe2\x80\x99re in a hospital right now.\nPenny: Why, is Leonard okay.\nHoward: Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s fine. I\xe2\x80\x99m fine, thanks for asking, by the way.\nPenny: Okay, I don\xe2\x80\x99t need your attitude, just hold him there a little longer.\nHoward: Look, I\xe2\x80\x99ve done my best but he wants to go home and I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how to stop him.\nPenny: Okay, how about this. You keep him there a little longer and when you get to the party I\xe2\x80\x99ll point out which of my friends are easy.\nHoward: Don\xe2\x80\x99t toy with me, woman.\nPenny: I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a hot former fat girl with no self-esteem, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a girl who punishes her father by sleeping around and an alcoholic who\xe2\x80\x99s two tequila shots away from letting you wear her like a hat.\nHoward: Thy will be done. (Thinks. Reaches into back pocket, finds the half a granola bar from earlier. Looks down.) I\xe2\x80\x99m doing this for you, little buddy. (Takes a bite.)\nScene: The store. Sheldon is on the in-store computer.\nSheldon: Okay, we don\xe2\x80\x99t have that in stock, but I can special order it for you.\nPenny (with shop assistant, points at Sheldon): Him.\nAssistant: Excuse me, sir, you don\xe2\x80\x99t work here.\nSheldon: Yes, well, apparently neither does anyone else.\nPenny: Sheldon, we have to go.\nSheldon: Why?\nPenny: Well, for one thing, we\xe2\x80\x99re late for Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s birthday party. And for another, I told him to call security.\nSheldon (to customer): Good luck. (To assistant) By the way, a six year-old could hack your computer system.\nPenny: Keep walking.\nSheldon: Yeah, 1-2-3-4 is not a secure password.\nScene: The hospital.\nLeonard: Excuse me, my friend is having an allergic reaction to peanuts.\nNurse: No he\xe2\x80\x99s not.\nLeonard: Yes he is.\nNurse: Look, sir we are very busy here and I just don\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\xa6 (sees Leonard whose face has swollen all over) holy crap!\nHoward: Pees hep me!\nNurse: Code 4, I need a gurney, right away, right away.\nHoward: Fank-u.\nScene: The stairwell.\nLeonard: Say what you will about the healthcare system in this country, but when they\xe2\x80\x99re afraid of lawsuits they sure test everything.\nHoward: I really don\xe2\x80\x99t think the colonoscopy was necessary.\nLeonard: You know, before you got all swollen up, I actually thought you were trying to keep me out of the apartment so you could throw me a surprise party.\nHoward: Oh, right, it\xe2\x80\x99s your birthday, I had no idea it was your birthday, I completely forgot, wow, what a lousy way to spend a birthday, well it\xe2\x80\x99s all over now.\nLeonard: There is a party, isn\xe2\x80\x99t there.\nHoward: Maybe.\nLeonard: Howard.\nHoward: Are you mad?\nLeonard: how could I be mad? You actually risked your life because you cared about me.\nHoward: Yeah, that\xe2\x80\x99s why I did it.\nLeonard: Alright. Here we go. My first birthday party.\n(Opens door. Raj is drunkenly singing True Colors very badly into a microphone with his shirt off and a bandana round his head while waving a beer bottle. Penny and Sheldon are asleep on the couch and armchair respectively.)\nRaj: Dude! Everybody left an hour ago! Surprise!\nTime shift. View of a mobile phone video screen. Raj has a woman sitting on his shoulders.\nRaj: Okay Leonard, here I am at your birthday party, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know where you are dude, but it\xe2\x80\x99s really kick-ass. Everyone is very very drunk, and uh\xe2\x80\xa6 (girl pours booze into his mouth) Oh look, there\xe2\x80\x99s a girl taking her shirt off.\nPenny: That\xe2\x80\x99s my friend Carol. Remind me, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to introduce her to Howard.\nRaj: Oh sweet Krishna, shake it, that-a rupee maker.\nPenny: I\xe2\x80\x99m so sorry you didn\xe2\x80\x99t get your party.\nLeonard: Oh, it\xe2\x80\x99s okay.\nPenny: Happy birthday anyways. (She kisses him full on the lips.)\nLeonard: Hey Penny, when, uh, when\xe2\x80\x99s your birthday?\nAdvertisements'
