You\xe2\x80\x99re sure they\xe2\x80\x99re Star Wars tickets?\nLeonard: No, it\xe2\x80\x99s Steel Magnolias 2: Even Steelier.\nSheldon: The Web site\xe2\x80\x99s frozen. I can\xe2\x80\x99t get in.\nLeonard: Yeah, me, too.\nHoward: Same here!\nRaj: Guys, they\xe2\x80\x99re gonna sell out.\nHoward: What are we gonna do?!\nSheldon: All right, this goes against everything I stand for, but desperate times call for desperate measures. Lord, this is Sheldon Cooper. You\xe2\x80\x99re good friends with my mom. I know I\xe2\x80\x99ve spent my life denying that you exist.\nHoward: Got \xe2\x80\x99em.\nSheldon: And I will continue to do so!\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The apartment.\nPenny: I\xe2\x80\x99m really happy you and Amy are back together.\nSheldon: Oh, thank you.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m also really happy, but I can\xe2\x80\x99t pretend it\xe2\x80\x99s for you. New Star Wars in three days.\nSheldon: Hey, Thursday can\xe2\x80\x99t get here soon enough. I\xe2\x80\x99m taking off work to watch the original trilogy while I eat enough Star Wars cereal to choke a Wookiee.\nPenny: Uh, sweetie, you do realize Thursday is Amy\xe2\x80\x99s birthday.\nSheldon: And you do realize I bought my ticket when Amy and I were broken up? I hope you didn\xe2\x80\x99t need anything in that case, \xe2\x80\x99cause it\xe2\x80\x99s closed.\nPenny: You guys just got back together. You might not want to ditch her on her birthday.\nLeonard: I think Penny has a point. You can see it another day.\nSheldon: But someone might spoil the movie. No one can spoil Amy\xe2\x80\x99s birthday for me. Surprise, she\xe2\x80\x99s even older. Who saw that coming?\nPenny: Aw, that\xe2\x80\x99s nice. Put that on her cake.\nScene: Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom.\nArthur: Oh, great. This again.\nSheldon: Arthur, what brings you back?\nArthur: Uh, beats me. I, I just hope this isn\xe2\x80\x99t a, a sex dream.\nSheldon: In the past, you\xe2\x80\x99ve come to me when I\xe2\x80\x99m struggling with a dilemma.\nArthur: And, and the one time where, where you were afraid, and you needed me for, for a night light. What\xe2\x80\x99s, what\xe2\x80\x99s troubling you?\nSheldon: Well, my friends are telling me I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t abandon my girlfriend on her birthday to see the new Star Wars movie.\nArthur: Well, sounds right. Can, can I get out of this muumuu now?\nSheldon: Those are the robes of the Jedi, the guardians of peace and justice in the galaxy.\nArthur: And they, they, they don\xe2\x80\x99t wear underwear.\nSheldon: So, you agree with my friends that I should skip the premiere?\nArthur: Uh, do, do you love this girl?\nSheldon: Yes. But she knows how important Star Wars is to me.\nArthur: Well, maybe you should show her how, how important she is to you.\nSheldon: By seeing the movie she\xe2\x80\x99d want me to see?\nArthur: Sheldon, you, you can see this movie whenever you want. But you only have a limited number of days that you, you can be with this woman. Be with her.\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re right.\nArthur: Great.\nSheldon: Where are you going?\nArthur: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, but hopefully, somewhere I can wear pants.\nScene: Amy\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom.\nAmy (answering phone): Sheldon, what\xe2\x80\x99s wrong?\nSheldon: I wanted to let you know I\xe2\x80\x99ll be spending your birthday with you.\nAmy: Okay.\nSheldon: See, I, I had tickets to the Star Wars premiere that night, but Professor Proton came to me in a dream dressed as Obi-Wan Kenobi and convinced me I should be with you.\nAmy: Obi-what?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99ll, I\xe2\x80\x99ll let you get back to sleep now. Good night.\nAmy: Okay. Good night. Wait. Um, Sheldon, were you actually not gonna spend my birthday with me?\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s late. Got to go. Bye.\nScene: The apartment.\nRaj: Good for Sheldon deciding to stay with Amy on her birthday.\nLeonard: I know. It\xe2\x80\x99s still gonna be weird to see the movie without him.\nHoward: Well, we could wait a couple days and see it together. (all laugh)\nSheldon: Hello.\nLeonard: Hey. We\xe2\x80\x99re going to the comic book store. You want to come?\nSheldon: No, I can\xe2\x80\x99t. I need to make preparations for Amy\xe2\x80\x99s birthday. Which leads me to the following bit of business. This is my ticket to Star Wars. I don\xe2\x80\x99t have to tell you it is worth far more than its face value of fifteen dollars and fifty cents. I trust you\xe2\x80\x99ll give it to someone worthy.\nLeonard: You got it. Well, Penny might want to join us.\nSheldon (to Howard): This is my ticket to Star Wars\xe2\x80\xa6.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny.\nBernadette: What happens if I say, come in?\nPenny: Well, find out.\nBernadette: Come in.\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Bernadette. (Knock, knock, knock) Bernadette. (Knock, knock, knock) Bernadette.\nPenny: Come in.\nSheldon: Keep it up. I got nowhere else to be.\nBernadette: Just come in.\nSheldon: For future reference, if I want to watch Mean Girls, I\xe2\x80\x99ll stream it on Netflix.\nPenny: We\xe2\x80\x99re sorry. What do you need?\nSheldon: Well, as you know, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be celebrating Amy\xe2\x80\x99s birthday with her, and I could use your assistance in helping me select the perfect gift.\nBernadette: Sure.\nSheldon: Well, so far, I\xe2\x80\x99ve come up with three ideas. The first is a chance for her to play the harp with the L.A. Philharmonic.\nPenny: Wow. You can really arrange that?\nSheldon: Well, I said a chance, you know. When you tell them it\xe2\x80\x99s your birthday at Bennigan\xe2\x80\x99s, they make a fuss. I don\xe2\x80\x99t see why the Philharmonic would be any different.\nBernadette: How about something a little more realistic?\nSheldon: Well, Amy enjoys knitting her own sweaters, so I was thinking of getting her an all-expense-paid trip to the Wisconsin Sheep and Wool Festival.\nPenny: Sorry. I was waiting for the bazinga.\nBernadette: Hold on. It could be romantic. The two of them away together, keeping each other warm in snowy Wisconsin.\nSheldon: No, no, no, no. She\xe2\x80\x99d be going alone. Well, if you think I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid of birds, you should see me around sheep.\nPenny: Okay, well, what\xe2\x80\x99s the third option?\nSheldon: That I have coitus with her.\nScene: The comic book store.\nLeonard: What do you think about giving Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s ticket to Stuart?\nRaj: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Have you ever seen a movie with Stuart before?\nHoward: It\xe2\x80\x99s like going with your grandpa. Instead of eating popcorn, he brings little pieces of chicken in Tupperware and a thermos full of soup.\nLeonard: He\xe2\x80\x99s not that bad. Hey, Stuart, got any plans Thursday night?\nStuart: My, uh, my doctor\xe2\x80\x99s worried about my circulation, so I was thinking about walking around the mall. Why?\nLeonard: Well\xe2\x80\xa6\nWil Wheaton: Hey, you guys.\nHoward: Oh, make sure to wear sensible shoes. Wil, want to go to Star Wars Thursday?\nWil: Absolutely.\nStuart: Fine, take Wil. See if he brings you clam chowder.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nPenny: Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. Let\xe2\x80\x99s, let\xe2\x80\x99s, let\xe2\x80\x99s just recap our options. All right, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got harp thing, sheep thing.\nBernadette: Wild thang.\nSheldon: Which do you think she\xe2\x80\x99d prefer? Because I checked the Sheep and Wool Festival Web site, and there\xe2\x80\x99s only 8,000 tickets left.\nPenny: Sheldon, being physical with Amy is a huge step for you.\nBernadette: Yeah, are you ready for this?\nSheldon: Intimacy in any form has been challenging for me, but I\xe2\x80\x99d like to show her how important she is, and it feels like now might be the right time.\nPenny: Sheldon, that\xe2\x80\x99s so beautiful.\nSheldon: Then it\xe2\x80\x99s settled. Amy\xe2\x80\x99s birthday present will be my genitals.\nScene: The stairwell.\nAmy: Thanks for taking me out.\nPenny: Well, you\xe2\x80\x99re spending your birthday with Sheldon. Why not celebrate early?\nBernadette: So where do you want to go?\nAmy: I heard that new Mexican place on Green Street is good.\nPenny: Sure, sure. Or we could take you to get a bikini wax.\nAmy: Why would I get a bikini wax for my birthday?\nPenny: Uh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. It was just a thought.\nAmy: I think I\xe2\x80\x99ll just stick to Mexican.\nBernadette: Great. And then maybe after, we can watch a dirty movie, and if anybody has any questions about what happened or how, we can answer them.\nAmy: Okay, what is going on?\nPenny: Oh, we just want you to be prepared for any surprises that might happen tomorrow.\nAmy: What surprises?\nBernadette: We don\xe2\x80\x99t want to spoil anything, but you should know that Sheldon said he\xe2\x80\x99s ready to be physical.\nAmy: You shut your damn mouth. You actually heard him say this?\nPenny: Yes. He said he wants to do something to show you how much you mean to him.\nAmy: I, I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe it. I, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to say.\nBernadette: Well, we\xe2\x80\x99re really happy for you, and we know how much he cares\xe2\x80\xa6\nAmy: I do know what to say. Let\xe2\x80\x99s get me waxed.\nScene: Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom.\nArthur: Why isn\xe2\x80\x99t it ever Angie Dickinson\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom?\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re back.\nArthur: It, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem like it\xe2\x80\x99s up to me.\nSheldon: I suppose you\xe2\x80\x99re here because I\xe2\x80\x99ve decided to be physical with my girlfriend, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve never done that before.\nArthur: Eh, excuse me for a moment. Well, it was worth a shot.\nSheldon: So, can you help me?\nArthur: Uh, all right. Um, once, once the man gets the, the woman out of her, out of her bloomers\xe2\x80\xa6\nSheldon: Oh, no. Not that. I, I understand the mechanics.\nArthur: Oh, good, good. \xe2\x80\x98Cause, uh, I have no idea what kids these days are calling their, their parts.\nSheldon: I think they say junk.\nArthur: What is happening to this world? What, what do you actually need to know?\nSheldon: This is an important night for us, and I\xe2\x80\x99m worried I might be overwhelmed and ruin everything.\nArthur: Sheldon, if, if you\xe2\x80\x99re with the right person, it, it\xe2\x80\x99ll be okay.\nSheldon: Thank you, Arthur. You are the wisest of the wise.\nArthur: Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s, that\xe2\x80\x99s very nice of you to say, but I think I\xe2\x80\x99m just an expression of, of your unconscious mind.\nSheldon: Oh, sure. Well, you\xe2\x80\x99re fun to look at.\nScene: The apartment.\nRaj: Tonight\xe2\x80\x99s the night.\nLeonard: Yeah, the wait is finally over.\nPenny: I know. Then you\xe2\x80\x99ll finally stop talking about it.\nHoward: Ready to go?\nRaj: Let\xe2\x80\x99s do this.\nPenny: Have fun, guys.\nLeonard: We will.\nRaj: I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe Sheldon gave this up.\nHoward: I know.\nLeonard: We\xe2\x80\x99re gonna have so much more fun than him.\nBernadette: No, they\xe2\x80\x99re not.\nPenny: Knowing them, they will.\nScene: The cinema.\nHoward: T minus 15 minutes.\nRaj: Oh, did you hear from Wil?\nLeonard: Yeah, he\xe2\x80\x99s on his way. Time for bladder check.\nRaj: Check.\nLeonard: Check.\nHoward: Check. Wait. Screw it. I\xe2\x80\x99m holding it.\nRaj: What is everyone booing at?\nWil: Hey, guys. What\xe2\x80\x99s up?\nLeonard: Um, hey, Wil. What you doin\xe2\x80\x99?\nWil: I was on Star Trek. Just rooting for the home team.\nMan: Star Trek stinks!\nWil: Yeah? Live long and suck it.\nScene: Amy\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Birthday girl. (Knock, knock, knock) Birthday girl. (Knock, knock, knock) Birthday girl.\nAmy: Come in.\nSheldon: Oh.\nAmy: Hi, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Hello. Sorry I\xe2\x80\x99m late. I also got you a balloon, but it floated away, and I chased it for a while.\nAmy: That\xe2\x80\x99s okay. Come on in. Thank you. Um, I\xe2\x80\x99ll, I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna go put these in water.\nSheldon: Okay. Ooh, this is different, hmm? Candles and music.\nAmy: Do you like it?\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s kind of spooky.\nAmy: I can change it back.\nSheldon: No, no, no. It\xe2\x80\x99s your birthday. As long as no one jumps out in a hockey mask, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be fine.\nAmy: So, what\xe2\x80\x99d you have in mind for tonight?\nSheldon: I thought I could take you out to a nice birthday dinner. If we pick a place east of here, we might find the balloon.\nAmy: Um, that sounds nice, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not really hungry right now. I thought maybe we could do presents first.\nSheldon: Oh. All right. Um. I should probably tell you something about this gift.\nAmy: You mean before you give it to me?\nSheldon: Yes. May I ask you a question before I give it to you?\nAmy: Of course.\nSheldon: Why are we saying give it to you like that?\nAmy: Sheldon, I know your present is for us to be intimate tonight.\nSheldon: I see. Is that all right? I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, but this is a litigious society. I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna need verbal consent.\nAmy: Yes.\nSheldon: You know what, let me pull a quick contract off the Internet.\nScene: The cinema.\nLeonard: So, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t like Star Wars, why are you here?\nWil: Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m just having fun. Everyone takes Star Wars so seriously. Like if the movie\xe2\x80\x99s bad, it\xe2\x80\x99s gonna ruin their lives.\nRaj: Is it bad? Did you hear something? Oh, my God. It\xe2\x80\x99s bad. Somebody kill me.\nWil: See? That\xe2\x80\x99s what I mean. When you wake up in the morning, whether this is the greatest movie ever or a total piece of crap, your life isn\xe2\x80\x99t gonna change at all.\nHoward: He\xe2\x80\x99s right.\nLeonard: Yeah. No matter what happens, we\xe2\x80\x99re coming back tomorrow to watch it again.\nScene: The apartment.\nBernadette: Do you think Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s actually gonna go through with it?\nPenny: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. He said he\xe2\x80\x99s ready.\nBernadette: Yeah, but he also swore this was the year he\xe2\x80\x99d be able to pull the guts out of a pumpkin.\nPenny: Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna stay positive. I mean, we talked, I told him what women like, and after he stopped giggling, he seemed pretty sure of himself.\nScene: Amy\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom.\nAmy: Hi.\nSheldon: Hello.\nAmy: So, um, should I get under the covers with you?\nSheldon: All right. Hello.\nAmy: Hi.\nSheldon: Why are you shaking? Are you cold?\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99m just, um, really nervous.\nSheldon: Why?\nAmy: Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been waiting for this for so long, I\xe2\x80\x99ve just built it up in my head. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to expect.\nSheldon: Neither do I. But we can find out together.\nAmy: Okay.\nScene: The cinema.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m really nervous.\nHoward: I know. We\xe2\x80\x99ve been waiting so long for this.\nRaj: And we\xe2\x80\x99ve built it up in our heads so much.\nWil: Guys, it\xe2\x80\x99s just a movie.\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99s true.\nHoward: He\xe2\x80\x99s right.\nRaj: It is.\nWil: Although, we all remember Jar Jar.\nRaj: Leonard, I, I\xe2\x80\x99m scared again.\nCaption: A few hours later, in a bedroom not far away\xe2\x80\xa6.\nSheldon: Well, I enjoyed that more than I thought I would.\nAmy: Me, too.\nSheldon: I look forward to your next birthday when we do it again.\nAmy: That works for me.\nScene: The cinema.\nWil: I enjoyed that more than I thought I would.\nRaj: I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I can walk right now.\nScene: Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom.\nArthur: Uh, Sheldon? Sheldon?\nSheldon: Arthur. What are you doing here? I, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I need any more advice.\nArthur: I, I was just curious. How, how\xe2\x80\x99d it go?\nSheldon: Oh. It was amazing. I, I saw it a few days later. What a movie.\nArthur: But, uh, what, what about Amy?\nSheldon: Oh. Uh, uh, she liked it fine. But she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have the history with the franchise I do.\nArthur: Okay. Good, good talk.\nAdvertisements'
