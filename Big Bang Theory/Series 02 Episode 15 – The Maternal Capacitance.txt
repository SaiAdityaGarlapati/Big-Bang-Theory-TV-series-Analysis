b'Scene: The apartment. The guys are playing Rock Band. Sheldon is on guitar, Howard drums and Raj singing. They are performing the Red Hot Chili Peppers \xe2\x80\x9cUnder the Bridge\xe2\x80\x9d. As Raj gets into the song, Penny enters and his singing turns into a squawk.\nPenny: Fellas, please.\nHoward: Penny, come on, we were just finding our sound.\nPenny: You found it. It\xe2\x80\x99s the sound of a cat being run over by a lawn mower.\nLeonard (entering on the phone): I\xe2\x80\x99m really very busy. Is there any way that we can put this off until I have more time to prepare? Of course. But, uh, you understand my trepidation.\nPenny: What\xe2\x80\x99s that about?\nHoward: Not a clue.\nLeonard: Can\xe2\x80\x99t we just postpone it till the spring? Maybe next summer?\nSheldon: This should be fairly easy to deduce. He\xe2\x80\x99s holding the phone to his left ear. Ears do not cross hemispheres, so he\xe2\x80\x99s using the analytical rather than the emotional side of the brain, suggesting that he has no personal relationship with the caller.\nLeonard: No, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t realize it had been so long. Sure, I guess there\xe2\x80\x99s no other choice but to just go ahead and do it.\nSheldon: He\xe2\x80\x99s referring to an activity he has done before. It\xe2\x80\x99s unpleasant and needs to be repeated. This suggests some sort of invasive medical test, like perhaps a colonoscopy.\nLeonard: Aren\xe2\x80\x99t there any other options? There\xe2\x80\x99s not a lot of room, it\xe2\x80\x99s gonna be uncomfortable.\nSheldon: Yes, yes. Yeah, I\xe2\x80\x99m definitely going with colonoscopy.\nLeonard: Okay, bye. My mother\xe2\x80\x99s coming to visit.\nHoward: How about that, you were right.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The lobby. Penny finds a woman studying the lift.\nPenny: It\xe2\x80\x99s out of order.\nWoman: Yes, I can read the sign, I\xe2\x80\x99m just pondering the implications.\nPenny: I think it implies that the elevator doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work.\nWoman: Again, I can read the sign. But the sign and the tape are covered with a layer of dust, which indicates that the elevator has been non-functional for a significant amount of time. Which suggests either a remarkable passivity among the, I assume, 24 to 36 residents of this building based on the number of mailboxes and given typical urban population density or a shared delusion of functionality.\nPenny: You must be Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s mother.\nLeonard\xe2\x80\x99s Mother: Oh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if I must be, but yes.\nPenny: Uh, I\xe2\x80\x99m Penny. I\xe2\x80\x99m his neighbour.\nLeonard\xe2\x80\x99s Mother: Oh, Dr. Beverley Hofstadter.\nPenny: Oh, nice to meet you.\nBeverley: Oh, you\xe2\x80\x99re a hand shaker. Interesting.\nPenny: Uh, why don\xe2\x80\x99t you come with me. I\xe2\x80\x99ll walk you to the apartment.\nBeverley: Oh, all right. Would you like to exchange pleasantries on the way?\nPenny: Yeah, sure, I guess.\nBeverley: All right, you start.\nPenny: Okay. You know, I\xe2\x80\x99ve always been curious. What was Leonard like when he was little?\nBeverley: Oh, I think you mean young. He\xe2\x80\x99s always been little.\nPenny: Right, okay. What was he like when he was young?\nBeverley: You\xe2\x80\x99ll have to be more specific.\nPenny: Oh, um, okay, like, five or six. Five.\nBeverley: Oh, well, at that age he was well enmeshed in what Freud would call the phallic stage of psychosexual development. An outmoded theory, of course, but the boy did spend most of his waking hours with a tight grasp on his penis.\nPenny: Yeah, Leonard mentioned you were a psychiatrist.\nBeverley: Well, that is one of my degrees. My primary field is neuroscience.\nPenny: Oh, well, I\xe2\x80\x99m an actress.\nBeverley: Why?\nPenny: What do you mean why?\nBeverley: Well, there are studies that suggest that many who go into the performing arts suffer from an external locus of identity.\nPenny: Yeah, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what that means.\nBeverley: Well, it means you value yourself only as others value you, which is often the result of unmet childhood emotional needs.\nPenny: Oh, well, I had a wonderful childhood.\nBeverley: Tell me about it.\nSlight time shift.\nPenny: I know my dad wanted a boy. I just, I tried being good at sports, but I hated getting dirty!\nBeverley: And then, I\xe2\x80\x99m assuming, you entered adolescence.\nPenny: Uh-huh, he called me Slugger until I got my first training bra, and then he just stopped playing catch with me. I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t Slugger anymore. Your mother\xe2\x80\x99s here!\nBeverley: If you want to have intercourse with that girl, find out what kind of cologne her father wore.\nLeonard: Good to see you, Mother.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: Here\xe2\x80\x99s your tea, Mother.\nBeverley: Oolong?\nLeonard: Yes.\nBeverley: Loose, not bagged?\nLeonard: Yes.\nBeverley: Steeped three minutes?\nLeonard: Yes.\nBeverley: Two-percent milk?\nLeonard: Yes.\nBeverley: Warmed separately?\nLeonard: Yes.\nBeverley: One teaspoon sugar?\nLeonard: Yes.\nBeverley: Raw sugar?\nLeonard: Yes.\nBeverley: It\xe2\x80\x99s cold.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99ll start again.\nSheldon: I have the same problem with him. My theory is that his lack of focus stems from an over-developed sex drive.\nBeverley:  Oh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know where he would\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten that. Aside from a pro forma consummation of our marriage, his father and I only had intercourse for the purposes of reproduction.\nSheldon: That seems a fairly efficient arrangement.\nBeverley: Yes, we think so. We\xe2\x80\x99ve both done papers on it. Mine from the neuroscientific point of view and his from an anthropological. Mine, of course, was the only one worth reading.\nSheldon: Of course. I would very much like to read about your sex life.\nBeverley: Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s all online or you can order it from the Princeton University Press.\nLeonard: Here\xe2\x80\x99s your tea, Mother. So, what are you guys talking about?\nSheldon: The frequency with which your parents had intercourse.\nLeonard: Swell. If you\xe2\x80\x99re lucky, maybe she\xe2\x80\x99ll show you the PowerPoint presentation.\nBeverley: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, it\xe2\x80\x99s on my other laptop.\nSheldon: Aw\xe2\x80\xa6\nLeonard: So, Mother, what\xe2\x80\x99s new?\nBeverley: You\xe2\x80\x99ll have to be more specific.\nLeonard: All right. Uh, what\xe2\x80\x99s new with you?\nBeverley: Oh, well, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been having some fascinating menopausal symptoms recently.\nLeonard: Maybe something less personal.\nBeverley: Oh. Your Uncle Floyd died.\nLeonard: Oh, my God. What happened?\nBeverley: His heart stopped beating. I have to urinate.\nSheldon: What a remarkable woman.\nLeonard: Yeah I, I thought you guys might hit it off.\nSheldon: I envy you your childhood.\nLeonard: I hate to tell you, but the only warm memories I have of my childhood are of my Uncle Floyd.\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re clearly misremembering. Your mother is brilliant, analytical, insightful, and I\xe2\x80\x99m betting she never hit you with a Bible because you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t eat your Brussels sprouts.\nLeonard: Sheldon, you don\xe2\x80\x99t give your mother enough credit. She\xe2\x80\x99s warm, she\xe2\x80\x99s loving, she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t glue electrodes to your head to measure your brain waves while potty training.\nSheldon: You were lucky. When I was a kid, if I wanted an EEG, I had to attach my own electrodes.\nScene: The university cafeteria.\nHoward: So, Dr. Hofstadter, Leonard rarely talks about his incredibly successful brother and sister.\nLeonard: Please, don\xe2\x80\x99t go there, Howard.\nHoward: I understand that unlike Leonard, they\xe2\x80\x99re at the top of their respective fields.\nLeonard: Boy, you suck.\nBeverley: Well, Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s younger brother, Michael, is a tenured law professor at Harvard, and his sister just successfully grew a human pancreas in an adolescent gibbon.\nHoward: So, she\xe2\x80\x99s close to curing diabetes?\nBeverley: Why else would you grow a pancreas in a teenaged gibbon?\nHoward: Wow, you must be very proud.\nBeverley: Why? They\xe2\x80\x99re not my accomplishments. I have to urinate.\nLeonard: Why are you doing this?\nHoward: You know the rules. You brought your mom to work, you must suffer.\nSheldon: Leonard, I had no idea your siblings were so much more successful than you.\nRaj: Yeah, you\xe2\x80\x99re like the Jar Jar Binks of the Hofstadter family.\nHoward: Oh, meesa think yousa lookin\xe2\x80\x99 so so sad.\nLeonard: You know, rather than mock me, my friends might realize that this is difficult and try to help me through it.\nRaj: Nope, I think mocking you is more fun.\nHoward: Next time, don\xe2\x80\x99t yousa bring mama to work. Okee-day?\nLeonard: That was fast.\nBeverley: Oh, the middle stall was occupied. I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to try again later.\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s totally understandable. In bladder voiding, as in real estate, it\xe2\x80\x99s location, location, location.\nBeverley: So, where were we?\nLeonard: Howard lives with his mother and Raj can\xe2\x80\x99t speak to women unless he\xe2\x80\x99s drunk. Go.\nBeverley: That\xe2\x80\x99s fascinating. Selective mutism is quite rare. On the other hand, an adult Jewish male living with his mother is so common it borders on sociological clich\xc3\xa9.\nHoward: It\xe2\x80\x99s just temporary, I pay rent.\nLeonard: He lives in the same room where his bassinet was.\nBeverley: You know, both selective mutism and an inability to separate from one\xe2\x80\x99s mother can stem from a pathological fear of women. It might explain why the two of you have created an ersatz homosexual marriage to satisfy your need for intimacy.\nHoward: Say what? (Raj whispers in his ear) That\xe2\x80\x99s basically what I just said.\nLeonard: You brought your husband to work, you know the rules. Meesa thinking yousa looking pretty sad now too, betcha, betcha.\nBeverley: Leonard, it\xe2\x80\x99s one o\xe2\x80\x99clock, weren\xe2\x80\x99t you going to show me your laboratory at one o\xe2\x80\x99clock?\nLeonard: There\xe2\x80\x99s no hurry, Mother, tell them more about their secret love for each other.\nBeverley: But it\xe2\x80\x99s one o\xe2\x80\x99clock, you were going to show me your laboratory at one o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\nSheldon: Her reasoning is unassailable. It is one o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\nLeonard: Fine. Let\xe2\x80\x99s go. I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll find my work pretty interesting. I\xe2\x80\x99m attempting to replicate the dark matter signal found in sodium iodide crystals by the Italians.\nBeverley: So, no original research?\nLeonard: No.\nBeverley: Well, what\xe2\x80\x99s the point of my seeing it? I could just read the paper the Italians wrote.\nHoward: Just for the record, we\xe2\x80\x99re not in an ersatz homosexual relationship.\nRaj: Well, then why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you say that to her?\nHoward: Why is it always my responsibility?\nRaj: It\xe2\x80\x99s not always your responsibility. I swear, this is the same thing you did at the comic book store last week.\nHoward: I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe you\xe2\x80\x99re bringing that up.\nRaj: I didn\xe2\x80\x99t bring it up. You did.\nHoward: We\xe2\x80\x99ll talk about this later.\nRaj: You always say that, but we never do.\nSheldon: You went to the comic book store without me.7\nScene: Outside Penny\xe2\x80\x99s door.\n  Penny: Hey.\nLeonard: You got alcohol?\nPenny: Your mom still here?\nLeonard: Yep.\nPenny: Come on in. Wait, wait, she\xe2\x80\x99s not gonna come here looking for you, is she?\nLeonard: Oh, relax. She took Sheldon to the hospital to get a brain scan.\nPenny: Oh, my God. What happened?\nLeonard: Nothing. Mother likes looking at brains and Sheldon likes getting his brain scanned.\nPenny: Geez, what a fun couple.\nLeonard: She\xe2\x80\x99s only been here a day and a half and I\xe2\x80\x99m seriously considering alcoholism as a new career path.\nPenny: Hey, I talked to her for five minutes yesterday and I\xe2\x80\x99ve been half bombed ever since.\nLeonard: You can\xe2\x80\x99t let her get into your head.\nPenny: My head, what about yours?\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s too late for me. My head is her summer house.\nPenny: She was right, you know. The locus of my identity is totally exterior to me.\nLeonard: Oh, yeah, there she is. Hi, Mom.\nPenny: I mean, do you know where I was all morning? Auditioning with 50 other blondes for some stupid antidepressant commercial. And for what? So I\xe2\x80\x99ll finally get my daddy\xe2\x80\x99s approval?\nLeonard: Did you get the part?\nPenny: No, they said I was too perky.\nLeonard: Hey, you want to talk about not getting love from a parent. You know what I used to do when I was little to have some sensation of human contact?\nPenny: Yeah, you grabbed your penis and wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t let go. Your mother told me.\nLeonard: Of course she did. Anyway, that\xe2\x80\x99s not what I was gonna say. When I was ten years old, I built a hugging machine.\nPenny: A hugging machine?\nLeonard: Yeah. I got a dressmaker\xe2\x80\x99s mannequin, I stuffed it with an electric blanket so it would be warm, and built two radio-controlled arms that would hug me and pat my back.\nPenny: Oh, that is so sad.\nLeonard: You know what the saddest part was?\nPenny: What?\nLeonard: My father used to borrow it.\nScene: The stairwell.\n  Beverley: Your scan data will be very elpful to my research. You have a remarkable brain.\nSheldon: I know. Although I\xe2\x80\x99ve always hated how my right frontal lobe looks in pictures.\nBeverley: Common complaint among men. Nothing\xe2\x80\x99s ever big enough, except when they get a tumour. Then you never hear the end of it.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99d love to see a scan of your brain sometime.\nBeverley: Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99ll send you a link, but its physiology is fairly unimpressive.\nSheldon: Oh, I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe that.\nBeverley: Your unwillingness to accept empirical evidence suggests an attempt at flattery.\nSheldon: My apologies. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been living with your son too long. Gotten into some bad habits.\nBeverley: Understandable.\nSheldon: Can I make you a cup of tea?\nBeverley: I doubt it, but if anyone has a chance, it\xe2\x80\x99s probably you.\nSheldon: I feel very comfortable around you.\nBeverley: I feel very comfortable around you, too.\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s surprising because I generally don\xe2\x80\x99t feel comfortable around, well, anyone.\nBeverley: Nor I.\nSheldon: What are the odds that two individuals as unique as ourselves would be connected by someone as comparatively workaday as your son?\nBeverley: Is that a rhetorical point or would you like to do the math?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99d like to do the math.\nBeverley: I\xe2\x80\x99d like that, too.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment. Penny and Leonard are doing tequila shots.\nPenny: Okay, now this time\xe2\x80\xa6\nLeonard: Uh-huh.\nPenny: You\xe2\x80\x99re gonna lick the salt off my neck, do the shot, and then bite the lime.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t hear anything after lick.\nPenny: Neck, shot, lime. (Leonard starts licking her neck. He is there a long time) Okay, shot, lime.\nLeonard: Right. Ah! Where\xe2\x80\x99s the lime? (Penny has the lime in her mouth) Oh, okay, we\xe2\x80\x99re sharing.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: So, what do you think?\nBeverley: I\xe2\x80\x99m very tempted. I\xe2\x80\x99m just not sure it\xe2\x80\x99s appropriate with my son\xe2\x80\x99s roommate.\nSheldon: Normally, I\xe2\x80\x99d feel the same way. But based on everything I\xe2\x80\x99ve observed about us, I can\xe2\x80\x99t help but speculate we\xe2\x80\x99d be very good together.\nBeverley: True. I\xe2\x80\x99ve had a similar observation. It\xe2\x80\x99s certainly something I could never do with my husband.\nSheldon: I was hesitant the first time I tried it, but I experienced an unanticipated and remarkable release of endorphins. It\xe2\x80\x99s quite satisfying.\nBeverley: I see what you\xe2\x80\x99re doing. You\xe2\x80\x99re appealing to the neuroscientific researcher in me.\nSheldon: You see right through me, don\xe2\x80\x99t you?\nBeverley: Only when you\xe2\x80\x99re in a CAT scanner.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom. Penny and Leonard are in bed.\nLeonard: This is actually gonna happen.\nPenny: Honey, shush, shush, shush, shush, shush.\nLeonard: You shush, I\xe2\x80\x99m happy, I want to talk about it. You know what my mother would say about this? She would say because you were not loved by your father and I was not loved by my mother, that having sex is our way of making up for the intimacy we didn\xe2\x80\x99t get as children.\nPenny: Why would you bring that up right now?\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Foreplay?\nPenny: So you\xe2\x80\x99re saying you\xe2\x80\x99re not having sex with me, you\xe2\x80\x99re having sex with your mother?\nLeonard: Ummm, I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna go with \xe2\x80\x9cno.\xe2\x80\x9d\nPenny: That is the sickest thing I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever heard.\nLeonard: Come on, you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to have sex with your father, and I\xe2\x80\x99m okay with that.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s front door.\n  Penny: Get out!\nLeonard: She said shush. I should have shushed. (Enters apartment. Sheldon and Beverley are inside duetting on Journey\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cAny Way You Want It\xe2\x80\x9d on Rock Star.)\n  Scene: The hallway.\nLeonard: All right, Mother. Um, have a nice flight.\nBeverley: That\xe2\x80\x99s not really in my control, is it? Oh, uh, yes (gives him a very uncomfortable hug.)\nPenny (coming out of her apartment): Oh, good morning.\nLeonard: Morning.\nPenny: Look, I was just coming over to talk to you.\nLeonard: You don\xe2\x80\x99t have to. Ever.\nPenny: Gotcha.\nLeonard: Good-bye, Mother.\nBeverley: Good-bye, Leonard. So, Slugger, shall we pick up where we left off last time?\nSlight time shift.\n  Penny (in tears): I mean, my mom could\xe2\x80\x99ve just said, \xe2\x80\x9cBob, get over it, she\xe2\x80\x99s a girl, move on.\xe2\x80\x9d But she didn\xe2\x80\x99t. Not one word.\nBeverley: Interesting. Would you be willing to fly to New Jersey and discuss your relationship with your parents during a brain scan?\nPenny: Would it help?\nBeverley: Well, it would help me.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
