b'Scene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Leonard, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been working on an opening joke for our lecture at Berkeley.\nLeonard: Oh, I like to laugh. But say it anyway.\nSheldon: Okay, um, what do you say to a graduate of the UC Berkeley physics department? I\xe2\x80\x99ll have fries with that. Because his education hasn\xe2\x80\x99t prepared him for a career in the sciences.\nPenny: You know, when they chase you out of there, you only have to run faster than Sheldon.\nAmy: Are you all set for your trip?\nSheldon: Yeah, I think so. I just restocked the old PRK.\nPenny: PRK?\nLeonard: Public restroom kit. Everything a boy needs for making pee pee in new and strange places.\nSheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t see what\xe2\x80\x99s crazy about bringing a backpack with your own toilet paper and Purell.\nLeonard: Keep going.\nSheldon: And rubber gloves, uh, air freshener. Um, noise-cancelling headphones. Oh, danger whistle. Um, pepper spray. Ooh, a multi-language occupied sign. Uh, let\xe2\x80\x99s see, we have seat protectors, uh, booties for my shoes, a clothespin for my nose. Oh, and a mirror on a stick, so I can make sure the person in the stall next to me isn\xe2\x80\x99t some kind of weirdo.\nPenny: You still worried some Berkeley girl is gonna steal him away?\nAmy: Yes, who do you think gave him the danger whistle?\nCredits sequence.\nScene: Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s car.\nSheldon: Would you like to play a physics car game I invented called I Can\xe2\x80\x99t Spy? It\xe2\x80\x99s all the nail-biting tension of I Spy but the added fun of subatomic particles and waves outside the visible spectrum.\nLeonard: If it\xe2\x80\x99s half as much fun as One Times Ten to the Fourth Bottles of Beer on the Wall, I\xe2\x80\x99m in.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99ll begin. Uh, I can\xe2\x80\x99t spy with my little eye something passing right through us.\nLeonard: That soy Frappuccino I had.\nSheldon: Will you please play the game? I can\xe2\x80\x99t spy with my little eye something passing right through us.\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, um, if 65 billion solar neutrinos pass through a square centimetre every second, given the surface area of this car is about 60,000 square centimetres, that means 3.9 times ten to the 15th solar neutrinos?\nSheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to play anymore.\nLeonard: We haven\xe2\x80\x99t been on a road trip in a while. This is fun.\nSheldon: We get it, you won the game. Stop bragging.\nLeonard: No, listen, we wrote a paper together. Now we get to go to a university and talk about it? That\xe2\x80\x99s pretty cool.\nSheldon: I suppose it is. In fact, if you\xe2\x80\x99d like to celebrate with a little music, I\xe2\x80\x99d be okay with that.\nLeonard: What? This road trip just got crazy.\nSheldon: Play that funky music, white boy.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m surprised you know that reference.\nSheldon: What reference?\nScene: Mrs Wolowitz\xe2\x80\x99s house.\nBernadette: So, I put stickers on everything we\xe2\x80\x99re gonna sell. We just need help taking it all out to the driveway.\nAmy: Can I be in charge of pricing? I\xe2\x80\x99ve been going to garage sales my whole life. Can you believe I got these pantyhose for a nickel?\nHoward: All right, Amy\xe2\x80\x99s in charge of pricing and being 75.\nRaj: Hey, Penny, can you give me a hand with this?\nPenny: Sure. Oh, we had one of these growing up. I used to play all the time.\nRaj: Oh, yeah? I love Ping-Pong.\nPenny: Oh, I meant beer pong.\nAmy: I had a table, too, but I didn\xe2\x80\x99t have any friends, so all I did was serve.\nBernadette: You know, you can leave one side up and play against it.\nAmy: And if I had a friend, they might have told me that.\nHoward: Excuse me. Why is there a sticker on this? It\xe2\x80\x99s my TARDIS from Doctor Who. I was planning on moving it in the house.\nBernadette: I think you just answered your own question.\nHoward: Come on, one day, this may double in value and be worth half what I paid for it.\nBernadette: Sweetie, we have a lot to do. We don\xe2\x80\x99t need to decide this right now.\nHoward: Well, I guess as long as you\xe2\x80\x99re keeping an open mind.\nBernadette: Of course.\nScene: Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s car. \xe2\x80\x9cPlay that funky music, white boy\xe2\x80\x9d is playing on the stereo.\nSheldon: So they\xe2\x80\x99re requesting that the white boy play the funky music, yes?\nLeonard: Yes.\nSheldon: And this music we\xe2\x80\x99re listening to right now is funky as well?\nLeonard: Sure.\nSheldon: Let me ask you this. Do you think this song is the music the white boy ultimately plays?\nLeonard: It could be.\nSheldon: So it\xe2\x80\x99s like the musical equivalent of Russell\xe2\x80\x99s Paradox, the question of whether the set of all sets that don\xe2\x80\x99t contain themselves as members contains itself?\nLeonard: Exactly.\nSheldon: Well then I hate it. Music should just be fun.\nLeonard: Making great time. Gonna be there pretty early.\nSheldon: Will our hotel room be ready?\nLeonard: I doubt it.\nSheldon: Aren\xe2\x80\x99t you worried that sitting in the lobby for a long period of time might attract the attention of the hotel detective?\nLeonard: If we do, we\xe2\x80\x99ll just tell him to hit the bricks, see?\nSheldon: Seems a little confrontational, but all right. You know, we won\xe2\x80\x99t be very far from Skywalker Ranch.\nLeonard: Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s true. It\xe2\x80\x99s not like we can get in there.\nSheldon: Why not?\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t think George Lucas put his headquarters in the middle of nowhere because he wanted people dropping in.\nSheldon: Yoda\xe2\x80\x99s swamp was in the middle of nowhere. Tatooine was in the middle of nowhere. Hoth was in the middle of nowhere. That\xe2\x80\x99s code, Leonard. He wants us to drop in.\nLeonard: We do have time. I mean, we could drive by and just look at it.\nSheldon: Yes. Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m so excited. And I just can\xe2\x80\x99t hide it.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m about to lose control, and I think I like it.\nSheldon: What are you talking about?\nScene: Mrs Wolowitz\xe2\x80\x99s house.\nPenny: So when do you guys think you\xe2\x80\x99re gonna move in?\nHoward: We\xe2\x80\x99re still figuring how much remodeling we want to do.\nBernadette: It\xe2\x80\x99s tricky finding the right balance between tasteful modern and Jewish mother tchotchke crapfest.\nAmy: Have you made a decision about the TARDIS? I think I can sell it if we call it Big British Porta-Potty.\nHoward: We\xe2\x80\x99re not selling it, it\xe2\x80\x99s mine.\nBernadette: You can\xe2\x80\x99t just decide. How about I arm-wrestle you?\nHoward: That\xe2\x80\x99s not fair. It\xe2\x80\x99s like me challenging you to a sexy pants contest.\nRaj: You could play Ping-Pong for it.\nHoward: I would do that.\nBernadette: How is that fair? You grew up with a table.\nHoward: Yes, but I mostly used it as a battlefield in an ongoing war between the Transformers and the ThunderCats for control of a bra I had found in the woods.\nPenny: Bernadette, for every episode of Doctor Who Leonard has made me sit through, I will play on your behalf and send that TARDIS back to Gallifrey, where I hate that I know it belongs.\nBernadette: Yes, Penny plays for me.\nHoward: That\xe2\x80\x99s not fair, she has upper body muscles.\nRaj: Dude, three-time Sanskriti School for Well-Born Boys badminton champion.\nHoward: That\xe2\x80\x99s right, okay, Raj can play for me.\nAmy: Ooh, you just chose champions. It\xe2\x80\x99s like we\xe2\x80\x99re re-enacting the ancient German practice of trial by combat.\nPenny: Yeah, it\xe2\x80\x99s also like when the Mountain fought the Red Viper in Game of Thrones.\nBernadette: Leonard makes you watch that, too?\nPenny: No, no, I like that show. It\xe2\x80\x99s got dragons and people doing it.\nHoward: So it\xe2\x80\x99s settled. The fate of Doctor Who\xe2\x80\x99s TARDIS will be decided by a Game of Thrones inspired death-match on the battlefield of ThunderCats versus Transformers.\nAmy: If you still have that bra, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you a nickel for it.\nScene: Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s car.\nSheldon: There it is. It\xe2\x80\x99s just a gate. On a road.\nLeonard: Wasn\xe2\x80\x99t even that hard to find.\nSheldon: This is so amazing.\nLeonard: I know. You want to get a picture?\nSheldon: I want more than a picture. I want to go in.\nLeonard: Well, so do I, but they\xe2\x80\x99ll never let us.\nSheldon: Is that the attitude that helped you get Penny?\nLeonard: No, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t have three years to make that gate feel sorry for me.\nSheldon: There\xe2\x80\x99s a speaker box. Drive up, push the button, and let\xe2\x80\x99s see what happens.\nLeonard: Okay, yeah. What do we have to lose? I\xe2\x80\x99m a little nervous.\nSheldon: Well, get over it. Confidence is key in these situations.\nLeonard: Right.\nSheldon: You pushed it, are you out of your mind?\nVoice: May I help you?\nLeonard: Um, uh, uh, uh, we don\xe2\x80\x99t have an appointment, and, and we don\xe2\x80\x99t belong here, but we, we\xe2\x80\x99re, like, crazy-big fans. I mean uh, buh, buh, crazy for Star Wars crazy, not crazy like we have a backpack full of duct tape, although we do have a backpack that you really don\xe2\x80\x99t want to look in.\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re blowing it. We want to meet George Lucas and become his friends and play with him.\nVoice: Hello? This speaker\xe2\x80\x99s not working, just pull up.\nLeonard: And that\xe2\x80\x99s how it\xe2\x80\x99s done.\nScene: The same, further inside the ranch.\nSheldon: All right, we\xe2\x80\x99ve defeated the first challenge. Now we must steel ourselves to face the monster who defends the gate.\nLeonard: We\xe2\x80\x99re trying to get past a security guard, not rescue Zelda.\nSheldon: I think what really needs to be rescued is your sense of whimsy, but one quest at a time. So what\xe2\x80\x99s the plan?\nLeonard: Uh, I\xe2\x80\x99m just gonna be honest with the guy.\nSheldon: Honesty will never get us in.\nLeonard: Well, what\xe2\x80\x99s your plan?\nSheldon: All right, my plan is predicated on the assumption that they have a nurse\xe2\x80\x99s office and your willingness to be lightly stabbed.\nSecurity Guard: Who are you here to see?\nLeonard: Uh, I\xe2\x80\x99m just gonna tell you the truth.\nSheldon: Oh, you are killing me.\nLeonard: We don\xe2\x80\x99t have an appointment. We, we\xe2\x80\x99re just fans of Mr. Lucas\xe2\x80\x99s work, and we thought we\xe2\x80\x99d take a shot and see if we could get in and look around.\nSecurity Guard: Sorry, guys, we get this a lot. Can\xe2\x80\x99t let you in.\nSheldon: What if I told you that I was the voice of Yoda? A recording session I must attend.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, don\xe2\x80\x99t listen to him. We\xe2\x80\x99re actually physicists. We\xe2\x80\x99re giving a lecture at Berkeley later today. We just, we had some time to kill.\nSecurity Guard: Hey, listen, you seem like decent guys. I can\xe2\x80\x99t let you in, but I got some hats and T-shirts I can give you.\nLeonard: Thank you so much. See? Maybe honesty is the best\xe2\x80\xa6 What are you doing?\nSheldon: Shedding the yoke of my oppressors, you blind, sad little man.\nSecurity Guard: Don\xe2\x80\x99t move. Code A-A-23, A-A-23.\nVoice: Copy.\nSheldon: I can see the ranch, Leonard. Oh, it\xe2\x80\x99s rustic, it\xe2\x80\x99s lovely. I\xe2\x80\x99d take a picture, but people are chasing me. I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna make it. I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna make it. They have Tasers, but they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t dare use\xe2\x80\xa6 Aaaaaaagh!\nScene: Mrs Wolowitz\xe2\x80\x99s house.\nHoward: Come on, Raj. You are the King Kong of Ping-Pong. You are the menace of table tennis. Put her away, \xe2\x80\x99cause I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a third one. Yes. Woo.\nAmy: Rajesh eight, Penny four.\nPenny: Sorry, he\xe2\x80\x99s really good.\nBernadette: Hey, Raj. if Howard can\xe2\x80\x99t keep the TARDIS, how great would it look at your place?\nRaj: What?\nHoward: Yeah, what?\nBernadette: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know much about Doctor Who, but if, um, you were to put this right outside your front door and open up the back, it would be like your entire apartment was the inside of the TARDIS, which is pretty cool \xe2\x80\x99cause on the show, the inside of the TARDIS is bigger than the outside. But then again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know much about<i> Doctor Who.\nHoward: Don\xe2\x80\x99t listen to her. You and I go way back, we\xe2\x80\x99re like brothers.\nRaj: We are. We are. Oh, no. What a terrible serve. Sorry, brother.\nAmy: Eight-five.\nHoward: This is ridiculous. I want a new champion. Amy, were you serious about being able to serve?\nAmy: Uh, it, it\xe2\x80\x99s been a long time. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I\xe2\x80\x99m probably pretty rusty.\nPenny: Wow.\nHoward: She\xe2\x80\x99s my champion.\nBernadette: Well, if you can switch champions, so can I. I want Raj.\nPenny: Hey.\nBernadette: Oh, come on, like you even care.\nPenny: I care. Oh, wait, no, I don\xe2\x80\x99t. Good luck, Raj.\nHoward: You know, I thought our friendship meant more to you.\nRaj: So did I.\nScene: An office in Skywalker Ranch.\nSheldon: Do you think they\xe2\x80\x99re gonna call the police?\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Maybe they\xe2\x80\x99ll call Imperial Officers to take us to a holding cell on the Death Star.\nSheldon: Oh, I think that\xe2\x80\x99s below the pay grade of an Imperial Officer. Stormtroopers are really the ones who\xe2\x80\xa6\nLeonard: Oh, shut up.\nNerdy Guy: He\xe2\x80\x99s right. Uh, Stormtroopers actually combine both the function of infantry and military police.\n  Leonard: Uh-huh, I\xe2\x80\x99m normally very nice, but you shut up, too.\nSheldon: So, what are you in for?\nNerdy Guy: Honestly, I just wanted to meet Mr. Lucas and say thank you. You know, growing up, the movies had such an impact on my life. I never really fit in anywhere. Till I discovered the worlds he created and finally found a place where I belong.\nSheldon: But why are you here?\nNerdy Guy: Oh, I, uh, I hopped a fence, and they caught me in the sculpture gallery making out with a Chewbacca statue.\nSheldon: Excuse me. Leonard, they have a sculpture gallery.\nSecurity Guard: All right, I talked to my supervisor, and we\xe2\x80\x99re gonna let you go with a warning. But if you ever come back, we will call the police and press charges.\nLeonard: We understand. Thank you so much.\nNerdy Guy: Uh, what about me?\nSecurity Guard: No, you\xe2\x80\x99re not going anywhere, kissy face. Let\xe2\x80\x99s go. I have to take your picture to post at the guard gate.\nSheldon: Uh, one question about that picture. Can it be with George Lucas? Ooh, grumpy you are.\nScene: Mrs Wolowitz\xe2\x80\x99s house.\nHoward: Okay, this is the match that decides it all. First to 11 wins. Serve switches every five points. And just so you know, when this started, I was going to put the TARDIS in a discreet corner of the house, but I\xe2\x80\x99ve since turned mean, and now it\xe2\x80\x99s going right in the middle of the living room on a rotating platform with a sign that says suck it. Game on.\nBernadette: Except, Raj is gonna win. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that right, Raj?\nRaj: Uh, yeah, I mean, her serve was pretty good.\nBernadette: Come on, get in her head. Be intimidating.\nRaj: Okay, uh, I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna own you, bitch.\nPenny: Whoa.\nBernadette: Hey.\nAmy: That\xe2\x80\x99s not nice.\nRaj: Let\xe2\x80\x99s just play.\nHoward: One-zero. Two. Three. Four. Five-nothing. Wait, did you play badminton or sad-minton?\nBernadette: Don\xe2\x80\x99t listen to him, all she\xe2\x80\x99s got is a serve. Now, grab a fresh tampon and put her away.\nRaj: What, and that\xe2\x80\x99s not offensive? Where\xe2\x80\x99s the line?\nPenny: It\xe2\x80\x99s in your purse. Play.\nBernadette: One-five. Two-five. Three-five. Four-five. Five-five.\nHoward: Six. Seven. Eight. Nine. Ten-five.\nBernadette: Six. Seven. Eight. Nine. Ten-ten.\nAmy: Well, that was an exciting 40 seconds.\nHoward: It was, and now the serve is back to you, and the game is over.\nBernadette: You know, Amy, I, uh, can\xe2\x80\x99t help but wonder how Sheldon would react if the TARDIS was at your place.\nHoward: Don\xe2\x80\x99t listen to her, just hit the ball.\nAmy: Keep talking.\nScene: Amy\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nBernadette: If this doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get him into your bedroom, nothing will.\nScene: The stairwell.\nSheldon: Are you still mad at me?\nLeonard: Yes, we missed our lecture, we were almost arrested, and you got me locked in a room with a man who forced his tongue down the throat of a stuffed Wookiee.\nSheldon: Boy, some people are just glass-half-empty.\nLeonard: The glass is empty, Sheldon. It\xe2\x80\x99s completely empty. If you gave that glass to a man who was dying of thirst, he would be dead, do you know why?\nSheldon: Before I answer, was he a smoker? I think you\xe2\x80\x99re looking at this all wrong.\nLeonard: Fine, then tell me how I should be looking at it.\nSheldon: Well, not only did we go to Skywalker Ranch, we got in. And no one we know can say that. And for all the times you find me irritating, today you got to watch someone shoot me with a Taser.\nLeonard: That part was pretty good.\nSheldon: See?\nLeonard: You did flop around a lot.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99ll take your word for it. I was too busy trying not to defecate.\nLeonard: You know, when they were escorting us to the detaining room, I looked through a door, and I\xe2\x80\x99m pretty sure I saw a display case with the Ark of the Covenant.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s amazing.\nLeonard: I know.\nSheldon: And I saw Jabba the Hutt riding by on a motorcycle. Although that was right after the Tasing, so who can say for sure?\nLeonard: I guess this could count as an adventure.\nSheldon: It was. And even though we\xe2\x80\x99re not allowed back there, they can never take today away from us. Unlike my sense of smell, which hasn\xe2\x80\x99t returned since the Tasing. No, I got nothing.\nScene: Amy\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom.\nSheldon: Amy, the Daleks are right on my tail, quick, we need to reset the time circuits. Oh, no, I left my sonic screwdriver behind.\nAmy: Really should have thought this through.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
