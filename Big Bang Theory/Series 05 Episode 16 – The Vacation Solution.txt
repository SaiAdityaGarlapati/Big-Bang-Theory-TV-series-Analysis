b'Scene: The cafeteria.\nSheldon: Gentlemen, I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve come up with a fun way to get young people interested in science. Physics Mad-Libs. Now, give me a number.\nLeonard: Five.\nSheldon: Uh-huh. And an irrational constant.\nHoward: E.\nSheldon: And a funny Greek letter.\nRaj: Gamma.\nSheldon: I said funny.\nRaj: Upsilon?\nSheldon: Good one. And an electrical charge.\nLeonard: Positive.\nSheldon: Ha. Perfect. Okay. Get this. Professor Jones told the symposium he had a new method for calculating the mass of a muon. Five times the limit of E to the upsilon as in a (laughs uncontrollably). Okay. No, no. I\xe2\x80\x99ll start over. Professor (laughs again)\nHoward: I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen him laugh that hard since the day Leonard made that multiplication error.\nSheldon: Oh, Oh, Lord, that multiplication error! He thought he carried the one. But he didn\xe2\x80\x99t.\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s not funny. That mistake got published.\nSheldon: Stop! I\xe2\x80\x99m going to wet myself!\nRaj: Hey, guys, guys, President Siebert is headed this way.\nHoward: I wonder what he wants.\nLeonard: Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t look happy, so I\xe2\x80\x99m guessing he wants to talk to Sheldon.\nSeibert: Dr. Cooper?\nLeonard: Told ya.\nSheldon: Oh, President Siebert, I assume you\xe2\x80\x99d like to respond to one of the suggestions I put in the box by your office.\nSeibert: No, and stop installing suggestion boxes everywhere.\nSheldon: You don\xe2\x80\x99t like written suggestions. You don\xe2\x80\x99t like when I give them to you while we\xe2\x80\x99re urinating in the men\xe2\x80\x99s room. If I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know any better, I\xe2\x80\x99d say that you\xe2\x80\x99re one of those stubborn people who are not open to suggestions.\nSeibert: Dr. Cooper, the physics department chair tells me you\xe2\x80\x99re refusing to take your vacation.\nSheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t need a vacation.\nSeibert: You\xe2\x80\x99re obligated to take one. And I\xe2\x80\x99d also like you to know the most-often received suggestion in my suggestion box you installed without asking me is can Dr. Cooper take a vacation? Okay, settled, then. I\xe2\x80\x99ll see you all on Monday, except for you.\nSheldon: But if I don\xe2\x80\x99t come into work, what am I supposed to do with myself?\nSeibert: Read, rest, travel. I hear Afghanistan is nice this time of year.\nSheldon: Sarcasm?\nHoward: No. You should go.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s car. Leonard is singing enthusiastically.\nLeonard: That tonight\xe2\x80\x99s gonna be a good night, and tonight\xe2\x80\x99s gonna be a good night, and tonight\xe2\x80\x99s gonna be a good, good night! Tonight\xe2\x80\x99s the night, uh, uh, let\xe2\x80\x99s live it up, uh, I got my money, let\xe2\x80\x99s spend it up\xe2\x80\xa6\nSheldon (appearing in the back seat): Good Lord! Would you stop that caterwauling!\nLeonard: What the hell are you doing?\nSheldon: Bleeding from my ears.\nLeonard: What are you doing hiding back there?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m sneaking into work. Now, if the guard at the university asks what\xe2\x80\x99s under the blanket, you tell him it\xe2\x80\x99s some lobster traps.\nLeonard: Lobster traps?\nSheldon: Yes. That\xe2\x80\x99s how Velma and Scooby smuggled Shaggy into the old lighthouse.\nLeonard: What are you going to do when you get to the university? People are going to recognize you.\nSheldon: Will they, Leonard? (Puts on cap and long-hair wig)\nLeonard: Fine. Just get back under your blanket, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll drive you there.\nSheldon: And no more singing.\nLeonard: Fine.\nSheldon: I have GPS on my phone. I know you turned around.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nPenny: I\xe2\x80\x99m so glad you talked Howard out of having your wedding invitations in Klingon.\nBernadette: Turn it over. I\xe2\x80\x99m hoping my relatives think it\xe2\x80\x99s Hebrew.\nAmy: This is really happening. I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna be a maid of honour. I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna wear a beautiful dress and walk down that aisle and, finally, I will have my special day.\nBernadette: You mean my special day?\nAmy: They\xe2\x80\x99re gonna need an extra-large veil for somebody\xe2\x80\x99s head.\nBernadette: If I ever actually ever get married.\nPenny: Why wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you?\nBernadette: My dad. Because I make a lot more money than Howie, he\xe2\x80\x99s putting a lot of pressure on me to get a pre-nup.\nPenny: Ouch.\nBernadette: Yeah. Howie\xe2\x80\x99s gonna freak out.\nAmy: Parental pressure can be daunting. I remember the battle with my mother about shaving my legs. Last year, I finally gave in and let her do it.\nBernadette: I just don\xe2\x80\x99t know how I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna break it to him.\nPenny: You know, I\xe2\x80\x99m a big believer in breaking bad news to a guy when you\xe2\x80\x99re in bed with him. That\xe2\x80\x99s how I told my high school boyfriend I slept with his brother. That\xe2\x80\x99s how I told his brother the same thing.\nBernadette: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to manipulate him with sex.\nPenny: Oh, sweetie, that\xe2\x80\x99s what sex is for.\nAmy: You know, the connection between marriage and money is nothing new. In fact, the term wed referred to the money and livestock that the groom paid the bride\xe2\x80\x99s father. For example, you\xe2\x80\x99re adorable, intelligent and a good earner. I could conservatively see you going for at least two oxen and a goose. (To Penny) You would fetch a unicorn.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: Sheldon, there are a million great vacations you could take. What about Hawaii?\nSheldon: Hawaii is a former leper colony on top of an active volcano where the disappointing ending to Lost was filmed. Mahalo for nothing, Hawaii.\nHoward: How about Florida? They\xe2\x80\x99ve got Cape Canaveral, they\xe2\x80\x99ve got Disney, they\xe2\x80\x99ve got my Aunt Ida and the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest collection of diabetic candy. Plus, if you get sweaty enough, her plastic-covered furniture is like a flume ride.\nSheldon: My family took a trip to Florida when I was a child. A seagull stole a hot dog from me on the beach. I got the message.\nRaj: You know, if I had a week off, I\xe2\x80\x99d go back to the Two Bunch Palms Resort and Spa in the desert. I tell you, an hour on the massage table with Trevor, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll feel like you were born without bones.\nHoward: I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I could ever let a guy give me a massage.\nRaj: Really? What was I doing to your neck last night while you were playing X-Box?\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s like I\xe2\x80\x99m living in a dictatorship. You must take a vacation, you must have fun, you must enjoy life.\nHoward: I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you have a good handle on dictatorships.\nLeonard: Sheldon, everybody takes vacations.\nSheldon: One time they tried to make Richard Feynman take a vacation, but he chose instead to expand his mind and learn something new. He went to work in his friend\xe2\x80\x99s biology lab. Richard Feynman was a famous American physicist, part of the Manhattan Project.\nHoward: Everyone in the world of science knows who Richard Feynman was.\nSheldon: Now you do, too. Oh! I have a brilliant idea. Amy\xe2\x80\x99s a biologist. I\xe2\x80\x99ll go work in her lab.\nHoward: Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that just Feynman\xe2\x80\x99s idea?\nSheldon: Ten seconds ago, you never heard of him. Now you\xe2\x80\x99re an expert.\nScene: The hallway.\nLeonard: Hey.\nPenny: Hey, you.\nLeonard: Is that your laundry? You only have, like, six things in there.\nPenny: Yeah, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t have any quarters, so I\xe2\x80\x99ve been sneaking stuff into other people\xe2\x80\x99s loads all day. Hey, if I tell you something, will you promise not to tell anybody?\nLeonard: It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter what I say, you\xe2\x80\x99re gonna tell me anyway.\nPenny: What? That is not true. Bernadette wants a pre-nup.\nLeonard: Wow. That\xe2\x80\x99s rough.\nPenny: So you\xe2\x80\x99re saying if I became a famous movie star, we got married, you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t sign a pre-nup?\nLeonard: Absolutely not. If I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna be stuck at home with the kids while you\xe2\x80\x99re on location cheating on me with Ryan Gosling, then Leonard gots to get paid. So, you think about us getting married?\nPenny: I think about a lot of things. I think about us getting married, I think about us breaking up. Once in a while, I think about how I didn\xe2\x80\x99t leave a note on that Mercedes I dinged in the parking lot last month, but then I have a glass of wine and it passes.\nLeonard: Joke all you want, but you think about it.\nPenny: Well, tell you one thing, if I ever do get married, no Klingon invitations.\nLeonard: Good luck catching a man with that attitude.\nScene: Amy\xe2\x80\x99s laboratory.\nSheldon: Boy, oh, boy. This vacation is off to a wonderful start. The smell of formaldehyde, the whir of the centrifuge, the distant chatter of lab animals being dispatched for dissection. Mm, I can already feel my cares just melting away.\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99m excited to work with my boyfriend. It\xe2\x80\x99s gonna be romantic.\nSheldon: Way to kill the mood.\nAmy: Come on, Sheldon. We can be like Marie Curie and her husband, Pierre, who spent their days working side by side, bathed in the glow of their love and the radium that ultimately killed her. Screw Beauty and the Beast, that\xe2\x80\x99s the love story Disney should tell.\nSheldon: Okay, what do we start with? Maybe splicing some genes, clone a sheep, perhaps grow a human ear on a mouse\xe2\x80\x99s back? Ha-ha, I\xe2\x80\x99m a freak!\nAmy: Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna be doing some brain stem histology while you put yourself on the business end of a sponge and wash those beakers.\nSheldon: Wash those bea\xe2\x80\xa6 Oh, I get it, a little hazing for the new fella. Yeah, I\xe2\x80\x99d better keep and eye out for, what, shoe polish on the microscope, or mad cow disease in my grilled cheese sandwich?\nAmy: No, I just need those beakers washed. Hippity-hop, quick like a bunny.\nSheldon: What? Excuse me, you have Dr. Sheldon Cooper in your lab. You\xe2\x80\x99re gonna make him do the dishes? That\xe2\x80\x99s like asking the Incredible Hulk to open a pickle jar.\nAmy: Sheldon, you\xe2\x80\x99ve never worked in a lab like this before. You have no experience in the field of biology.\nSheldon: I have plenty of experience in biology. I bought a Tamagotchi in 1998. And it\xe2\x80\x99s still alive. Let\xe2\x80\x99s do this.\nScene: The cafeteria.\nLeonard: Where\xe2\x80\x99s Howard?\nRaj: No hi, Raj? No how are you, Raj? Just straight to where\xe2\x80\x99s the other white guy?\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. So, listen, I heard something about him. Can you keep it between us?\nRaj: Ooh, gossip. When I first got here, I thought you Americans really gossiped around the water cooler. So I hung out there for, like, a month, but the only gossip I ever heard was about some creepy guy hanging out by the water cooler.\nLeonard: Bernadette wants to get a pre-nup.\nRaj: Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s a shame, he\xe2\x80\x99s gonna be devastated.\nLeonard: I never know what to do in these situations. Should I give him a heads-up?\nRaj: Hmm. I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna give you the same advice I yell at the TV when the Bachelor\xe2\x80\x99s handing out roses. Follow your heart.\nHoward: Check it out. Look at the size of that Rice Krispie Treat. Same price.\nLeonard: Hey, Howard, I need to tell you something.\nHoward: I know, it\xe2\x80\x99s not on my wedding diet. I don\xe2\x80\x99t care.\nLeonard: Uh, listen, I heard that Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s thinking about asking you for a pre-nup.\nHoward: A pre-nup? Wow.\nLeonard: What are you gonna do?\nHoward: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\nRaj: Follow your heart.\nHoward: You know what, it\xe2\x80\x99s not a big deal. She makes more money than me. She wants to protect her financial interests. It\xe2\x80\x99s completely reasonable.\nLeonard; Good. That\xe2\x80\x99s a healthy attitude.\nHoward: Yeah, actually, it\xe2\x80\x99s good for both of us. I have assets to protect, too.\nRaj: Like what?\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99ve got some rare comic books. The Vespa\xe2\x80\x99s almost paid off. And Ma and I have a primo double cemetery plot at Mt. Sinai right near the guy who played Mr. Roper on Three\xe2\x80\x99s Company.\nRaj: Mr. Roper\xe2\x80\x99s dead? You can\xe2\x80\x99t just spring that on a guy.\nScene: Amy\xe2\x80\x99s laboratory.\nSheldon: Here you go. This is now the only lab with glassware washed by a man with two doctorates and a restraining order signed by Carl Sagan.\nAmy: Soap spots. Wash \xe2\x80\x99em again.\nSheldon: Y-you\xe2\x80\x99re being ridiculous. Those are perfectly clean.\nAmy: Sheldon, this beaker used to contain cerebral spinal fluid from an elephant that died of syphilis. If it\xe2\x80\x99s, in fact, perfectly clean, drink from it.\nSheldon: Biologists are mean.\nLater.\nAmy: All right, perhaps this task will be a little bit more up your alley. I need you to count the bacteria spores on these petri dishes.\nSheldon: There was something wrong with that detergent. That was way too bubbly.\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99m sure it was.\nSheldon: I intend to write that soap company a strongly worded letter.\nAmy: Yeah, good for you. Now, start counting.\nSheldon: You know what this place needs? A suggestion box.\nLater.\nSheldon: 366\xe2\x80\xa6 367\xe2\x80\xa6\nAmy: How\xe2\x80\x99s it going?\nSheldon: How\xe2\x80\x99s counting going? When I was in kindergarten, I recited pi to a thousand places for the school talent show. I think I got this.\nAmy: Great.\nSheldon: Aw, nuts! One\xe2\x80\xa6\nLater.\nSheldon: This is preposterous. I think you\xe2\x80\x99re giving me these tasks because you\xe2\x80\x99re afraid if you give me anything meaningful to do, I\xe2\x80\x99ll show you up.\nAmy: Really? Is that what you think?\nSheldon: Yes, that\xe2\x80\x99s what I think. And I\xe2\x80\x99m super smart, so it\xe2\x80\x99s probably true.\nAmy: Hey, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been training in the field of neurobiology for 12 years. You\xe2\x80\x99ve been here for three hours, and you\xe2\x80\x99ve spent one of them in the bathroom.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. It takes me a while to get things going on an unfamiliar toilet.\nAmy: Sheldon, I\xe2\x80\x99ve given you the simplest things to do, and you haven\xe2\x80\x99t done one of them right.\nSheldon: Maybe that\xe2\x80\x99s because I\xe2\x80\x99m not being challenged. It\xe2\x80\x99s the same reason Einstein failed math.\nAmy: Maybe the math was too bubbly for him.\nSheldon: You think you\xe2\x80\x99re doing science by cutting up that brain? They could do the same thing at any Quiznos. And they\xe2\x80\x99d offer to toast it for me, too.\nAmy: Okay, smart guy. I\xe2\x80\x99m about to remove the locus coeruleus, which is incredibly delicate work. Have at it.\nSheldon: All right. I\xe2\x80\x99m no stranger to a little gray matter. Locus coeruleus. Locus coeruleus.\nAmy: You\xe2\x80\x99re getting warmer, it is, indeed, in the brain. Hope your hands are steady. It\xe2\x80\x99s the width of a single hair. But this is just biology, so I\xe2\x80\x99m sure it\xe2\x80\x99s no problem for a genius like you.\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s not. I\xe2\x80\x99ll have you know, in the field of physics, we work with particles so small, they make fat jokes about the locus coeruleus, i.e., when your locus coeruleus sits around the house, it sits around the house.\nAmy: Oh, are we nervous, Dr. Cooper?\nSheldon: No. What you see is a man trembling with confidence. Does a locus coeruleus normally bleed that much?\nAmy: No. But your thumb does.\nSheldon: Oh, dear. (Faints)\nAmy: Yeah, you\xe2\x80\x99re a biologist.\nScene: The bar at the Cheesecake Factory.\nHoward: What are you doing here?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m on vacation. Social convention dictates that I let my hair down at a local watering hole. Social convention is stupid.\nHoward: What happened to your thumb?\nSheldon: You know, I have ten fingers and ten toes. If I tell you a story about each one of them, we\xe2\x80\x99ll be here all day, let\xe2\x80\x99s just move on.\nBarman: What can I get you?\nSheldon: Ah, seeing as I\xe2\x80\x99m on vacation, a pina colada seems appropriate. Extra pineapple slices, extra whipped cream, extra cherries, extra umbrellas, and, uh, hold the rum. Don\xe2\x80\x99t let me have too many of those.\nPenny: Hey, what are you guys doing here?\nHoward: We\xe2\x80\x99re grown men, we drink at bars.\nPenny: No and no. Everything okay with you and Bernadette?\nHoward: Oh, yeah, sure.\nPenny: You and Amy? Good?\nSheldon: Oh, better than good.\nPenny: You know those girls text me every detail of their lives as it happens.\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m not signing a pre-nup.\nPenny: All right, Howard Wolowitz, listen up. You sign anything she puts in front of you, because you are the luckiest man alive. If you let her go, there is no way you can find anyone else. Speaking on behalf of all women, it is not gonna happen, we had a meeting. And you, a grown man fainting at the sight of a little blood.\nSheldon: Excuse me, this is a fairly substantial wound. (Removes plaster. Faints again)\nScene: Amy\xe2\x80\x99s laboratory.\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Amy? (Knock, knock, knock) Amy? (Knock, knock, knock) Amy?\nAmy: What do you want?\nSheldon: I was kind of hoping I could continue vacationing in your laboratory. After all, I did book the whole week.\nAmy: Do you honestly think you can just waltz back in here after the way you behaved yesterday?\nSheldon: I was not myself. I had lost a lot of thumb blood.\nAmy: That\xe2\x80\x99s not an apology.\nSheldon: That is your opinion.\nAmy: I want a real apology.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry that you weren\xe2\x80\x99t able to\xe2\x80\xa6\nAmy: No.\nSheldon: That my genius\xe2\x80\xa6\nAmy: No.\nSheldon: That the soap was\xe2\x80\xa6\nAmy: Sheldon.\nSheldon: Fine. Sorry.\nAmy: You\xe2\x80\x99re forgiven. Now, if you want to stay, get started on those beakers. They\xe2\x80\x99re still dirty from yesterday.\nSheldon: Next year I\xe2\x80\x99m going to Epcot.\nScene: Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s car.\nBernadette: Are you mad at me?\nHoward: No. I\xe2\x80\x99m not mad at you. I just wish you would have come to me, so I didn\xe2\x80\x99t have to hear it through the nerd-vine.\nBernadette: So, what are we gonna do?\nHoward: You really want me to sign a pre-nup?\nBernadette: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. My dad\xe2\x80\x99s pretty insistent on it, though.\nHoward: Why don\xe2\x80\x99t I talk to your dad, man-to-man?\nBernadette: Really? Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99d be so great.\nHoward: Done.\nBernadette: I should probably give you a heads-up about a couple of things. Even though he\xe2\x80\x99s retired from the police force, he still carries his gun. But don\xe2\x80\x99t worry, he won\xe2\x80\x99t shoot it. It\xe2\x80\x99s more of a fashion statement.\nHoward: Okay.\nBernadette: And just to be safe, when you talk to him, don\xe2\x80\x99t bring up Jimmy Carter, gardeners, foreign people, homosexuals, Sean Penn, Vatican II, gun control, organic food, the designated hitter rule, recycling or the fact that you\xe2\x80\x99re Jewish.\nHoward: Got it, got it. Will you e-mail me that list?\nBernadette: So the thing to watch for, if he\xe2\x80\x99s shouting at you, you\xe2\x80\x99re okay, but if he starts to get real quiet, leave as quickly as you can without making eye contact. Not in a straight line, throw some zigs and zigs in there.\nHoward: You know, this isn\xe2\x80\x99t that pressing. Why don\xe2\x80\x99t I talk to him about it in May.\nBernadette: In May you\xe2\x80\x99re gonna be on the International Space Station.\nHoward: They\xe2\x80\x99ve got a phone.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
