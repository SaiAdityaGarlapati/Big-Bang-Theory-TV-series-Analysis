b'Scene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Oh look, Saturn 3 is on.\nRaj: I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to watch Saturn 3. Deep Space Nine is better.\nSheldon: How is Deep Space Nine better than Saturn 3?\nRaj: Simple subtraction will tell you it\xe2\x80\x99s six better.\nLeonard: Compromise. Watch Babylon 5.\nSheldon: In what sense is that a compromise?\nLeonard: Well, five is partway between three\xe2\x80\xa6 Never mind.\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what, how about we go rock-paper-scissors?\nSheldon: Ooh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think so. No, anecdotal evidence suggests that in the game of rock-paper-scissors, players familiar with each other will tie 75 to 80% of the time due to the limited number of outcomes. I suggest rock-paper-scissors- lizard-Spock.\nRaj: What?\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s very simple. Look, scissors cuts paper. Paper covers rock. Rock crushes lizard. Lizard poisons Spock. Spock smashes scissors. Scissors decapitates lizard. Lizard eats paper. Paper disproves Spock. Spock vaporizes rock. And as it always has, rock crushes scissors.\nRaj: Okay, I think I got it. (They prepare)\nTogether: Rock-paper-scissors- lizard-Spock! (Both hold up the symbol for Spock) Oh!\nHoward (entering, wearing an eye patch): Hello, boys.\nLeonard: Ahoy, matey.\nHoward: Noticed the eye patch, did you? It\xe2\x80\x99s all part of a technique I\xe2\x80\x99ve been studying for picking up women. You employ a visual display designed to make yourself distinctive and memorable.\nSheldon: Oh yes, like the male peacock with brilliant plumage or the rutting baboon with engorged hindquarters.\nLeonard: Or in this case, the bar mitzvah boy with pinkeye.\nHoward: Mock me if you will, but it works. You show up at a club in something distinctive, scope out your target and toss out some negs.\nRaj: What are negs?\nHoward: A neg is a negative compliment that throws a pretty woman off her game, like \xe2\x80\x9cNormally, I\xe2\x80\x99m not turned on by big teeth, but on you, they work.\xe2\x80\x9d I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a whole list of \xe2\x80\x99em. Who wants to be my wingman?\nLeonard: You\xe2\x80\x99re not gonna need wingman, you\xe2\x80\x99re gonna need a paramedic.\nPenny (entering): Howard, your scooter\xe2\x80\x99s blocking my car. Aw, did you get pinkeye again?\nHoward: Step one, she notices the eye patch. May I say, Penny, not a lot of women could look as hot as you do with such greasy hair? (She reaches out, pulls his eye patch away from his face, then lets go allowing the elastic to spring it back into place.)\nPenny: Yeah, just move your stupid scooter before I pick it up and throw it in the dumpster.\nHoward: Ow.\nCredits sequence.\n  Scene: The same.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to watch the Clone Wars TV series until I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the Clone Wars movie. I prefer to let George Lucas disappoint me in the order he intended.\nLeonard: Well, I want to watch it now.\nSheldon: Then I believe we\xe2\x80\x99ve arrived at another quintessential rock-paper-scissors- lizard-Spock moment.\nLeonard: Watch whatever you want.\nRaj: I saw what you did there.\nSheldon: What did I do?\nLeonard (answering phone): Hello. Hey, Howard. What\xe2\x80\x99s wrong? Okay. Okay, we\xe2\x80\x99ll be right there.\nSheldon: What happened?\nLeonard: Howard\xe2\x80\x99s at the Mars Rover lab. He says he\xe2\x80\x99s in trouble. Defcon 5.\nSheldon: Defcon 5? Well, there\xe2\x80\x99s no need to rush.\nLeonard: What?\nSheldon: Defcon 5 means no danger. Defcon 1 is a crisis.\nLeonard: How can 5 not be worse than 1?\nRaj: Yeah, Star Trek V, worse than I.\nSheldon: Okay, first of all, that\xe2\x80\x99s a comparison of quality, not intensity. Secondly, Star Trek I is orders-of-magnitude worse than Star Trek V.\nRaj: Are you joking? Star Trek V is the standard against which all badness is measured.\nSheldon: No, no, no. Star Trek V has specific failures in writing and direction, while Star Trek I fails across the board, art direction, costuming, music, sound editing.\nLeonard: Can we just forget I said Defcon and go?\nRaj: Star Trek V!\nScene: A corridor at the university\n  Sheldon: All right, will you at least stipulate that Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home is inarguably the best?\nRaj: I have three words for you. Wrath of Khan.\nHoward: Oh, thank God, you\xe2\x80\x99re here.\nLeonard: What\xe2\x80\x99s the emergency?\nHoward: I got the Mars Rover stuck in a ditch.\nSheldon: Where?\nHoward: On a dusty highway just outside Bakersfield. Where do you think? On Mars!\nWoman (peering out of door): Howard, is everything okay?\nHoward: Yeah, baby, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be right in.\nSheldon: You brought a girl to the Mars Rover control room?\nHoward: Yeah, I picked her up in the bar. She\xe2\x80\x99s a doctor. One free barium enema and my mother won\xe2\x80\x99t care she\xe2\x80\x99s not Jewish.\nLeonard: Wait a minute, so the eye patch and the insults worked?\nHoward: No, there were three other guys with eye patches, iIt was a fiasco. What did work was, \xe2\x80\x9cHow\xe2\x80\x99d you like to visit a secret government facility?\xe2\x80\x9d\nSheldon: So what exactly do you want us to do?\nHoward: I need you and Raj to help me get the Rover out of the ditch, and I need you to get Stephanie out before somebody notices she\xe2\x80\x99s here. She doesn\xe2\x80\x99t exactly have clearance.\nSheldon: Really? They don\xe2\x80\x99t let strange women from honky-tonks come in and play with $200million government projects on distant planets?\nHoward: Yes, I was bad. Maybe she\xe2\x80\x99ll spank me. Can we please move on?\nGirl: Hey, Howard, you know, it\xe2\x80\x99s getting late, so do I get to drive this thing or what?\nHoward: Yeah. No. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, but something\xe2\x80\x99s come up. Kind of a Mars Rover, Mars Rover, can Howard come over, situation. So my friend Leonard is gonna take you home.\nGirl: Oh, okay. Let\xe2\x80\x99s go, friend Leonard.\nLeonard: Okay.\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99ll call ya.\nGirl: Yeah. So are you a scientist like Howard?\nLeonard: No one\xe2\x80\x99s a scientist like Howard.\nHoward: My mother is so gonna love her.\nSheldon: Oh, how nice. Maybe they can carpool when they visit you in federal prison.\nScene: Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s car. Leonard and the girl are kissing.\nGirl: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. I totally interrupted you. What, what, what were you saying?\nLeonard: Just said Howard\xe2\x80\x99s a terrific guy. He\xe2\x80\x99s got a great sense of humour, he loves his mother, a lot, some people say too much.\nGirl: I really like that you\xe2\x80\x99re such a loyal friend.\nLeonard: Yeah, I am loyal. You know, if you look at the big picture. Just, out of curiosity, did he ever have a shot with you?\nGirl: Are you insane? The guy was wearing an eye patch.\nLeonard: Then why did you?\nGirl: He said that I could drive a car on Mars.\nLeonard: Got it. So, can I see you again?\nGirl: You\xe2\x80\x99re not gonna see me now.\nLeonard: Ooh. Cool.\nScene: The Mars Rover control room.\n  Howard: Anything?\nRaj: Actually, I was just checking my e-mail. But, uh, no, the Rover is not responding.\nSheldon: I believe the appropriate metaphor here involves a river of excrement and a Native American water vessel without any means of propulsion.\nHoward: Hang on, there\xe2\x80\x99s got to be other options.\nRaj: You could try calling Triple-A, but based on NASA\xe2\x80\x99s latest timetable, they won\xe2\x80\x99t get there for 35 years.\nSheldon: Plus I understand you have to be standing next to the vehicle with your card when they arrive.\nRaj: Oh, snap.\nSheldon: Snap what?\nHoward: OK, I guess we have to turn to Plan B.\nRaj: What\xe2\x80\x99s Plan B?\nHoward: Erase all the hard drives, scrap the surveillance tapes, wipe our fingerprints off every surface and run.\nSheldon: Why wasn\xe2\x80\x99t that Plan A?\nScene: The apartment.\n  Voice from television: REPORTER: A NASA spokesman states that due to the loss of data, they will most likely be unable to determine the cause of the Mars Rover\xe2\x80\x99s malfunction. This is not the first time an exploratory mission to Mars has ended in disappointment.\nHoward: Thank God for Plan B.\nPenny: Howard, didn\xe2\x80\x99t you say you worked on the Mars Rover?\nHoward: No, you\xe2\x80\x99re mistaken.\nPenny: Yeah, when we first met, you said that if I went out with you, I could drive a car on Mars.\nHoward: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about.\nLeonard: Psst! Psst!\nSheldon: Will you all excuse me? Leonard is subtly signalling that he\xe2\x80\x99d like to talk to me in private.\nPenny: No. Yeah, I remember specifically. You started by asking if I was from Mars because my ass was out of this world.\nHoward: Well, that does sound like me, but no.\nSheldon: Is there some problem?\nLeonard: Yeah. Listen, I have to kinda sneak out for a while.\nSheldon: All right, goodbye.\nLeonard: No, wait! If anyone asks you where I went, you don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\nSheldon: Where are you going?\nLeonard: I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell you that.\nSheldon: Who would ask me?\nLeonard: I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell you that, either.\nSheldon: So you brought me in here to inform me that you can\xe2\x80\x99t tell me where you\xe2\x80\x99re going and you can\xe2\x80\x99t tell me who might ask?\nLeonard: Yeah, I really didn\xe2\x80\x99t think this through.\nSheldon: Leonard, a moment.\nLeonard: What?\nSheldon: If someone, and of course, we don\xe2\x80\x99t know who this would be, does ask where you\xe2\x80\x99ve gone, what should I say?\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Just tell them I went to the office.\nSheldon: Are you going to the office?\nLeonard: No.\nSheldon: Then how can I say it convincingly?\nLeonard: Just say, Leonard went to the office.\nSheldon: All right. Leonard went to (exaggerated) the office.\nLeonard: What is? No, not like that! Just, Leonard went to the office.\nSheldon: This would have worked out a lot better if you\xe2\x80\x99d just told me you were going the office.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m going to the office.\nSheldon: See? Why don\xe2\x80\x99t I believe you?\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m going out for a while.\nHoward: Okay.\nSheldon: Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t anyone want to know where he\xe2\x80\x99s going?\nPenny: Okay, where is he going?\nSheldon: Leonard is going to (exaggerated) the office.\nScene: The girl\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nLeonard: So how was work today?\nGirl: Busy. I removed an appendix, a gall bladder and about a foot and a half of bowel.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m hoping that\xe2\x80\x99s three different guys.\nGirl: No, just the one. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t make it. So, how was your day?\nLeonard: Oh, you know, I\xe2\x80\x99m a physicist, so, I thought about stuff.\nGirl: That\xe2\x80\x99s it?\nLeonard: Well, I wrote some of it down.\nGirl: Are you done eating?\nLeonard: Uh, yeah.\nGirl: Oh, good. (Kisses him)\nLeonard: If I knew you were waiting, I would\xe2\x80\x99ve swallowed that lasagna whole.\nPhone rings. Answering machine: You\xe2\x80\x99ve reached Dr. Stephanie Barnett. Leave a message. Beep.\nHoward (voice): Hey, Steph, it\xe2\x80\x99s me again, Howard. Listen, if you\xe2\x80\x99re free Friday, maybe we could have a little something to eat at my place. My mom cooks a hell of a brisket. Let me know. It\xe2\x80\x99s Howard.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99ve had her brisket. Melts in your mouth.\nTime shift\nSteph: Maybe we should think about going to the bedroom.\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99s a good idea. There\xe2\x80\x99s a bed in there, and I\xe2\x80\x99m very, very, very pro-bed.\nPhone rings. Answering machine: You\xe2\x80\x99ve reached Dr. Stephanie Barnett. Leave a message. Beep.\nHoward (voice): Hey, it\xe2\x80\x99s me again. Just want to let you know the head count for dinner Friday has gone up. My Aunt Betty and Uncle Elliot are coming in from Palm Springs. Oh, and if anybody should ask, you\xe2\x80\x99re half-Jewish on your mother\xe2\x80\x99s side. Okay, call me. It\xe2\x80\x99s Howard.\nLeonard: Don\xe2\x80\x99t you think we should tell him you\xe2\x80\x99re not interested?\nSteph: Do you want me to stop and call him back right now?\nLeonard: Dear God, no!\nTime shift\nSteph (from bedroom door): Oh, Leonard\xe2\x80\xa6\nPhone rings. Answering machine: You\xe2\x80\x99ve reached Dr. Stephanie Barnett. Leave a message. Beep.\nHoward (voice): Hey, it\xe2\x80\x99s me again. Howard. Listen, my cousins from Fort Lauderdale are flying in to meet you so that means we\xe2\x80\x99re gonna have to move the dinner to a restaurant.\nHoward\xe2\x80\x99s Mother (voice): Tell her we\xe2\x80\x99re going to the Olive Garden! I have a coupon from the paper.\nHoward (voice): We\xe2\x80\x99re not going to the Olive Garden, Mom!\nHoward\xe2\x80\x99s Mother (voice): Oh, Mr. Bigshot with his Red Lobster.\nHoward (voice): I\xe2\x80\x99ll call you back when we firm up the details. It\xe2\x80\x99s Howard.\nScene: The laundry room\nPenny: Oh, hey.\nLeonard: Hey.\nPenny: New shirts?\nLeonard: Yeah, a couple.\nPenny: Nice.\nLeonard:  Thank you.\nPenny: So, who\xe2\x80\x99s the girl?\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry?\nPenny: Well, last time you bought a new shirt was when we were dating.\nLeonard: So, uh, what we did was in fact dating?\nPenny: Well, yeah, we did have a date.\nLeonard: Exactly. Thank you. Do me a favour, tell Koothrappali that next time you see him.\nPenny: So, who is she?\nLeonard: Oh, she\xe2\x80\x99s a doctor.\nPenny: Oh, nice. A doctor doctor, or a you kind of doctor?\nLeonard: Doctor doctor. Surgical resident. Smart, pretty. Let me ask you something. If your friend thinks he\xe2\x80\x99s dating someone, but he\xe2\x80\x99s not because, in fact, you\xe2\x80\x99re dating her, does that make you a bad person?\nPenny: Well, that depends.\nLeonard: On what?\nPenny: Is that friend Wolowitz?\nLeonard: Yeah.\nPenny: Screw him. You\xe2\x80\x99re fine.\nLeonard: Are you sure?\nPenny: Well, have you slept with her yet? You dog! Good for you.\nLeonard: Does that change things?\nPenny: No.\nLeonard: So why\xe2\x80\x99d you ask?\nPenny: I\xe2\x80\x99m nosy. See ya.\nScene: Outside Howard\xe2\x80\x99s front door.\n  Howard\xe2\x80\x99s Mother (voice): Howard, get the door!\nHoward (voice): Really? Is that what you do when someone knocks? Thank you. I had no idea! (opening door) Hey, buddy. What brings you to my little slice of hell?\nHoward\xe2\x80\x99s Mother (voice): Who is it?!\nHoward: It\xe2\x80\x99s Leonard!\nHoward\xe2\x80\x99s Mother (voice): You\xe2\x80\x99re gonna have to play outside! I\xe2\x80\x99m not dressed to receive!\nHoward: No one cares, Ma! So, what\xe2\x80\x99s up?\nLeonard: Listen, I need to talk to you about something.\nHoward (his phone rings): Momentito. Yello. Oh, Stephanie, thanks for calling me back. I was worried\xe2\x80\xa6 Oh\xe2\x80\xa6 Uh-huh\xe2\x80\xa6 Uh-huh\xe2\x80\xa6 Uh-huh\xe2\x80\xa6 No, I understand\xe2\x80\xa6 Sure, we can be friends. Absolutely. Thanks for calling. Yeah, you have a nice day, too. (To Leonard) You are dead to me.\nScene: The apartment\n  Raj: Okay, who gets the extra dumpling?\nAll: Rock-paper-scissors- lizard-Spock.\nSheldon: Okay, one of us is going to have to stop putting up Spock.\nHoward: How do we decide that?\nAll: Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock. Oh!\nLeonard: Oh, hey, guys.\nSheldon: Hello.\nRaj: Hey.\nLeonard: Hi, Howard. Howard?\nHoward: Sheldon.\nSheldon: Howard is employing a schoolyard paradigm in which you are, for all intents and purposes, deceased. He intends to act on this by not speaking to you, feigning an inability to hear you when you speak and otherwise refusing to acknowledge your existence.\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99s just ridiculous. Why are you cooperating with him?\nSheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t make the rules, Leonard.\nLeonard: Howard, come on, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t plan on this. These things just happen. Usually not to me, but they do happen.\nHoward: Did someone just feel a cold breeze?\nSheldon: I believe this is an extension of the death metaphor. The cold breeze is the so-called ectoplasmic issue of a disembodied soul passing by.\nRaj: You know, screw it, I\xe2\x80\x99m just gonna eat the dumpling.\nLeonard (answering door): Oh, hi, Steph, come on in.\nSteph:  Is this a bad time?\nLeonard: Yeah, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t see a better one on the horizon, so\xe2\x80\xa6\nHoward: Oh, if it isn\xe2\x80\x99t Mrs. Dead to Me.\nSteph: Hello, Howard.\nHoward: Sheldon?\nSheldon: Look I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, you violated the terms of your metaphor by acknowledging her existence. I\xe2\x80\x99m out.\nLeonard: He just won\xe2\x80\x99t listen to me.\nSteph: Okay, I guess it\xe2\x80\x99ll just be the three of us then.\nLeonard: Hmm. Lisa\xe2\x80\x99s gonna be disappointed.\nSteph: Yeah.\nHoward: Lisa?\nSteph: Yeah, my roommate. She just went through a really bad breakup and I thought she might like to meet somebody fun like you.\nHoward: Leonard, Stephanie, you\xe2\x80\x99re alive, it\xe2\x80\x99s a miracle!\nScene: The apartment kitchen. Howard is on the phone.\n  Howard: So, anyway, Lisa, I just wanted to tell you again how much I enjoyed the other night, and again, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry for how it ended. But again, if you could let me know about Friday. My mother needs a head count so she can know how big a brisket to get.\nLeonard: Howard, Howard, look at this.\nHoward: Anyway, call me. It\xe2\x80\x99s Howard.\nVoice from TV: The possibility of life on Mars has long fascinated scientists and laypersons alike. It\xe2\x80\x99s unclear how the Mars Rover got into the crevice, but one thing\xe2\x80\x99s certain, the data which it has sent back contain the first clear indications that there may have been life on Mars. It\xe2\x80\x99s a scientific discovery that has staggering implications for all mankind. Unfortunately, we\xe2\x80\x99ll never know who\xe2\x80\x99s responsible.\nHoward: Son of a bitch.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
