b'Scene: The cafeteria.\nLeonard: Oh, hey, oh, we ran into your mom at Benihana last night.\nHoward: Oh, yeah, she loves that place. Every time they flip a shrimp in the air, she practically leaps out of her seat to catch it. That\xe2\x80\x99s why I don\xe2\x80\x99t take her to SeaWorld.\nLeonard: I know you-you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to hear it, but she was there with Stuart.\nHoward: That\xe2\x80\x99s fine. I don\xe2\x80\x99t care.\nRajj: It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t bug you when they go out on dates?\nHoward: They\xe2\x80\x99re not dating. They\xe2\x80\x99re just two friends who went out to dinner.\nRaj: And then went back to the home they share where they probably fell asleep in the matching pajamas she got them because they both just love penguins.\nHoward: Hey, lots of people wear matching pajamas who aren\xe2\x80\x99t dating.\nRaj: Like who?\nHoward: Like you and your dog.\nLeonard: Don\xe2\x80\x99t rule out the dating.\nHoward: Fine, it bothers me. You happy?\nSheldon: You think you\xe2\x80\x99ve got problems. The gibbon is the only member of the ape family not classified as a great ape.\nHoward: How is this helpful?\nSheldon: All the non-human apes are classified as great apes except one. That means taxonomists created the entire category of lesser ape just to single out the poor gibbon as the weird kid on the playground. Now there\xe2\x80\x99s a hairy little fellow with a genuine beef.\nLeonard: But the gibbon doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know what it\xe2\x80\x99s categorized as. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t even know it\xe2\x80\x99s called a gibbon.\nSheldon: True. Sorry, kid, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got it worse than a gibbon.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s Apartment.\nAmy: Hi.\nPenny: Hey.\nBernadette: We brought snacks for movie night.\nPenny: Oh, great. I don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose you also brought napkins, clean bowls, utensils and a roll of toilet paper.\nBernadette: Right here.\nPenny: Ah, You guys are the best.\nAmy: What\xe2\x80\x99s with the clothes?\nPenny: Well, with all the new stuff I bought for work, I needed to make room in my closet.\nAmy: I meant why are they folded? But whatever. Ooh, what\xe2\x80\x99s this?\nPenny: That, believe it or not, is my prom dress.\nBernadette: Wow, you still have it? I just assumed it was balled up in the corner of a barn somewhere.\nPenny: What kind of teenager did you think I was?\nBernadette: Slutty.\nAmy: Easy.\nPenny: The word is popular.\nBernadette: How was your prom? Did you go?\nAmy: No, but I was on clean-up crew.\nPenny: Aw, that\xe2\x80\x99s sad.\nAmy: No, it was okay. The DJ let me dance one slow song with my mop before he shut down. Whenever I see a bucket of dirty water, I still hear Lady in Red.\nBernadette: My prom was pretty terrible, too. I was so excited about my date, but it turned out he only asked me \xe2\x80\x99cause he liked my friend. He spent the whole night talking about her.\nAmy: Okay, we get it, you had a friend and a date. Stop bragging.\nPenny: Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter. Prom is silly anyways.\nBernadette: Easy for you to say; you probably went with the captain of the football team.\nPenny: No. I just made out with him a little while his date was puking.\nAmy: My date would\xe2\x80\x99ve had to clean that up.\nBernadette: Ooh, I have an idea. Maybe we can have, like, a prom do-over.\nAmy: Oh, that would be so much fun. We could decorate the roof and make the guys wear tuxedos.\nBernadette: Ooh, and get our hair done, and slow-dance.\nPenny: Okay, guys, trust me, as someone who\xe2\x80\x99s been to, like, seven proms, it is never as good as you want it to be.\nAmy: You went to seven proms?\nPenny: Yeah, let\xe2\x80\x99s see. Uh, four Under the Seas, two Enchanted Evenings, and one Night to Remember that I cannot remember for the life of me.\nScene: The apartment.\nHoward: Hey.\nRaj: Hey.\nLeonard: Hey, where\xe2\x80\x99s Bernadette?\nHoward: She and Amy are out dress shopping for their prom thing.\nRaj: Oh, yeah, I got that Evite. Ever since I saw Pretty in Pink, I\xe2\x80\x99ve wanted to go to an American prom. But then I saw Carrie, and I did not want to go to an American prom. But then I saw Never Been Kissed, and I\xe2\x80\x99m back on the prom bandwagon. This prom thing\xe2\x80\x99s been a real roller coaster.\nHoward: Bernie\xe2\x80\x99s really excited. I could tell because her voice got so high, the beagle next door started howling.\nRaj: Did you go to your prom?\nSheldon: No. I had a date with a proper education. Instead of a tuxedo, I dressed myself in good habits. Instead of spiked punch, I enjoyed the intoxicating flavour of knowledge. Instead of dancing in a gym, I shook my bootyto the seductive rhythms\xe2\x80\xa6\nPenny: Okay, okay.\nShldon: \xe2\x80\xa6of AP Calculus.\nRaj: How come you\xe2\x80\x99re not shopping with Amy and Bernadette?\nLeonard: Let me guess, you think the whole idea is lame?\nPenny: Well, who cares what I think? What do you think?\nLeonard: Hmm, to be honest, it\xe2\x80\x99s kind of a dream come true to go to even a fake prom with a woman as beautiful as you.\nPenny: Ugh, thanks a lot.\nLeonard: What?\nPenny: Well, now I can\xe2\x80\x99t blow this thing off without being a bitch.\nRaj: That sounds like a yes.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nBernadette: Ooh, every single person RSVP\xe2\x80\x99d yes. This is so exciting. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t this exciting?\nHoward: Yep.\nBernadette: Look, even Stuart\xe2\x80\x99s bringing a date. I wonder who it is.\nHoward: You know exactly who it is. He\xe2\x80\x99s gonna bring my mom. Why did you even invite him?\nBernadette: Because he\xe2\x80\x99s our friend, and you two need to get along. And why can\xe2\x80\x99t he take your mom? You took her to your prom.\nHoward: I didn\xe2\x80\x99t take her, she was a chaperone.\nBernadette: I saw a picture of you two dancing together.\nHoward: What was I gonna do? They were playing our song. I can\xe2\x80\x99t take this anymore.\nStuart (on phone): Hello.\nHoward: Stuart, we have to talk. This thing with you and my mom, I hate it. It\xe2\x80\x99s making me crazy. You and I were friends for years, and now you\xe2\x80\x99re bringing my mother to a party I\xe2\x80\x99m going to? What the hell?\nStuart: I\xe2\x80\x99m not bringing your mother, I have a date.\nHoward: Oh, so now you\xe2\x80\x99re cheating on my mother?\nStuart: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What are you talking about? There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing weird going on with me and your mother.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Stewie, your bath is getting cold!\nStuart: I got to go, bye.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Penny? (Knock, knock, knock) Penny? (Knock, knock, knock) Penny? (Knock, knock, knock) Penny? (Knock, knock, knock) Penny?\nPenny: You knocked more than usual.\nSheldon: Next time I might be in a rush, it\xe2\x80\x99s good to have a few in the bank.\nPenny: Okay, what\xe2\x80\x99s up?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99d like to discuss this party that Amy and Bernadette are throwing. Since you and I are both reluctant to go, I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve come up with a perfect way for us to enjoy it.\nPenny: Great, how?\nSheldon: We pretend we\xe2\x80\x99re aliens. I\xe2\x80\x99m not the best at reading facial cues, but I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna say that you love it and want to hear more. Now, in the beloved novel Hitchhiker\xe2\x80\x99s Guide to the Galaxy, an alien named Ford Prefect pretended to be human in order to blend in so that he could write an entry about Earth for The Hitchhiker\xe2\x80\x99s Guide to the Galaxy, which is a travel book within the actual book, which is also called The Hitchhiker\xe2\x80\x99s Guide to the Galaxy.\nPenny: Okay, just one question. What?\nSheldon: My point is, pretending to be an alien is a valuable coping mechanism I\xe2\x80\x99ve used many times. I did it the first time I went to see you in a play. You had no idea Commander Umfrumf of Ceti Alpha Three was in the audience. Oh, don\xe2\x80\x99t worry, he gave you seven thumbs up.\nPenny: Here\xe2\x80\x99s a question, as an alien pretending to be human, are you planning to engage in any post-prom mating rituals with Amy?\nSheldon: There are post-prom mating rituals?\nPenny: Not always. Unless your date drives a van with an air mattress, then always.\nSheldon: Well, if it\xe2\x80\x99s part of the prom experience, then I\xe2\x80\x99m open to it.\nPenny: You\xe2\x80\x99re kidding.\nSheldon: I may be an alien, but I have urges. If Amy wants to copulate by firing her eggs into space, well, then, I will happily catch them with the reproductive sac on my upper flermin. I\xe2\x80\x99m not the best at reading facial cues, but I can see that you\xe2\x80\x99re a little turned on.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: You know, if you\xe2\x80\x99re not gonna learn how to do this, they make some pretty good clip-ons.\nSheldon: Bruce Wayne doesn\xe2\x80\x99t wear a clip-on.\nLeonard: Bruce Wayne doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make his roommate tie it for him.\nSheldon: His name is Alfred, and, yes, he does.\nLeonard: There, perfect.\nSheldon: What, are you sure? It\xe2\x80\x99s my first prom, I want to do it correctly.\nLeonard: I thought you were gonna pretend to be an alien.\nSheldon: I was, but Penny didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to. You didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to. Bernadette, Amy, Koothrappali and Wolowitz didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to. And even I knew it was weird to hire somebody.\nLeonard: Was that a flask?\nSheldon: Yes. I\xe2\x80\x99ve decided to embrace all of the traditions associated with prom, including spiking the punch.\nLeonard: You\xe2\x80\x99re gonna put alcohol in the punch?\nSheldon: Oh, no, this is pomegranate juice. It\xe2\x80\x99s all the fun of high school high jinks with the cell-protecting zip of antioxidants.\nLeonard: If you had ripped jeans and a leather jacket, you\xe2\x80\x99d be like the toughest kid on the Disney Channel. So, anything else planned for tonight?\nSheldon: Oh, everything. Getting our picture taken, slow-dancing, being elected prom king. Pointing out that kings aren\xe2\x80\x99t elected. It\xe2\x80\x99s gonna be off the hook.\nLeonard: And while you\xe2\x80\x99re at it, I know that at this age your hormones are raging, but just because all your friends are having sex doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean you have to.\nSheldon: Why would you say that?\nLeonard: You know, \xe2\x80\x99cause, \xe2\x80\x99cause a lot of people lose their virginity on prom night.\nSheldon: Penny implied the same thing. Is this true?\nLeonard: Just relax, it\xe2\x80\x99s a joke. You don\xe2\x80\x99t have hormones.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nLeonard: Wow, you look amazing.\nPenny: Thank you, so do you.\nAmy: Sheldon, you look so handsome.\nSheldon: Thank you.\nPenny: Sheldon, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t Amy look hot? That\xe2\x80\x99s got to put some starch in the upper flermin.\nAmy: What\xe2\x80\x99s that?\nLeonard: Oh, it\xe2\x80\x99s a scaly genital organ that grows between his shoulder blades. Try not to touch it when you\xe2\x80\x99re dancing.\nSheldon: Excuse me.\nAmy: Where are you going?\nSheldon: I can\xe2\x80\x99t do this. And for your information, Leonard, the upper flermin doesn\xe2\x80\x99t grow between my shoulder blades, it grows out of the belly button on my neck.\nLeonard: He\xe2\x80\x99s right, I was thinking of the lower flermin.\nScene: A limo.\nRaj: Ooh, I\xe2\x80\x99ll, uh, text Stuart, let him know we\xe2\x80\x99re close.\nBernadette: That\xe2\x80\x99s a neat tattoo.\nEmily: Oh, thanks, it\xe2\x80\x99s Sally from Nightmare before Christmas.\nBernadette: Aw, that movie\xe2\x80\x99s so cute.\nHoward: Do you like her because you both have red hair?\nEmily: Uh, a little, but more that she\xe2\x80\x99s covered in scars and can pull her own limbs off and sew them back on.\nBernadette: I like Cinderella.\nEmily: Did you know, in the original book, the sisters cut off their toes with knives in order to fit in the glass slipper?\nBernadette: I like Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo.\nRaj: Hey, here comes Stuart and his date.\nEmily: Oh, she\xe2\x80\x99s cute.\nHoward: Oh, my God.\nBernadette: What?\nHoward: That\xe2\x80\x99s Jeanie.\nBernadette: That\xe2\x80\x99s Jeanie?\nEmily: Who\xe2\x80\x99s Jeanie?\nHoward: Don\xe2\x80\x99t say it.\nRaj: That\xe2\x80\x99s Howard\xe2\x80\x99s cousin that he had sex with.\nHoward: She is my second cousin. We were 15, I just said, don\xe2\x80\x99t say it.\nEmily: No, it\xe2\x80\x99s okay. He told me that story a long time ago.\nHoward: Raj.\nRaj: It was our first date, there was an awkward silence. What was I supposed to say?\nScene: The rooftop.\nPenny: Oh, it\xe2\x80\x99s beautiful.\nLeonard: Oh, the girls really did a nice job.\nPenny: Aw, I know I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t into this before, but I\xe2\x80\x99m so glad I get to take you to your first prom.\nLeonard: What makes you think I didn\xe2\x80\x99t go to my prom? I went.\nPenny: Well, who\xe2\x80\x99d you go with?\nLeonard: I took a little lady I like to call loneliness.\nPenny: Aw.\nLeonard: Oh, it\xe2\x80\x99s all right. We ended up having a threesome with her friend humiliation, so\xe2\x80\xa6\nPenny: Well, if I would have been there and saw you alone, I would\xe2\x80\x99ve asked you to dance.\nLeonard: No, you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have.\nPenny: Well, you don\xe2\x80\x99t know that.\nLeonard: It was before my growth spurt.\nPenny: What, that already happened?\nLeonard: Very funny.\nPenny: Well, you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have asked me either.\nLeonard: I would have asked you. In my head. On the way home. While I was having a good cry.\nScene: Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom.\nAmy: Sheldon, can I come in?\nSheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x99s a good idea.\nAmy: Why not?\nSheldon: According to an online message board, I may be having a panic attack. SoccerMom09 had similar symptoms. But to be fair, the twins were a real handful that day.\nAmy: You\xe2\x80\x99re making me worry. What\xe2\x80\x99s going on?\nSheldon: What\xe2\x80\x99s going on is we\xe2\x80\x99re about to go to a prom. And there\xe2\x80\x99s a great deal of pressure on young couples like us to engage in what Mr. Bob Eubanks called making whoopee.\nAmy: What pressure? All I said was you look handsome. Can you please open the door?\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s not just that. Leonard and Penny also made comments about it. And I\xe2\x80\x99m not blind. Even I looked twice when I saw my posterior in these tuxedo pants.\nSceme: The limo.\nStuart: So, I met Jeanie at your Aunt Gladys\xe2\x80\x99. She passed me the Manischewitz, I took one look at this punim, and I almost plotzed on the kugel.\nRajj: Is this what I sound like when I talk about India?\nHoward: So, my mother\xe2\x80\x99s okay with this?\nJeannie: Why would your mother have a problem with me and Stuart?\nHoward: \xe2\x80\x98Cause they have a weird, inappropriate relationship.\nJeannie: Weirder than what you and I did in my dad\xe2\x80\x99s Corolla?\nRaj: This is so messed up.\nEmily: I know, I\xe2\x80\x99m having the best time.\nHoward: Why would you even come to this? Didn\xe2\x80\x99t you know I\xe2\x80\x99d be here?\nJeannie: It was a long time ago, Howard.\nStuart: And you\xe2\x80\x99re only second cousins, who cares?\nBernadette: So, you knew and you brought her anyway?\nStuart: Oh, so she\xe2\x80\x99s good enough for Howard, but not for me?\nHoward: Yeah.\nBernadette: Yeah, go have weird relationships with your own mother and cousin. This is his turf.\nHoward: Yeah.\nScene: The rooftop.\nPenny: Well, I might not have asked you to dance then, but I will ask you now.\nLeonard: There\xe2\x80\x99s no music.\nPenny: I don\xe2\x80\x99t care. We\xe2\x80\x99ll make our own music.\nLeonard: My God, who\xe2\x80\x99s the dork now? Thank you for wearing your flats.\nPenny: Thank you for wearing your heels.\nLeonard: Look at me. Dancing with the prettiest girl at the prom.\nPenny: Want to take a picture of us and send it to your old friends in the chess club?\nLeonard: I sent them a bikini shot of you years ago. This is nice. I kind of wish no one else was coming.\nPenny: I know, me, too. But it will be fun to have a prom without all the drama.\nScene: The limo.\nBernadette: Howie, get off of him.\nHoward: Not until he stops humping his way up my family tree.\nScene: Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s bedrooom.\nAmy: Sheldon, this is silly. I\xe2\x80\x99m not missing another prom. I\xe2\x80\x99m going upstairs now. Good-bye.\nSheldon: I really did think you looked pretty.\nAmy: You did?\nSheldon: Yes. So much so that I started to panic.\nAmy: Well, you can relax. Just because you think I look pretty doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean we have to spend the night together.\nSheldon: Were you hoping we would because it\xe2\x80\x99s prom?\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99m always hoping. But tonight I just wanted to have a nice time with you. And maybe dance with someone who has arms.\nSheldon: Thank you for understanding.\nAmy: Of course I understand. Sheldon, there\xe2\x80\x99s something else I\xe2\x80\x99ve been wanting to say, but before I do, I just, I want you to know that you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to say it back. I know you\xe2\x80\x99re not ready, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t want you to say it just because social convention dictates\xe2\x80\xa6\nSheldon: I love you, too.\nAmy: You said it.\nSheldon: There\xe2\x80\x99s no denying I have feelings for you that can\xe2\x80\x99t be explained in any other way. I briefly considered that I had a brain parasite. But that seems even more farfetched. The only conclusion was love. I know what\xe2\x80\x99s happening. This is a panic attack. SoccerMom09 says to lie down with your feet elevated.\nAmy: Okay.\nSheldon: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Just because I love you doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean girls are allowed in my room.\nScene: The rooftop.\nRaj: Okay. Here we go, say cheese. Iskip) Say cheese. Iskip) Say cousin. Iskip) Say\xe2\x80\xa6\nStuart: Oh, sorry. Hang on, sorry. (On phone) Hey, Debbie. I, yeah, yeah, I\xe2\x80\x99m here with Jeanie. Okay, but we\xe2\x80\x99re just friends. It\xe2\x80\x99s, yeah. I got to go.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
