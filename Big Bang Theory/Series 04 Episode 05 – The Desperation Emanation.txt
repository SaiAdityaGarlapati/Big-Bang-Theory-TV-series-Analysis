b'Scene: The apartment.\nLeonard: All I\xe2\x80\x99m saying is, if they took all the money they spent trying to make a decent Hulk movie, they could probably just make an actual Hulk.\nSheldon: That is apt and amusing. I think I shall share that with Amy Farrah Fowler. She\xe2\x80\x99ll appreciate the witticism.\nLeonard: Thank you.\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99ll also help improve her initial impression of you.\nLeonard: So what\xe2\x80\x99s going on with you two?\nSheldon: Well, the status is as it always was. She\xe2\x80\x99s a girl. She\xe2\x80\x99s a friend. She is not my, please forgive me for doing this, girlfriend.\nLeonard: Right, right. So you\xe2\x80\x99re still just texting and emailing? You don\xe2\x80\x99t feel any need to hang out with her, you know, be in the same room?\nSheldon: Leonard, you are my best friend. I\xe2\x80\x99ve known you for seven years, and I can barely tolerate sitting on the couch with you. Imagine my attitude regarding prolonged physical proximity to Amy Farrah Fowler.\nLeonard: Got it.\nSheldon: I sense judgment on your part.\nLeonard: No, no. Maybe a little.\nSheldon: May I suggest that your criticism is based on jealousy.\nLeonard: Jealousy? What do I have to be jealous of?\nSheldon: I have a functioning and satisfying relationship with a female. You have none.\nLeonard: Oh, right. That.\nSheldon: Jealousy is an ugly green-eyed monster, not unlike the Hulk, who, by the way, also has a girlfriend. In this iteration, Jennifer Connelly, whom you may recall as the girlfriend of Russell Crowe in A Beautiful Mind, a feel-good romp if there ever was one.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m not jealous.\nSheldon: Hu-u-urgh! Leonard not jealous.\nCredits sequence.\n  Scene: The apartment.\nSheldon: You know, it just occurred to me, if there are an infinite number of parallel universes, in one of them, there\xe2\x80\x99s probably a Sheldon who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t believe parallel universes exist.\nLeonard: Probably. What\xe2\x80\x99s your point?\nSheldon: No point. It\xe2\x80\x99s just one of the things that makes one of the mes chuckle. What makes you chuckle, Leonard?\nLeonard: Hmm, recently? Not much.\nSheldon: Is it because of the conflict that arises from your desperate need to pair-bond with a woman, and the apparent collective decision of all womankind to deny you that opportunity?\nLeonard: Um, shut up.\nSheldon: You know, when my grandfather died, and Meemaw was alone, my mom arranged for her to visit a centre three times a week where she could socialize with other lonely people. It\xe2\x80\x99s very nice. They discuss current events, play bridge, get a hot meal.\nLeonard: That sounds lovely.\nSheldon: It is if you like bridge. Do you like bridge, Leonard?\nLeonard: Sheldon, I\xe2\x80\x99m just not dating someone right now. I don\xe2\x80\x99t need to go to a senior centre.\nSheldon: Meemaw resisted at first, but now she loves it.\nLeonard: Fine. If I don\xe2\x80\x99t meet someone soon, you can put me in a home.\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s not a home. It\xe2\x80\x99s a senior centre.  We\xe2\x80\x99d never put Meemaw in a home!\nScene: The comic book store.\nLeonard: Hey, guys.\nHoward: Hey.\nRaj: Hey.\nSheldon: All right, I\xe2\x80\x99ll bow to social pressure. Hey!\nHoward (phone rings): Excuse me. That\xe2\x80\x99s my girlfriend, Bernadette. I assigned her her own ringtone, Bernadette by The Four Tops. Hello, Bernadette.\nRaj: When I call him, his phone plays Brown Eyed Girl. Which, now that I think about it, is not so good.\nLeonard: You realize he\xe2\x80\x99s just rubbing our noses in the fact that he has a girlfriend, and we don\xe2\x80\x99t.\nRai: You mean, you don\xe2\x80\x99t.\nLeonard: You have a girlfriend? How could you have a girlfriend? You can\xe2\x80\x99t even speak to women.\nRaj: Two words, deaf chick. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter if I can\xe2\x80\x99t talk, because she can\xe2\x80\x99t hear me.\nLeonard: What?\nRaj: That\xe2\x80\x99s what she said.\nLeonard: Great. You have a girlfriend, Howard\xe2\x80\x99s got a girlfriend, Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s got a girl\xe2\x80\xa6\nSheldon: No, no, no, no!\nLeonard: \xe2\x80\xa6who\xe2\x80\x99s a friend.\nSheldon: Thank you.\nLeonard: What about you, Stuart? You have a girlfriend yet?\nStuart: Oh, yeah. Yeah. I met her at Comic-Con, the one place in the world where saying I own a comic bookstore is an actual pickup line.\nLeonard: Oh. Well, good for you.\nStuart: Not really. She\xe2\x80\x99s horrible. When she wants to have sex, she puts on her plus-size Wonder Woman costume and shouts who wants to take a ride in my invisible plane?\nLeonard: Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you just break up with her?\nStuart: No, no, I can\xe2\x80\x99t.\nLeonard: Why not?\nStuart: \xe2\x80\x98Cause then I\xe2\x80\x99d be alone, like you.\nRaj: Dude, why don\xe2\x80\x99t you just invoke your girlfriend pact with Wolowitz?\nLeonard: Because I don\xe2\x80\x99t need his girlfriend to set me up with one of her girlfriends. I\xe2\x80\x99m perfectly capable of finding a girl on my own.\nRaj: Oh, Leonard, you remind me of the funny old story about a man who walks into a women\xe2\x80\x99s correctional institution with a stack of paperwork that will allow the female convicts to go free.\nLeonard: You\xe2\x80\x99re saying I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get laid in a women\xe2\x80\x99s prison with a handful of pardons.\nRaj: Are you going to let me tell the story or not?\nScene: The apartment. Leonard is stretched face down on the sofa.\nSheldon: Leonard? Are you sleeping?\nLeonard: No.\nSheldon: Are you ill?\nLeonard: No.\nSheldon: Are you still depressed because you\xe2\x80\x99re alone, and no one loves you?\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Maybe.\nSheldon: I want you to know that I\xe2\x80\x99m genuinely concerned about your well-being.\nLeonard: Thank you.\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re welcome. But it\xe2\x80\x99s still no reason to have your feet in my spot.\nAmy (on webcam): May I offer an observation?\nLeonard: What the hell? How long has she been here?\nSheldon: Since we got home from the comic bookstore.\nLeonard: That was two hours ago.\nSheldon: As per your suggestion, we\xe2\x80\x99re hanging out. Quite frankly, I don\xe2\x80\x99t see what all the hoopla\xe2\x80\x99s about. Go on, Amy.\nAmy: From a neurobiological standpoint, Leonard, you may be alone because your psychological state is causing an actual pheromone-based stink of desperation.\nSheldon: Did you know that, Leonard?\nLeonard: No.\nSheldon: I did.\nAmy: I understand that some people find mates in social gathering places such as bars or taverns. Have you tried a bar or tavern?\nLeonard: No, I\xe2\x80\x99m not gonna try to pick up a woman in a bar.\nSheldon: Wise decision. You see, Amy, success at a bar is based on classic male attributes such as height, strength, attractiveness, the ability to hold one\xe2\x80\x99s liquor and throw darts, separately or together. Leonard has none of these attributes, right, Leonard?\nLeonard: Right.\nAmy: That\xe2\x80\x99s not true of all bars. Juice bars, for example.\nSheldon: Oh! Good point, Amy. Yeah, building on your premise, Leonard could frequent sushi bars, salad bars, oyster bars, the Apple Genius Bar, what are you doing?\nLeonard (exiting the apartment): Keep going. I\xe2\x80\x99m listening.\nAmy: That was rude.\nSheldon: He does it all the time. He\xe2\x80\x99s a cornucopia of social awkwardness.\nAmy: Cornucopia. What a mellifluous word.\nSheldon: Let\xe2\x80\x99s make that our word of the day.\nAmy: Agreed. And we\xe2\x80\x99ll use mellifluous tomorrow.\nSheldon: Well, I have to void my bladder. It was nice spending this time with you.\nAmy: Wait. I have a request.\nSheldon: Yes?\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99d like you to meet my mother.\nSheldon: I see. Can I get back to you on that?\nAmy: Certainly. Good night.\nSheldon: Good night. (Closing laptop, and running down stairs in panic) Leonard, Leonard, Leonard,\nLeonard, Leonard, Leonard, Leonard, Leonard, Leonard, Leonard, Leonard, Leonard, Leonard, Leonard, Leonard, Leonard, Leonard, Leonard, Leonard.\nLeonard: Yeah, what?\nSheldon: Amy Farrah Fowler has asked me to meet her mother.\nLeonard: Yeah. So?\nSheldon: What does that mean?\nLeonard: Well, you know how you\xe2\x80\x99re always saying that Amy is a girl who\xe2\x80\x99s your friend, and not your girlfriend?\nSheldon: Uh-huh.\nLeonard: You can\xe2\x80\x99t say that anymore.\nSheldon: Wait. What?\nLeonard: Look, she obviously wants to take your relationship to the next level.\nSheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t want the next level. I like this level. Fix it for me!\nLeonard: Me? Well, how am I supposed to fix it?\nSheldon: Simple! You want a girlfriend, Amy wants to be someone\xe2\x80\x99s girlfriend. Take her off my hands. I give you my blessing.\nLeonard: That is insane.\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re right. It would never work. Amy finds you tedious.\nLeonard: Okay, good luck.\nSheldon: Wait! What am I supposed to do?\nLeonard: Well, have you considered telling her how you feel?\nSheldon: Leonard, I\xe2\x80\x99m a physicist, not a hippie.\nLeonard: All right, well, let me see if I can explain your situation using physics. What would you be if you were attached to another object by an inclined plane wrapped helically around an axis?\nSheldon: Screwed.\nLeonard: There you go.\nSheldon: Amy\xe2\x80\x99s right. He is tedious.\nScene: Outside Howard\xe2\x80\x99s house. Leonard rings bell.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Howard, get the door!\nHoward (off): Why can\xe2\x80\x99t you get it?\nMrs Wolowitz (off): You know I\xe2\x80\x99m doing a bowel cleanse for my colonoscopy! I\xe2\x80\x99m like an upside-down volcano here.\nHoward: Oh, hey. I hope you didn\xe2\x80\x99t hear that.\nLeonard: The volcano thing? No.\nHoward: What\xe2\x80\x99s with the T-shirt? You working at the Apple store now?\nLeonard: No, it\xe2\x80\x99s just something I threw on.\nHoward: I know all your shirts. That\xe2\x80\x99s not one of them. You were pretending to work at the Genius Bar to pick up women, weren\xe2\x80\x99t you?\nLeonard: Yeah. Turns out, they guard the iPods, but they don\xe2\x80\x99t guard the shirts.\nHoward: So, how\xe2\x80\x99d it go?\nLeonard: It was going well. I was showing this super hot girl how to boot up in Safe Mode. The manager got suspicious, and, well, long story short, they really do have a little jail in the mall.\nHoward: Just FYI, don\xe2\x80\x99t try to go back with a fake moustache. I mean, they may not really be geniuses, but they see right through that.\nLeonard: I want to invoke the girlfriend pact, Howard.\nHoward: You that desperate?\nLeonard: No, I just, I want what you have. You know, I want a woman in my life.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Holy Moses, how much liquid can be in one tukus?\nLeonard: To be clear, I meant like Bernadette, not your mother.\nHoward: Yeah, I know what you mean.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m off to meet Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s friend. How do I look?\nSheldon: As if one of the plants from Invasion of the Body Snatchers duplicated you in every way, only with an absurd amount of hair gel.\nLeonard: What are you working on?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m removing my digital footprint from the Internet so Amy Farrah Fowler can\xe2\x80\x99t find me and compel me to meet her mother.\nLeonard: Ah, you\xe2\x80\x99re going off the grid.\nSheldon: Exactly.\nLeonard: The old Unabomber approach. Kudos.\nSheldon: Thank you. I\xe2\x80\x99ve also sent Amy a relationship termination notice and changed my cell phone number and e-mail address.\nLeonard: What if she just comes over?\nSheldon: She\xe2\x80\x99ll get lost. We no longer live at 2311 Los Robles. We now live at 311 Los Robles.\nLeonard: You changed the address on the building? What about mail?\nSheldon: Oh, no worries, I explained my predicament to our letter carrier. He was sympathetic. His exact words were, Got your back, Jack. Bitches be crazy.\nLeonard (there is a knock on the door): Who is it?\nAmy (off): Amy Farrah Fowler.\nSheldon: Darn! She found me!\nLeonard: She\xe2\x80\x99s been here before.\nSheldon: The only flaw in an otherwise perfect plan. Now, get my back, Jack.\nLeonard: What do you want to do?\nSheldon: Tell her I\xe2\x80\x99m not here.\nLeonard: Okay, where are you?\nSheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. You\xe2\x80\x99ll have to devise a scenario that plausibly explains my absence, keeping in mind that the key to a good lie lies in the details.\nLeonard: Hi, Amy. Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s not here.\nAmy: All right. (Leaves)\nSheldon: Way to go on the details.\nScene: A restaurant.\nLeonard: Thanks again for doing this, Bernadette.\nBernadette: Oh, I take pacts very seriously. One time at my lab, a petri dish of genetically modified super-virus went missing. That day we made a pinky swear never to admit we crossed Ebola with the common cold.\nHoward: Why the hell would you cross Ebola with the common cold?\nBernadette: We never did. That would be a terrible, terrible thing.\nGirl (arriving): Hi. Sorry I\xe2\x80\x99m late, I was at the gym. Spin class. Worked up quite a sweat.\nBernadette: Joy, this is Leonard. Leonard, this is Joy.\nLeonard: Hi.\nJoy: Hi. You don\xe2\x80\x99t look like a genius. Go ahead, say something smart.\nLeonard: Uh\xe2\x80\xa6\nJoy: Aah! Time\xe2\x80\x99s up. Just kidding. First thing you need to know about me, I\xe2\x80\x99m hilarious.\nLeonard: Yeah. So, Bernadette tells me she knows you from self-defence classes?\nJoy: Yeah. Israeli Krav Maga. Lots of fun. Basically, a hundred different ways to rip a guy\xe2\x80\x99s nuts off.\nLeonard: Wow. Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t think there\xe2\x80\x99d be that many.\nJoy: Number 42!\nLeonard: Whoa!\nBernadette: Isn\xe2\x80\x99t she a pip?\nScene: The stairwell.\nSheldon (rhythmically, while walking down the stairs): Proxima Centauri\xe2\x80\x99s the nearest star. The celestial bodies that follow are Alpha Centauri A, Toli, Barnard\xe2\x80\x99s Star, Wolf 359, Lalande 21185, Sirius A, Sirius B, BL-Ceti, UV-Ceti, Ross 154, Ross 248, Epsilon Eridani, Lac-9352, Ross 128, Procyon A, oh, darn, that\xe2\x80\x99s wrong! (Heads back up stairs) EZ Aquarii A, EZ Aquarii B, EZ Aquarii C, Procyon A. Those are the stars that are nearest to me. Tra-la-la and fiddle-dee-dee. (Sees Amy standing in lobby) Oh, dear. They really do be crazy.\nScene: The restaurant.\nJoy (burping): This lobster\xe2\x80\x99s good on the way down and the way up.\nLeonard: Should be, it\xe2\x80\x99s thirty dollars a pound.\nJoy: Hey, this is a date, right?\nLeonard: Yep, it is.\nJoy: 73!\nLeonard: Whoa!\nJoy: Excuse me, I have to go to the little girls\xe2\x80\x99 room and take a wicked whiz.\nBernadette: I\xe2\x80\x99ll go with you.\nJoy: Fair warning, I had the asparagus. My pee is gonna stink up the place.\nHoward: I think she likes you.\nScene: The stairwell. Amy is sitting on the bottom step.\nSheldon (wearing a heavy coat and false nose and glasses): EZ Aquarii B, EZ Aquarii C, excuse me, madam.\nAmy: Sheldon?\nSheldon: Rats!\nAmy: I believe a misunderstanding may have occurred when I asked you to meet my mother.\nSheldon: No misunderstanding. I\xe2\x80\x99ve learned what that request actually means, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be joined to another object by an inclined plane wrapped helically around an axis.\nAmy: In what way are you screwed? All I want to do is present you as my boyfriend to my mother so she\xe2\x80\x99ll be satisfied that I\xe2\x80\x99m in a relationship.\nSheldon: So we\xe2\x80\x99d be perpetrating a ruse?\nAmy: Precisely.\nSheldon: And you haven\xe2\x80\x99t fallen hopelessly in love with me?\nAmy: Don\xe2\x80\x99t be absurd. I find the notion of romantic love to be an unnecessary cultural construct that adds no value to human relationships.\nSheldon: Amy Farrah Fowler, that\xe2\x80\x99s the most pragmatic thing anyone has ever said to me.\nAmy: I trust this clarification allows us to return to boy-slash-friend-slash-girl-slash-friend status.\nSheldon: Of course. Would you like to join me for Chinese food?\nAmy: Sheldon, please, you\xe2\x80\x99re suffocating me.\nSheldon: My apologies. Good night, Amy.\nAmy: Good night, Sheldon.\nScene: The restaurant.\nHoward: Come on, just give her a chance. Maybe she\xe2\x80\x99ll grow on you.\nLeonard: Or maybe she\xe2\x80\x99ll finally succeed in ripping my nuts off. There are still 93 ways she hasn\xe2\x80\x99t tried yet. Look, Howard, I appreciate the effort, but this is, like, the worst date of my life.\nHoward: Seriously? I was once robbed by a pre-op transsexual I met on J-Date, and that didn\xe2\x80\x99t even crack my top ten.\nLeonard: I guess the difference is, I have some self-respect.\nHoward: Not that I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever seen.\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s relatively new. I just know that I\xe2\x80\x99m not gonna spend time with someone I don\xe2\x80\x99t like simply to have a girlfriend. I\xe2\x80\x99m okay on my own.\nJoy: Good news, I made lots of room for dessert.\nLeonard: Look, uh, Joy, it was nice to meet you, but\xe2\x80\xa6\nJoy: Yeah, you, too. Hey, you got anything for next weekend? I need a date for my cousin\xe2\x80\x99s wedding.\nLeonard: You\xe2\x80\x99re asking me out?\nJoy: Yeah. And it\xe2\x80\x99s an open bar, so I\xe2\x80\x99ll probably be giving it away.\nLeonard: I look forward to it.\nScene: The apartment.\nMrs Fowler (on webcam): It\xe2\x80\x99s nice to meet you, too, Sheldon. I honestly didn\xe2\x80\x99t believe Amy when she told me she had a boyfriend.\nSheldon: I assure you I am quite real and I\xe2\x80\x99m having regular intercourse with your daughter.\nMrs Fowler: What?\nSheldon: Oh, yes. We\xe2\x80\x99re like wild animals in heat. It\xe2\x80\x99s a wonder neither of us has been hurt.\nMrs Fowler: Amy, what is he saying?\nAmy: You wanted me to have a boyfriend, Mother. Well, here he is. Have to sign off now. My hunger for Sheldon is stirring in my loins.\nSheldon: Oh, yes, it\xe2\x80\x99s time for me to make love to your daughter\xe2\x80\x99s vagina.\nMrs Fowler: Oh!\nAmy: Thank you, Sheldon, that went very well.\nSheldon: Agreed. Amy, I find myself wondering if we should actually engage in coitus at least one time in our relationship. Bazinga. Bedtime. Please show yourself out.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
