b'Scene: The university cafeteria.\nHoward (on the phone): Yeah, I miss you, too, sweetie. Listen, I got to go, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll see you tonight? Okay. Bye-bye. Yeah, bye-bye. No, you hang up first. Hello?\nRaj: Dude, I\xe2\x80\x99m glad you finally got a girlfriend, but do you have to do all that lovey-dovey stuff in front of those of us who don\xe2\x80\x99t?\nSheldon: Actually, he might have to. There\xe2\x80\x99s an economic concept known as a positional good in which an object is only valued by the possessor because it\xe2\x80\x99s not possessed by others. The term was coined in 1976 by economist Fred Hirsch to replace the more colloquial, but less precise neener-neener.\nHoward: That\xe2\x80\x99s not true. My happiness is not dependent on my best friend being miserable and alone.\nRaj: Thank you.\nHoward: Although, I\xe2\x80\x99d be lying if I said it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a little bit of a perk.\nLeonard: Who\xe2\x80\x99s miserable and alone?\nRaj: Me.\nLeonard: Oh. I used to be like that. Then I got a girlfriend.\nSheldon: In pre-1976 terms, neener-neener.\nLeonard: Hey, what are you and Bernadette doing for your first Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s Day?\nHoward: Yeah, I am pulling out all the stops. There\xe2\x80\x99s a $39.95 lover\xe2\x80\x99s special at P.F. Chang\xe2\x80\x99s. Egg rolls, dumplings, bottomless wok, and you get your picture taken on the big marble horse out front.\nSheldon: Given that Saint Valentine was a third century Roman priest who was stoned and beheaded, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t a more appropriate celebration of the evening be taking one\xe2\x80\x99s steady gal to witness a brutal murder?\nHoward: I understand your point, but given a choice, Jews always go with Chinese food.\nRaj: Well, if anyone\xe2\x80\x99s interested, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be spending this Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s Day the same way I spend every Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s Day. Buying a rotisserie chicken from the supermarket, taking it home, standing over the sink and eating it out of the package with my bare hands like an animal.\nLeonard: Okay, so to sum up: one giant marble horse, one asinine comment, one lonely man and his chicken. And let\xe2\x80\x99s see, who\xe2\x80\x99s left? Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s right. My plans. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t anyone going to ask?\nRaj: Fine, tell us you\xe2\x80\x99re going to have sex with Penny.\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99s not what I was going to tell you.\nRaj: It\xe2\x80\x99s okay. I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind hearing about your sex life. It\xe2\x80\x99s his that bugs me.\nLeonard: Guess who the university is sending to Switzerland to attend a conference and see the CERN supercollider on February 14?\nSheldon: Professor Norton, although, God knows why. He hasn\xe2\x80\x99t published anything of note since he won that Nobel Prize.\nLeonard: Actually, Professor Norton can\xe2\x80\x99t make it. He threw his back out rock climbing.\nHoward: I heard he threw his back out climbing on his new girlfriend.\nRaj: The big-boobed weather girl on Channel 2?\nHoward: That\xe2\x80\x99s the one.\nLeonard: In any case, they\xe2\x80\x99re asking me to fill in for him.\nSheldon: In Switzerland or with the big-boobed weather girl?\nLeonard: Switzerland. And I get to bring a guest!\nHoward: Oh, man!\nRaj: No way, dude!\nSheldon: This is incredible! I\xe2\x80\x99m so happy, I\xe2\x80\x99m not even going to question their judgment in picking you. I\xe2\x80\x99m just going to run home and start packing.\nRaj: Why wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you take Penny?\nLeonard: I am taking Penny.\nRaj: Oh. Well, then I anticipate an awkward situation when you get home.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom.\nLeonard: Sheldon, you got a minute?\nSheldon: Of course, my good friend. Come in. Help me out, which ski hat says apr\xc3\xa8s supercollider?\nLeonard: Sheldon, I\xe2\x80\x99m not taking you to Switzerland.\nSheldon: Well, of course you are. Who else would you take?\nLeonard: Penny.\nSheldon: What? That\xe2\x80\x99s absurd. Penny has no interest in subatomic particle research.\nLeonard: Yes, but it\xe2\x80\x99ll be Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s Day. We can go sightseeing and skiing and make love in front of a roaring fire in the shadow of the snowcapped Alps.\nSheldon: But Penny has no interest in subatomic particle research.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Sorry? I\xe2\x80\x99ve been dreaming about going to the Large Hadron Collider since I was nine years old.\nLeonard: Yeah, well, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been dreaming about spending Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s Day with a girl since I was six.\nSheldon: Shame on you! That\xe2\x80\x99s no dream for a scientist!\nScene: The apartment.\nPenny: Okay, what\xe2\x80\x99s the big surprise?\nLeonard: Just a minute. This tray contains clues as to what you and I are going to be doing on Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s Day.\nPenny: Oh. Wow. Okay. Let\xe2\x80\x99s see. We\xe2\x80\x99ve got, uh, milk chocolate, Swiss cheese, fondue. My lactose-intolerant boyfriend is going to eat all this, then I\xe2\x80\x99m going to climb on his back and rocket to the moon?\nLeonard: No. But it does involve air travel. Okay, um, let me slice this Swiss cheese with my Swiss army knife, and then you can wash it down with a cup of Swiss Miss instant cocoa.\nPenny: Okay, I\xe2\x80\x99m starting to think Swiss is key here.\nLeonard: Uh-huh.\nPenny: We\xe2\x80\x99re going to Disneyland and ride the Matterhorn?\nLeonard: How does that involve air travel?\nPenny: We\xe2\x80\x99re going to Disney World and ride the Matterhorn?\nLeonard: No.\nPenny: Okay, sweetie, this started out fun, but I\xe2\x80\x99m over it.\nLeonard: We\xe2\x80\x99re going to Switzerland to see the CERN supercollider! And ski. We\xe2\x80\x99ll also go skiing.\nPenny: We\xe2\x80\x99re going skiing in Switzerland?!\nLeonard: Well, you\xe2\x80\x99ll ski, I\xe2\x80\x99ll fall, but, yeah, we will be in Switzerland for Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s Day.\nPenny: Oh, my God, Leonard! That\xe2\x80\x99s incredible!\nSheldon: Not so fast. You might want to hold off on lighting your rabeliechtli, Penny.\nPenny: My Rabe-what-ly?\nSheldon: Rabeliechtli. It means turnip light and refers to a traditional lantern hand-carved from a root vegetable and used to celebrate certain Swiss festivals. Which you will not be celebrating because, A, these festivals occur in the fall, and B, you will not be going to Switzerland.\nLeonard: Sheldon, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been through this. I\xe2\x80\x99m taking Penny.\nSheldon: Afraid not. Do you recognize this?\nLeonard: Not the roommate agreement.\nSheldon: Indeed, the roommate agreement. I call your attention to the Friendship Rider in Appendix C, Future Commitments. Number 37, in the event one friend is ever invited to visit the Large Hadron Collider, now under construction in Switzerland, he shall invite the other friend to accompany him.\nLeonard: Oh, for God\xe2\x80\x99s sakes.\nPenny: You actually put that in an agreement?\nLeonard: Yeah. We also put in what happens if one of us wins a MacArthur Grant, or if one of us gets superpowers, or if one of us is bitten by a zombie.\nSheldon: He can\xe2\x80\x99t kill me, even if I turn.\nPenny: Is there anything in there about if one of you gets a girlfriend?\nSheldon: No, that seemed a little farfetched.\nLeonard: Sheldon, do you really expect to enforce this?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99ve lived up to all my commitments under the agreement. At least once a day I ask how you are, even though I simply don\xe2\x80\x99t care. I no longer stage spontaneous biohazard drills after 10 pm And I abandoned my goal to master Tuvan throat singing.\nPenny: Okay, I know I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t ask, but what is\xe2\x80\xa6?\nLeonard: No.\nSheldon (after demonstrating): I\xe2\x80\x99d be much further along if I\xe2\x80\x99d been allowed to practice.\nLeonard: Look, Sheldon, I know it\xe2\x80\x99s in the agreement, and if you turn into a zombie, I promise I will not kill you. In fact, I\xe2\x80\x99ll even let you eat my brains. But I am taking Penny to Switzerland.\nSheldon: Is that your final decision?\nLeonard: It is.\nSheldon: Very well.\nPenny: It\xe2\x80\x99s not over, is it?\nLeonard: What do you think? (The sound of Tuvan throat singing comes from Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom.)\n  Scene: Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s car.\nLeonard: Got a bit of traffic this morning, huh? Think it\xe2\x80\x99s gonna rain? Instead of underpants, I covered my crotch with potato salad this morning. Thoughts? Okay, I know what\xe2\x80\x99ll cheer you up, let\xe2\x80\x99s play one of your driving games.\nSheldon: All right. This game is called Traitors. I will name three historical figures, you put them in order of the heinousness of their betrayal. Benedict Arnold, Judas, Dr. Leonard Hofstadter.\nLeonard: You really think I belong with Benedict Arnold and Judas?\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re right. Judas had the decency to hang himself after what he did.\nLeonard: Come on, Sheldon. Can\xe2\x80\x99t you at least try to understand how much this means to me?\nSheldon: Round two, Leonard Hofstadter, Darth Vader, Rupert Murdoch.\nLeonard: Rupert Murdoch?\nSheldon: He owns Fox, and they cancelled Firefly. Hint, he and Darth Vader are tied for number 2.\nScene: The university cafeteria.\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t hang with you last night. I had a date with Bernadette.\nRaj: I know. I saw the Tweet.\nHoward: So, what did you end up doing?\nRaj: Not much. Nuked a burrito. Prayed to the Hindu god Urvashi that your bowels would loosen and your penis would droop like a willow tree.\nLeonard: You seen Sheldon?\nRaj: No. Is he still mad about the supercollider?\nLeonard: Yeah. He thinks I betrayed him. I mean, come on, what would you guys do if you were me?\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99d take Sheldon to Switzerland.\nLeonard: Seriously?\nHoward: Absolutely. And I\xe2\x80\x99d leave him there. (Sheldon enters, puts a tray in front of Leonard, and exits.)\nRaj: What the hell is that?\nLeonard: Uh, let\xe2\x80\x99s see. Yup, 30 pieces of silverware.\nScene: Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom.\nSheldon: Morning, old chum.\nLeonard: What\xe2\x80\x99s going on?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99ve made you breakfast. Juice, coffee, and pancakes in the shape of some of your favorite fictional characters. See, here\xe2\x80\x99s Frodo.\nLeonard: You made Frodo pancakes?\nSheldon: Yeah, I used coconut shavings to do the hair on his feet. If you need to void your bladder before eating, I can keep them warm with this beret that I thoroughly laundered and pressed into service as a pancake cosy.\nLeonard: Why are you doing this?\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s by way of an apology for my recent behaviour. I\xe2\x80\x99ve had some time to reflect and I\xe2\x80\x99ve come to realize that friendship is not an aggregation of written agreements. It\xe2\x80\x99s a result of two people respecting and caring for each other. Butterscotch scone?\nLeonard: Thanks. It\xe2\x80\x99s good.\nSheldon: What you\xe2\x80\x99re tasting is respect and affection. And about a pound of Crisco. After you\xe2\x80\x99ve finished breakfast, I thought we could spend the day watching the final season of Babylon 5 with director commentary.\nLeonard: You hate Babylon 5.\nSheldon: I do. It fails as drama, science fiction, and it\xe2\x80\x99s hopelessly derivative. But you like it, and you\xe2\x80\x99re my friend.\nLeonard: Okay, great. Still not taking you to Switzerland.\nSheldon: Drat. No Frodo for you.\nScene: The laundry room.\nSheldon: Hello.\nPenny: Hello.\nSheldon: Alright, let\xe2\x80\x99s dispense with the friendly banter, I believe you know why I\xe2\x80\x99m here.\nPenny: Well, I always figured it was to study us, discover our weaknesses, and report back to your alien overlords.\nSheldon: Yes, amusing. Extraordinary intelligence might well appear extraterrestrial to you, but let me be more specific. I believe you know why I\xe2\x80\x99m here in the laundry room.\nPenny: Better acoustics for your throat singing?\nSheldon (trying it): It\xe2\x80\x99s actually not bad. But my true purpose in being here will be revealed in this brief PowerPoint presentation. Lights. Why Sheldon Cooper, PhD, should go to Switzerland to see the CERN supercollider. A PowerPoint presentation by Sheldon Cooper, PhD.\nPenny: Oh, for God\xe2\x80\x99s sakes.\nSheldon: Here we have a highly gifted researcher in the field of particle physics whose work has brought him to the precipice of forever changing mankind\xe2\x80\x99s understanding of the universe. AKA me. And here we have a waitress brushing her teeth with her finger. AKA you.\nPenny: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. Is this supposed to be buttering me up?\nSheldon: Please hold all questions to the end of the presentation. This is the Large Hadron Collider at CERN in Switzerland, the product of decades of planning and construction. It is a Mecca for physicists the world over. This is Bath and Body Works on Colorado Boulevard. They sell scented soaps and lotions, some of which contain glitter. Now, let\xe2\x80\x99s see if we can match the individual to the appropriate destination.\nPenny: Okay, show\xe2\x80\x99s over.\nSheldon: No, it\xe2\x80\x99s not. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got five more slides.\nPenny: Sheldon, this is Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s decision. He invited me to Switzerland, and I intend to go.\nSheldon: Very well. Enjoy yourself. You\xe2\x80\x99re going to be in the presence of something that I\xe2\x80\x99ve dreamed of seeing for decades. I just hope you\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to appreciate the magnitude of where you are and what it represents.\nPenny: I\xe2\x80\x99ll talk to Leonard.\nSheldon: You will?\nPenny: Yes. If it means that much to you, you should go.\nSheldon (Hugging her): Oh, Penny, thank you!\nPenny: You\xe2\x80\x99re welcome.\nSheldon: Since I rarely hug, I\xe2\x80\x99m relying on your expertise regarding duration.\nPenny: I think we\xe2\x80\x99re there.\nSheldon: Oh, good. Bye-bye.\nScene: The apartment.\nRaj: You know what? Even though I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a girlfriend, I can still have a good time on Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s Day.\nHoward: Trust me, you can\xe2\x80\x99t. I\xe2\x80\x99ve tried.\nRaj: No, no, no, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to have a me day. First I\xe2\x80\x99m going to go to one of those spas in Koreatown, take a steam and get a massage. Then I\xe2\x80\x99m going to stop at a pet store and get licked by puppies.\nLeonard: Sheldon, I need to talk to you.\nSheldon: All right, my friend. Would you like some cholermus?\nLeonard: Some what?\nSheldon: Cholermus. It\xe2\x80\x99s a traditional Swiss breakfast dish. I\xe2\x80\x99m preparing my gastrointestinal system for the exotic cuisine of Switzerland.\nLeonard: You\xe2\x80\x99re not going to Switzerland!\nSheldon: Oh, but I am. Didn\xe2\x80\x99t Penny tell you the good news?\nLeonard: She told me that you went behind my back to guilt her into letting you go instead of her.\nSheldon: Yes, that good news.\nLeonard: Well, forget it. I was the one who was invited, I get to decide who goes with me, and it\xe2\x80\x99s Penny, not you!\nSheldon: Howard, could you lower the lights? I have a short PowerPoint presentation.\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t need to see your presentation. This discussion is over!\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s a somewhat ambiguous response. Am I going or not?\nLeonard: Sheldon, at this point, I would go by myself before I would take you.\nSheldon: Really?\nLeonard: Yeah, really.\nSheldon: Well then, you leave me no alternative. From this moment forward, we can be roommates, but we will no longer be friends.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry you feel that way.\nSheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you\xe2\x80\x99re fully aware of the ramifications here, Leonard.\nLeonard: Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you enlighten me?\nSheldon: With the friendship clause of our roommate agreement nullified you are no longer entitled to accompany me to go swimming at Bill Gates\xe2\x80\x99 house should I be invited.\nHoward: Ooh, that\xe2\x80\x99s gotta sting.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom.\nLeonard: Just think, this time tomorrow we\xe2\x80\x99ll be in Geneva, Switzerland for our first Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s Day.\nPenny: I know! I went shopping today and bought special undies for the occasion.\nLeonard: Thermal? \xe2\x80\x98Cause it\xe2\x80\x99s gonna be cold.\nPenny: Think it through, Leonard.\nLeonard: Oh!\nPenny: Oh!\nLeonard (Penny sneezes): Gesundheit. Or as they say in Switzerland, gesundheit. You getting a cold?\nPenny: No, no, it\xe2\x80\x99s probably just allergies.\nLeonard: Do you want an allergy pill? \xe2\x80\x98Cause I have \xe2\x80\x99em all. Prescription, nonprescription, foreign, domestic, experimental.\nPenny: Do any of them work?\nLeonard: Not really, I\xe2\x80\x99m just an enthusiast.\n(Time passes. Sound of Penny retching in the bathroom)\nLeonard: Penny? You okay?\nPenny: Did that sound okay to you? Do not come in here!\nLeonard: What\xe2\x80\x99s going on?\nPenny: I\xe2\x80\x99m having a tea party. What do you think\xe2\x80\x99s going on? I think I might have the flu. Or the plague.\nLeonard: Well, our plane leaves at 9 a.m. Do you think you\xe2\x80\x99ll feel better by then?\nPenny: Yep. \xe2\x80\x98Cause I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna be dead.\nScene: Outside Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom.\nLeonard: Hey, Sheldon? Listen, Penny is pretty sick and she\xe2\x80\x99s not going to be able to go to Switzerland. So if you\xe2\x80\x99re still interested, you\xe2\x80\x99re welcome to come. (Sound of Sheldon vomiting in the bathroom)\nSheldon: Great. I\xe2\x80\x99ll start packing. In a minute. (Vomits again) Oh, look, it\xe2\x80\x99s the cholermus.\nScene: The apartment.\n  Penny: Here\xe2\x80\x99s your soup.\nSheldon: Chicken?\nPenny: Yes.\nSheldon: With the little stars?\nPenny: Yes.\nSheldon: Heated to 180 degrees?\nPenny: Why don\xe2\x80\x99t I pour it in your lap, and you can tell me.\nSheldon: You don\xe2\x80\x99t have to be mean. I\xe2\x80\x99m sick.\nPenny: Yeah, well, I\xe2\x80\x99m sick, too.\nSheldon: Not my problem. I just don\xe2\x80\x99t understand how this happened to me. I\xe2\x80\x99m scrupulous about my hygiene. I regularly disinfect my hands, and I avoid contact with other people on general principle.\nPenny: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to tell you, Sheldon.\nSheldon (remembering the hug): It\xe2\x80\x99s you! I touched you!\nPenny: Happy Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s Day.\nScene: A Swiss hotel room.\nRaj: Oh, my goodness, look at this room! Champagne! Roses! Oh, and little chocolates! This is going to be the best Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s Day ever.\nLeonard: Yeah, I forgot about all this.\nRaj: But I never will.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
