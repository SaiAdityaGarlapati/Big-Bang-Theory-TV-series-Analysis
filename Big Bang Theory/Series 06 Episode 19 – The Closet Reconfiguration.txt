b'Scene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nBernadette: What you doing?\nHoward: You said clean up. I\xe2\x80\x99m cleaning up.\nBernadette: You can\xe2\x80\x99t just throw everything in the closet.\nHoward: Hey, you can tell me what to do or you can tell me how to do it, but you can\xe2\x80\x99t do both. This isn\xe2\x80\x99t sex.\nBernadette: What if someone looks in there?\nHoward: They\xe2\x80\x99re just coming over for dinner. No one\xe2\x80\x99s gonna look in the closet.\nBernadette: Well, you don\xe2\x80\x99t know that. What if someone\xe2\x80\x99s looking for the bathroom and they open that door?\nHoward: Could work out. For all we know there\xe2\x80\x99s a toilet in there somewhere.\nBernadette: Fine. But after tonight we need to get a handle on this mess.\nHoward: You know what we should do? We should show the closet to Sheldon.\nBernadette: Why?\nHoward: Are you kidding? He\xe2\x80\x99s like a savant at organizing. Everything in his apartment has a label on it. Including his label maker, which has a label that says label maker. And if you look really close at that label maker label, you\xe2\x80\x99ll see a label that says label.\nBernadette: He\xe2\x80\x99s our guest, we can\xe2\x80\x99t just ask him to straighten our closet.\nHoward: No, we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t ask him. We\xe2\x80\x99d just show him the closet and let the goblins in his head take it from there.\nLater.\nHoward: Hey, guys, come on in.\nAll: Hi.\nPenny: Ooh, it smells good.\nBernadette: Thanks. And, Sheldon, I know tonight\xe2\x80\x99s the night you eat Thai food, so I went to the Asian market, got all the ingredients and made it from scratch.\nSheldon: Oh, you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have.\nBernadette: Oh, it\xe2\x80\x99s my pleasure.\nSheldon: No, you really shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have. I brought my own.\nBernadette: You stopped and got him takeout?\nLeonard: I had no choice. He kept kicking the back of my seat.\nBernadette: Sheldon, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been cooking all day.\nSheldon: Well, now don\xe2\x80\x99t you feel silly.\nBernadette: Show him the closet.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nRaj: These spring rolls are amazing. Good job, Bernadette.\nBernadette: That\xe2\x80\x99s the takeout that Sheldon brought.\nRaj: Oh, well, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have tasted nearly as good if I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t tried your food first.\nSheldon: Howard, did you want your clothes arranged seasonally or by colour?\nHoward: Colour\xe2\x80\x99s fine.\nSheldon: Wrong, they\xe2\x80\x99ll be arranged seasonally.\nPenny: Sheldon, aren\xe2\x80\x99t you gonna spend a little time with Amy?\nAmy: Oh, it\xe2\x80\x99s okay, I\xe2\x80\x99m used to it. The other day at Whole Foods, he spent an hour optimizing the cheese aisle.\nSheldon: Yeah, and some thanks I got. The assistant manager chased me out with an artisanal salami.\nAmy: His quirks just make you love him more. Someone please agree with me.\nScene: The closet.\nLeonard: Sheldon, come on. It\xe2\x80\x99s getting late. Time to go.\nSheldon: Oh, five more minutes.\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99s what you said five minutes ago. Amy and Penny are already in the car. Let\xe2\x80\x99s move it.\nSheldon: How come I never get to do anything I want to do?\nHoward: You know, if he really wants to stay and finish, I can give him a ride home.\nSheldon: Please, Leonard, he said it\xe2\x80\x99s okay.\nLeonard: Sheldon, it\xe2\x80\x99s, wait, I can go home without you? Bye.\nSheldon: Howard, I have a few questions. I found three bowling pins. Now, do you juggle these, or are you missing seven?\nHoward: Juggle.\nSheldon: You health nuts kill me.\nBernadette: Oh, my God, it\xe2\x80\x99s beautiful. Look, he found the juggling pins I hid.\nSheldon: Uh, just a couple more items. Howard, I found this letter from your dad in a box. Now, based on the content, it could either be filed\xe2\x80\xa6\nHoward: Whoa, you opened this?\nSheldon: Well, I had to find out if it was personal correspondence or memorabilia. Now, as I was saying, based on the content\xe2\x80\xa6\nHoward: I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be less interested. Now, come on, I\xe2\x80\x99ll take you home.\nBernadette: Howard, don\xe2\x80\x99t you want to know what\xe2\x80\x99s in the letter?\nHoward: If I wanted to know, I would\xe2\x80\x99ve opened it years ago. The closet looks great. Let\xe2\x80\x99s get out of here.\nSheldon: Wait, can I bring this box of extra shirt buttons to sort on the ride?\nHoward: Do whatever you want.\nSheldon: Thanks. Oh. Great party.\nScene: The stairwell.\nLeonard: You know, when I first met Howard, he would pull his scrotum out of his shorts and say, aw, I sat in gum.\nPenny: What is your point?\nLeonard: Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s just kind of weird how grown up he is now. Happily married guy throwing dinner parties.\nPenny: Really? You couldn\xe2\x80\x99t just say that? You had to tell the scrotum story?\nLeonard: Trying to paint a picture.\nPenny: It was a nice change of pace not eating takeout around a coffee table.\nLeonard: Mm, you know, we could throw a dinner party, too. Maybe even ask everyone to get dressed up.\nPenny: Sure. Just, when you say dressed up, you mean nice clothes, right? Not, like, capes and tights and crap?\nLeonard: Yeah. Although\xe2\x80\xa6\nPenny: No.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nBernadette: Howie, you okay?\nHoward: Yeah, I just couldn\xe2\x80\x99t sleep.\nBernadette: Told you you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have espresso after dinner. I know the little cups make you feel big, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not worth it.\nHoward: It\xe2\x80\x99s this stupid letter.\nBernadette: Did you read it?\nHoward: No.\nBernadette: You must be curious.\nHoward: Of course I\xe2\x80\x99m curious. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen the man since, oh, I was a little kid. And a letter shows up on my 18th birthday? What\xe2\x80\x99s that about?\nBernadette: Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you read it? Maybe he apologizes or explains why he left.\nHoward: He abandoned me and my mother. Why does he deserve a chance to explain anything?\nBernadette: I get that. So, what do you want to do with it?\nHoward: Something I should have done a long time ago. (Sets fire to it)\nBernadette: Really? Are you sure?\nHoward: Yep.\nBernadette: Feel better?\nHoward: I do. (Smoke alarm goes off) Great. Neither one of us is tall enough to reach that.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nAmy: I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe he set it on fire.\nBernadette: Yeah, just seeing that letter really freaked him out. And he was already having a tough day \xe2\x80\x99cause he accidentally wore my pants to work. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why he was upset. They were bigger on him than me.\nAmy: Boy, I\xe2\x80\x99m really curious what was in that letter.\nBernadette: Me, too, but I guess now we\xe2\x80\x99ll never know.\nAmy: Well, you said Sheldon read it. Why not ask him?\nBernadette: I can\xe2\x80\x99t do that. What kind of wife would I be if I didn\xe2\x80\x99t respect my husband\xe2\x80\x99s privacy?\nPenny: What if I ask Sheldon, you just happen to be in the room?\nBermadette: That works.\nPenny: Okay.\nScene: The laundry room.\nSheldon: Bleuch. Like cleaning out the entire building\xe2\x80\x99s belly button.\nPenny: Hey, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Oh, hello. What can I do for you ladies?\nAmy: You have something we want.\nSheldon: Oh, dear. My mother warned me this is what happens to pretty boys in the big city.\nPenny: No, we just want information.\nSheldon: Oh. Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got that in spades. Ravage me.\nPenny: We heard you read the letter from Howard\xe2\x80\x99s father.\nSheldon: I did.\nPenny: What did it say?\nSheldon: I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell you that. I\xe2\x80\x99m bound by closet organizer/organizee confidentiality.\nAmy: Sheldon, that\xe2\x80\x99s not a real thing.\nSheldon: Well, neither is the rule that you have to hold your girlfriend\xe2\x80\x99s hand at the movies. You know. That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t stop you from pawing at me like you\xe2\x80\x99re a bear and I\xe2\x80\x99m a trash can full of sweets.\nPenny: Why do you even care? Just tell us what it says.\nSheldon: Control over the information contained in that letter belongs to Howard. By happenstance, I came to know it. That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t give me the right to disseminate it freely.\nPenny: Come on. Look, the letter was found in Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s closet. Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t that count for something?\nSheldon: Are you pointing out that California is a community property state, and since Howard and Bernadette are married, the intellectual property contained in that letter is jointly owned by the two spouses?\nPenny: Yeah, obviously.\nSheldon: Well played. Sometimes I don\xe2\x80\x99t give you enough credit, Penny.\nScene: The apartment.\nRaj: Dude, you made the right choice coming to me for help with this party.\nLeonard: Actually, all I did was invite you.\nRaj: Well, put your mind at ease. I\xe2\x80\x99m here to make sure your dinner party kicks Howard\xe2\x80\x99s dinner party\xe2\x80\x99s ass. Now, the first thing we need is a theme. I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking, ah, turn-of-the-century Moulin Rouge.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking you need a testosterone patch. Penny and I just want to do something low-key. You know, cocktails, light jazz music, hors d\xe2\x80\x99oeuvres.\nRaj: So your theme is I saw a rerun of Mad Men and bought some crab puffs from Trader Joe\xe2\x80\x99s? Hate to miss that.\nLeonard: Hey, where have you been?\nSheldon: Oh, Leonard. If I was prone to sarcasm, I\xe2\x80\x99d say I was pulling off a major heist at the museum of laundry baskets.\nLeonard: One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. I meant, golly, Sheldon, you\xe2\x80\x99ve been gone a long time.\nSheldon: Oh. Yeah, well, I was waylaid by Penny, Bernadette and Amy. They made me reveal confidential information about Howard\xe2\x80\x99s father.\nLeonard: What information?\nSheldon: I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell you that. I am bound by closet organizer/organizee confidentiality.\nRaj: Well, come on, we won\xe2\x80\x99t tell anyone.\nSheldon: Sorry, badgering me won\xe2\x80\x99t work. What you should have said is, It\xe2\x80\x99s pointless to keep this a secret because Penny will tell us.\nLeonard: Fine, then that.\nSheldon: All right, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you. My goodness, everyone\xe2\x80\x99s on their game today.\nScene: The apartment kitchen.\nAmy: This is really fun.\nRaj: Yeah, it\xe2\x80\x99s nice to get dressed up once in a while.\nPenny: Yeah, and the hors d\xe2\x80\x99oeuvres are delightful.\nLeonard: As is the company.\nPenny: Aw.\nSheldon: My shirt is itchy and I wish I were dead.\nLeonard: Hey, uh, listen, everybody. Before Howard gets here, et\xe2\x80\x99s all just agree to not bring up the letter from his father.\nRaj: Of course.\nPenny: Sure.\nAmy: Absolutely.\nSheldon: If I say yes, can we turn off that Latin orgy music?\nScene: The stairwell.\nHoward: Ridiculous that we still have to walk up all these flights of stairs.\nBernadette: Yeah, try doing it in heels.\nHoward: I am.\nBernadette: Wait. There\xe2\x80\x99s something I have to tell you.\nHoward: What?\nBernadette: I know what was in your dad\xe2\x80\x99s letter.\nHoward: Sheldon, I swear to God, I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna kill you.\nAmy: Hey.\nBernadette: I made him tell us.\nHoward: What? Us? Who else knows?\nPenny: I know.\nAmy: Me, too.\nLeonard: Same here.\nRaj: Shame on all of you.\nLeonard: You know, too.\nRaj: Couldn\xe2\x80\x99t leave him one friend, could you?\nHoward: So everybody knows what\xe2\x80\x99s in that letter except for me?\nSheldon: Yes, it\xe2\x80\x99s six against one. Stand down, sir.\nHoward: How could you do this?\nBernadette: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.\nRaj: If you want, we could tell you.\nHoward: No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to know. I mean, I do, but\xe2\x80\xa6 I got to go.\nAmy: Use me as a human shield!\nSheldon: I panicked. He looked taller than usual.\nScene: The closet.\nBernadette (off): Howard?\nHoward: In here.\nBernadette: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. I should have left it alone.\nHoward: It\xe2\x80\x99s okay. Sorry I ran off like that.\nBernadette: What are you looking at?\nHoward: Uh, pictures of my dad and me when I was a kid.\nBernadette: That\xe2\x80\x99s nice.\nHoward: I got to tell you, as angry as I am at Sheldon for blabbing, he did a hell of a job organizing this closet. Look at this. Photos of Wolowitz family before father left forever. Check out nine-year-old Howie with cornrows. Neither race was happy to see me with those.\nBernadette: Think you could take a break?\nHoward: Why?\nBernadette: Got a little surprise for you. Come on.\nHoward: Oh, honey, I am in no mood to have sex tonight. I\xe2\x80\x99ll lay there if you absolutely have to have it, but\xe2\x80\xa6 Oh. What are you guys doing here?\nLeonard: When you left, you weren\xe2\x80\x99t sure whether or not you wanted to know what was in your dad\xe2\x80\x99s letter, so we came up with kind of a cool solution.\nHoward: Oh, yeah, what\xe2\x80\x99s that?\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s simple, really. It occurred to me that knowing and not knowing can be achieved by creating a macroscopic example of quantum superposition. The, the principle that a physical system exists partially in all its possible states at once.\nPenny: We were all thinking it, really. It was kind of the elephant in the room, so\xe2\x80\xa6\nSheldon: Anyway, um, I realized that if we each present you with an account of what your father wrote to you, only one of which is true, and then we don\xe2\x80\x99t tell you which one it is, you will forever be in a state of epistemic ambivalence.\nPenny: Yeah. And I said if it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t epistemic, we might as well not do it.\nBernadette: Sit down, honey.\nLeonard: Raj, you\xe2\x80\x99re up.\nRaj: Okay, um, It was a card for your 18th birthday. Inside it said, Happy birthday, Howard. I love you. Dad. Oh, and it was a Far Side card, the one where the frog has its tongue stuck to the underside of an airplane. Thinks it\xe2\x80\x99s a fly. Silly frog. So funny.\nLeonard: Sheldon.\nSheldon: It was a map leading to the lost treasure of famous pirate One-Eyed Willy.\nHoward: Nice try. That\xe2\x80\x99s the plot for Goonies.\nAmy: Told you.\nSheldon: Don\xe2\x80\x99t.\nLeonard: Amy.\nAmy: You didn\xe2\x80\x99t know it, but your father was in the auditorium at your high school graduation. And he cried because he was so proud of you.\nHoward: Really?\nSheldon: Or that\xe2\x80\x99s complete poppycock which Amy made up. It still could be the map.\nLeonard: Penny.\nPenny: It was a letter explaining that your dad wasn\xe2\x80\x99t who he said he was. Eventually, his other life caught up to him, and the only way to keep you and your mom safe was to leave.\nSheldon: I would like to change mine. The pirate\xe2\x80\x99s name was Peg-Leg Antoine. Now it\xe2\x80\x99s completely different from Goonies.\nAmy: No, it\xe2\x80\x99s not.\nSheldon: Don\xe2\x80\x99t.\nLeonard: Okay, my turn. Your dad wrote about how family is the most important thing, and that you should never throw it away like he did.\nHoward: Hmm.\nLeonard: Bernadette.\nBernadette: Inside the envelope was a picture of your dad holding you the day you were born. On the back he wrote Howard, my son, my greatest gift. You okay?\nHoward: Yeah. I\xe2\x80\x99m terrific.\nLeonard: So, which one do you think it is, matey?\nHoward: Actually, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to know. I want all of them to be true.\nLeonard: Well, one of them is.\nHoward: That\xe2\x80\x99s pretty cool. Thank you, guys.\nPenny: Hey, it\xe2\x80\x99s still early. Why don\xe2\x80\x99t we go back and have that party?\nRaj: Yeah,\nLeonard: Yeah, cool.\nAmy: Okay.\nSheldon: You know, surprisingly, uh, the letter from your father wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the most interesting thing I read in the closet. Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s diary has some saucy passages.\nBernadette: Sheldon, don\xe2\x80\x99t you dare.\nSheldon: There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to worry about. Your secret\xe2\x80\x99s safe with me.\nBernadette: That\xe2\x80\x99s more like it.\nSheldon: Although copyright law would allow me to quote snippets in the context of a review.\nScene: The apartment.\nBernadette: Glad you\xe2\x80\x99re feeling better.\nHoward: Me, too. If I\xe2\x80\x99d known we were gonna be dancing, would have worn my flats.\nPenny: This turned out pretty well, huh?\nLeonard: Yeah, I think so.\nRaj: I agree. That is, if you\xe2\x80\x99ve never been to or heard of a party before.\nAmy: If you\xe2\x80\x99d let me pierce your brain with a hot needle in the right place, you\xe2\x80\x99d be happy all the time.\nSheldon: Uh, Penny, I, I have a couple of questions about your closet. Is there any reason you\xe2\x80\x99re keeping this dead goldfish?\nPenny: Damn, I forgot to feed him. And that I had him.\nSheldon: Well, now, did you also have a dog? Because I found what appears to be a battery-operated chew toy.\nPenny: Party\xe2\x80\x99s over! Party\xe2\x80\x99s over!\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
