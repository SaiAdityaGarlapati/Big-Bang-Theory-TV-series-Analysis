b'Scene: The paintball range.\nHoward: That was close.\nRaj: God, I love the smell of paintballs in the morning.\nHoward: Yeah, still funny, Raj.\nLeonard: There\xe2\x80\x99s no way we can get to the ridge. The Chemistry Department has us completely cut off.\nHoward: But what about the creek bed?\nSheldon: The Pharmacology Department controls that, and they\xe2\x80\x99re all hopped up on experimental steroids.\nRaj: Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s it then, we\xe2\x80\x99re doomed.\nSheldon: I think the time has come to acknowledge that we are paying the price for some of us failing to attend my Physics Department paintball strategy meeting.\nHoward: I told you my mom has spider veins, I had to take her to the laser clinic.\nSheldon: And I told you I wanted to see a doctor\xe2\x80\x99s note.\nRaj: We need a plan. How about Operation Hammer of the Gods?\nLeonard: I forget. Which one is Hammer of the Gods?\nRaj: We hide behind the Dumpsters in the parking lot and ambush people when they come to pee.\nHoward: No go. The Dumpsters are deep in Astronomy Department territory.\nLeonard: No, that shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be a problem, Venus is up during the day. They\xe2\x80\x99re probably just all staring at the sky.\nSheldon: All right, what we need now is a tactical retreat. Did you see the episode of Stargate where they found themselves on a planet with a culture based loosely on Earth\xe2\x80\x99s Athens and Sparta? Not important. Leonard, Raj and I are going to burst out the door and run away, Howard will cover us.\nHoward: Why don\xe2\x80\x99t I run away and you cover me?\nSheldon: Because you chose your mother\xe2\x80\x99s veins over victory. On three. One, two, three, go!\nHoward: I had to take her! It\xe2\x80\x99s almost bathing suit weather!(Another player bursts through the door)\nI surrender! Don\xe2\x80\x99t shoot! They went that way!\nLeslie: Howard, I\xe2\x80\x99m on your team.\nHoward: Oh, Leslie, thank God.\nLeslie: Where\xe2\x80\x99s the rest of your squad?\nHoward: Ah, they left me here to die. What about yours?\nLeslie: Dead, all of them.\nHoward: Sorry.\nLeslie: Don\xe2\x80\x99t be. It was friendly fire. They just wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t listen.\nHoward: Well, we\xe2\x80\x99re surrounded, so I guess there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing for us to do but wait to be captured or killed.\nLeslie: Hmm, that\xe2\x80\x99s the worst part, the waiting.\nHoward: All the while knowing that there\xe2\x80\x99s a paint pellet out there with your name on it.\nLeslie: Yeah, the big wet ball of death. Kind of makes you feel more alive, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\nHoward: It kind of does.\nLeslie: I say we make every moment count.\nHoward: I agree. How exactly do we do that? (Leslie kisses him)\nLeonard (voice): Howard, why aren\xe2\x80\x99t you covering us? We\xe2\x80\x99re getting slaughtered out here!\nHoward: War is hell.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The university cafeteria.\nRaj: Did you guys see the new budget memo that went out this morning?\nLeonard: Yeah, more cutbacks.\nSheldon: Unacceptable. It baffles me why they don\xe2\x80\x99t simply let some of you go so that there\xe2\x80\x99s money available for my research.\nLeonard: You know what baffles me, Sheldon?\nSheldon: Based on your academic record, any number of things, I would imagine.\nLeslie: Hey, guys.\nLeonard: Hey, Leslie.\nHoward: Hey.\nLeslie: Howard, I got the approval for the rapid prototyper you wanted.\nHoward: That\xe2\x80\x99s great, Leslie. Thanks.\nLeslie: You scratch my back, I scratch yours. Rawr.\nRaj: What was all that about?\nHoward: Oh, uh, no big deal. They gave Leslie control of some unrestricted grant money.\nLeonard: Yeah, okay, but what\xe2\x80\x99s with the back-scratching and the meow!\nSheldon: I believe the back-scratching metaphor generally describes a quid pro quo situation where one party provides goods or services to the second party in compensation for a similar action.\nLeonard: Thank you.\nSheldon: The mrow, that sounded to me like an African civet cat.\nLeonard: Are you done?\nSheldon: No. Despite what the name suggests, the civet cat is not a true cat. Now I\xe2\x80\x99m done.\nRaj: You know what I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking? I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking Howard wasn\xe2\x80\x99t making a back-scratching metaphor. I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking there was some actual scratching involved.\nLeonard: What about it, Howard?\nHoward: Okay, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to say anything \xe2\x80\x99cause I know you and Leslie have a little history.\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t care about that.\nHoward: Great, \xe2\x80\x99cause I\xe2\x80\x99ve been dying to say something.\nLeonard: You and Leslie?\nHoward: In the paintball shed! Twice!\nSheldon: Is that why you didn\xe2\x80\x99t cover our escape and let us get cut down like animals?\nHoward: Oh, yeah, sorry about that.\nSheldon: My good man, dereliction of duty in the face of the enemy is a court-martial offense.\nHoward: Court-martial, schmort-martial, Leslie Winkle is the fifth girl I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever had sex with. I mean, for free.\nRaj: And plus, you got a rapid prototyper. That\xe2\x80\x99s an expensive piece of equipment, dude.\nLeonard: And the rest of us have had our budgets cut to the bone.\nHoward: Okay, one way to look at this is that I\xe2\x80\x99m getting new equipment, and you\xe2\x80\x99re not, and that\xe2\x80\x99s unfair. But a better way to look at this is that I\xe2\x80\x99m getting sex and you\xe2\x80\x99re not, and that\xe2\x80\x99s delightful.\nScene: The apartment. Leonard is looking at Penny\xe2\x80\x99s laptop.\nPenny: The whole thing froze. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what happened.\nLeonard: Calm down. We\xe2\x80\x99ll figure it out.\nPenny: How can I calm down? I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna lose my whole shopping cart. That\xe2\x80\x99s three hours of picking out shoes just shot to hell.\nSheldon: Hello, Penny.\nPenny: Hello, Sheldon.\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re in my spot.\nPenny: Are you planning on sitting here?\nSheldon: No, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to the comic book store.\nPenny: Then what difference does it make?\nSheldon: What difference does it make?\nLeonard: Here we go.\nSheldon: That is my spot. In an ever-changing world, it is a single point of consistency. If my life were expressed as a function on a four-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system, that spot at the moment I first sat on it would be zero-zero-zero-zero.\nPenny: What?\nLeonard: Don\xe2\x80\x99t sit in his spot.\nPenny: Fine. (Moves) Happy?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m not unhappy.\nPenny: Boy, I love him, but he is one serious wackadoodle.\nLeonard: Okay, that should do it.\nPenny: Oh, thank you. You are a lifesaver.\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of shoes you ordered.\nPenny: Yeah, you know the sad thing is, it\xe2\x80\x99s really not. Ooh, is this one of those paintball guns?\nLeonard: Yeah. You ought to come out with us sometime.\nPenny: Oh, no, thanks. I\xe2\x80\x99m from Nebraska. When we shoot things, it\xe2\x80\x99s because we want to eat them or make them leave our boyfriends alone. (Gun goes off and shoots three paint pellets onto Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s spot.)\nScene: Howard\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom.\nLeslie: Boy, your heart\xe2\x80\x99s racing. I must\xe2\x80\x99ve really gotten you going.\nHoward: Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s partly you, partly my transient idiopathic arrhythmia.\nLeslie: Sexy.\nHoward: Can I assume that you likewise found the experience\xe2\x80\xa6\nLeslie: Satisfactory?\nHoward: That wasn\xe2\x80\x99t quite the word I was looking for, but sure, I\xe2\x80\x99ll do this pass-fail.\nLeslie: Hey, are you enjoying that prototyper I got you?\nHoward: Oh, it\xe2\x80\x99s great. Everybody in the Engineering Department is eating their hearts out.\nLeslie: Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it nice when your good fortune makes others miserable?\nHoward: You know, most people don\xe2\x80\x99t get that.\nHoward\xe2\x80\x99s Mother (voice): Howard, I\xe2\x80\x99m home!\nHoward: Oh, great.\nHoward\xe2\x80\x99s Mother (voice): Book club was cancelled! That thing on Phyllis\xe2\x80\x99s neck opened up again!\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m busy, Ma!\nHoward\xe2\x80\x99s Mother (voice): Too busy to help your mother with her zipper?\nHoward: Don\xe2\x80\x99t come in, Ma!\nHoward\xe2\x80\x99s Mother (voice): Why not?\nLeslie: He\xe2\x80\x99s got company!\nHoward: Oh, there\xe2\x80\x99s the arrhythmia.\nHoward\xe2\x80\x99s Mother (voice): Is she Jewish?\nHoward: Are you Jewish?\nLeslie: No.\nHoward: Yes!\nHoward\xe2\x80\x99s Mother (voice): Okay, then you kids have fun! Use protection!\nScene: The apartment. Leonard is trying to wash the paint off Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s seat.\nPenny: You think he\xe2\x80\x99ll notice?\nLeonard: There\xe2\x80\x99s a chance.\nPenny: Oh, what are we gonna do?\nLeonard: We? No, no, no, you had your chance to be we for, like, a year and a half now. Right now, you are you, and you are screwed.\nPenny: Why do we have to tell him I did it?\nLeonard: Well, we\xe2\x80\x99re not gonna tell him I did it.\nPenny: Okay, okay, how about this? We tell him somebody broke in.\nLeonard: Just to shoot the couch with a paintball gun?\nPenny: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, I buy it. All those people are on drugs.\nLeonard: We could tell him they wanted the couch to stay away from their boyfriend.\nPenny: Okay, fine. Well, what if we just flip it over? There. Looks fine, right?\nLeonard: Mm, butt print. There\xe2\x80\x99s no discernible butt print.\nPenny: Oh, come on. (Sits and wriggles around) There, butt print.\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s too small and too perfect.\nPenny: Thank you.\nLeonard: You\xe2\x80\x99re welcome.\nPenny (as Sheldon enters): Shh! Act normal.\nLeonard: Sheldon! How was the comic book store?\nSheldon: Fine. The new issue of Flash is out.\nLeonard: Great, great. Did you walk the whole way? It\xe2\x80\x99s a little chilly.\nSheldon: Koothrappali picked me up.\nLeonard: Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that terrific? He is such a good friend. You know what the best thing about friends is?\nSheldon: They don\xe2\x80\x99t talk incessantly for no particular reason.\nLeonard: No, no, friends forgive the little things.\nPenny: You know, I gotta go home and wash my hair.\nLeonard: Don\xe2\x80\x99t you dare, missy.\nSheldon: Hello, fastest man alive. Want to see me read your entire comic book? Want to see it again? Something\xe2\x80\x99s wrong.\nLeonard: What do you mean?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t feel right.\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about. Oh, that. Penny did that.\nScene: The same. Everyone is eating. Sheldon is perched on the back of Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s chair. He keeps making moaning noises. Saying \xe2\x80\x9cExcuse me\xe2\x80\x9d he tries moving back to his spot, but the cushion is not there. He tries perching on the arm in various positions.\nLeonard: Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you just eat in your desk chair?\nSheldon: Why don\xe2\x80\x99t I just eat in my desk chair?\nPenny: Here we go.\nSheldon: That is my desk chair, that is where I work. I don\xe2\x80\x99t eat in my desk chair and I don\xe2\x80\x99t work in my spot. I work in my desk chair and eat in my spot.\nLeonard: Wackadoodle.\nHoward: You know, there\xe2\x80\x99s kind of an obvious solution here. (To Raj) Get up. (Raj does. Howard moves his cushion across to Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s spot) There. Problem solved. (Raj whispers to him) Nobody cares where you\xe2\x80\x99re going to sit. You\xe2\x80\x99re not crazy.\nSheldon: Excuse me, but the problem is not solved. If your head had been accidentally amputated, and we transplanted a dog\xe2\x80\x99s head in its place, would that be \xe2\x80\x9cproblem solved\xe2\x80\x9d?\nLeonard: If it were your head, it would be.\nPenny: Sheldon, I am really, really sorry, but it\xe2\x80\x99s only for a week. Can\xe2\x80\x99t you be a little bit flexible? Yeah, sorry. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t really think that through.\nSheldon: You claim it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a week, but I have no faith in your dry cleaner.\nPenny: Why not?\nSheldon: Did you notice the sign on his counter? He\xe2\x80\x99s not a full-time dry cleaner. He also makes keys.\nLeonard: Oh, for God\xe2\x80\x99s sake, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Focus is important. Was Michael DeBakey a wedding planner in between heart transplants? Did Alexander Fleming moonlight as a hairdresser? \xe2\x80\x9cThanks for discovering penicillin, now how about we try a bouffant?\xe2\x80\x9d\nHoward (after his phone rings): Ooh, looks like I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna have sex tonight. Hey, baby\xe2\x80\xa6\nPenny: His right hand is calling him?\nLeonard: No, it\xe2\x80\x99s Leslie Winkle. It\xe2\x80\x99s a long story.\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99ll pick you up in ten minutes. Gentlemen, adieu.\nLeonard: I thought we were going to play Halo tonight.\nHoward: What am I supposed to do, Leonard? There\xe2\x80\x99s a woman out there anxious to have sex with me. You understand, right?\nPenny: No. Not at all.\nHoward: Nevertheless, I must depart. By the way, did I tell you? Leslie pulled some strings and got me on the research trip to Geneva to check out the CERN Supercollider.\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99s not fair. You\xe2\x80\x99re not even a physicist.\nHoward: Okay, there are two ways of looking at this\xe2\x80\xa6\nLeonard: Get out.\nHoward: Bye.\nScene: Howard\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom.\nLeslie: You\xe2\x80\x99re improving.\nHoward: Thank you. It helps when I get to practice with a real woman.\nLeslie: Hey, listen. Saturday my sister\xe2\x80\x99s getting married. I.. I want you to come with me. It\xe2\x80\x99s black tie.\nHoward: Yeah, gee, I\xe2\x80\x99d really rather not.\nLeslie: Why not?\nHoward: When I go to weddings, it\xe2\x80\x99s to scam on chunky bridesmaids. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what I would do with a date.\nLeslie: Oh, all right. I understand.\nHoward: Thanks.\nLeslie: Hey, I\xe2\x80\x99m really sorry about that Geneva trip.\nHoward: What about it?\nLeslie: Oh, didn\xe2\x80\x99t you hear? I had to reduce the number of people going, and you didn\xe2\x80\x99t make the cut.\nHoward: When did that happen?\nLeslie: About 12 seconds ago.\nHoward: Well, hold on. Are you saying if I don\xe2\x80\x99t go to the wedding, I can\xe2\x80\x99t go to Geneva?\nLeslie: Actually, I\xe2\x80\x99m trying not to say it.\nHoward: Okay, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, but that makes me a little uncomfortable.\nLeslie: How so?\nHoward: Because it\xe2\x80\x99s like you\xe2\x80\x99re controlling me with new equipment and research trips.\nLeslie: Well, if I weren\xe2\x80\x99t controlling you with new equipment and research trips, then I\xe2\x80\x99d be uncomfortable.\nHoward: How so?\nLeslie: \xe2\x80\x98Cause then we\xe2\x80\x99d be in, like, a real relationship with feelings and all that crap.\nHoward: So, bottom line, I\xe2\x80\x99m just a bought-and-paid-for sex toy.\nLeslie: No. No, not at all. You\xe2\x80\x99re also arm candy. So? What do you think?\nHoward: Hey, Ma, you got to rent me a tux!\nHoward\xe2\x80\x99s Mother (voice): Right now? What kind of sex are you having up there?\nScene: The apartment\nLeonard: Why are you crouching there?\nSheldon: This is my spot. Where else am I supposed to crouch?\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Texas?\nPenny (arriving with cushion): Here you go. Fresh from the cleaners, good as new.\nLeonard: Really? Great. Sheldon, look. Good as new.\nSheldon: From that key maker, I highly doubt it.\nPenny: Come on, Sheldon. Just give it a try.\nSheldon: All right.\nPenny: There, nice and comfy cosy. Zero, zero, zero.\nSheldon: There\xe2\x80\x99s one more zero. You forgot the time parameter.\nPenny: Sit on the damn couch.\nSheldon: Nope.\nPenny: What do you mean, nope? What\xe2\x80\x99s wrong with it?\nLeonard: Nothing, it\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x99s wrong with him.\nPenny: It\xe2\x80\x99s exactly the same\xe2\x80\xa6\nLeonard: Penny, Penny, I think I know what to do. Sheldon, I have some bad news.\nSheldon: More?\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid so. You know the cashew chicken I get you Monday nights?\nSheldon: Yes. From Szechuan Palace.\nLeonard: Szechuan Palace closed two years ago.\nSheldon: What? Wh-Where did my cashew chicken come from?\nLeonard: Golden Dragon.\nSheldon: No. No, this isn\xe2\x80\x99t right. Our food always comes in Szechuan Palace containers.\nLeonard: Yeah, well, before they went out of business, I bought 4,000 containers. I keep them in the trunk of my car.\nSheldon: But. Oh, this changes everything.\nLeonard: I thought that might take his mind off the cushion.\nSheldon: What\xe2\x80\x99s real? What isn\xe2\x80\x99t? How can I know?\nPenny: You did make that up, right?\nLeonard: Oh, God, I wish I had.\nSheldon: Leonard?\nLeonard: Yeah, buddy?\nSheldon: I still don\xe2\x80\x99t like this cushion.\nScene: The paint ball range.\nLeonard: Okay, first of all, Penny, thank you for coming.\nPenny: Thanks for the shoes.\nLeonard: Penny is an amazing shot. I think we have a real chance to win this week.\nHoward: What\xe2\x80\x99s the plan?\nLeonard: Okay. Now, we all run out. Sheldon and I will cut to the left behind these trees. Raj, Howard and Leslie flank to the right behind the rocks. Then we\xe2\x80\x99ll all have a great view as Penny runs out and kills everyone else in sight.\nSheldon: Right, just one thing before we start.\nLeonard: What is it, Sheldon? (Sheldon shoots Penny)\nPenny: What the hell?\nSheldon: That was for my cushion.\nLeonard: Sheldon, Penny was our only hope.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, Leonard. But revenge is a dish best served cold.\nPenny: Screw that. (Shoots Sheldon)\nSheldon: She can\xe2\x80\x99t shoot me. She\xe2\x80\x99s dead.\nLeonard: He\xe2\x80\x99s right. You can\xe2\x80\x99t. (Shoots Sheldon)\nSheldon: Well, if we\xe2\x80\x99re going to descend into anarchy (Shoots Leonard)\nHoward: Okay, see you.\nLeonard: Where are you going?\nLeslie: Surrender, then Denny\xe2\x80\x99s.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
