b'Scene: The comic book store.\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s from Game of Thrones. What do you think?\nSheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. If we\xe2\x80\x99re going to start a fantasy sword collection, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve long thought we should, is this really the sword to start with?\nLeonard: What did you have in mind?\nSheldon: Well, off the top of my head, I\xe2\x80\x99d have to go with Excalibur. It gives you the right to rule England.\nLeonard: It would be a replica of a movie prop.\nSheldon: Fair enough. It\xe2\x80\x99d give you the right to rule a replica of England.\nLeonard: Well, they don\xe2\x80\x99t have an Excalibur here, so what do you want to do?\nSheldon: Mm. Tough decision. There\xe2\x80\x99s no weaponry from Lord of the Rings, forged in a Chinese sweatshop?\nLeonard: Just Bilbo Baggins\xe2\x80\x99 sword over there.\nSheldon: Two grown men with a hobbit\xe2\x80\x99s dagger; wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t we look silly? Okay, let\xe2\x80\x99s go for it.\nStuart: Oh, I see you guys have found my little treasure.\nLeonard: Yeah. It\xe2\x80\x99s okay, I guess.\nSheldon: Okay? It\xe2\x80\x99s magnificent.\nLeonard: Buh-buh-buh-buh! What do you want for it?\nStuart: Oh, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to put a price on something that\xe2\x80\x99s a copy of something that was on pay cable. But for my friends, let\xe2\x80\x99s say 250?\nLeonard: Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s pretty steep.\nStuart: Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s a limited edition. They only made 8,000 of these bad boys.\nSheldon: Only 8,000? We\xe2\x80\x99re wasting precious time. Buy it.\nLeonard: Hang on. Can you do any better?\nStuart: Are you kidding? I\xe2\x80\x99m already giving you the friends and family discount.\nSheldon: Oh, did you hear that? We\xe2\x80\x99re getting the friends and family discount. We are honoured and we will take it.\nLeonard: Slow down. Two hundred.\nSheldon: What are you doing? Two fifty is already the discounted price.\nLeonard: Will you shut up?\nStuart: Tell you what, I\xe2\x80\x99ll go two thirty-five.\nLeonard: Nope. Maybe another time.\nStuart: Okay, two twenty five, my final offer.\nSheldon: Take it, take it.\nLeonard: Two hundred.\nStuart: Man, you\xe2\x80\x99re killing me!\nSheldon: Killing you? I can\xe2\x80\x99t breathe.\nStuart: Two ten, and I\xe2\x80\x99m losing money.\nSheldon: Oh, now, we can\xe2\x80\x99t let him lose money, Leonard. I\xe2\x80\x99m so sorry.\nLeonard: Two ten and you throw in the Iron Man helmet.\nStuart: Are you crazy? That helmet\xe2\x80\x99s signed by Robert Downey Jr.\nLeonard: So?\nStuart: Okay, if you\xe2\x80\x99re going to question the importance of an actor\xe2\x80\x99s signature on a plastic helmet from a movie based on a comic book, then all of our lives have no meaning!\nLeonard: Okay, fine. Just the sword, two ten.\nStuart: Thank you. I can eat meat this week.\nLeonard: See that? I just saved us forty bucks.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99ve long said, what you lack in academic knowledge you make up for in street smarts.\nStuart: You want me to wrap it?\nLeonard: No, it\xe2\x80\x99s okay. I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna stab my friend in the chest.\nWil Wheaton (entering): Hey, Stuart.\nStuart: Ah, hey, Wil.\nSheldon: Hello, Wil Wheaton.\nWil: Hi, Sheldon. Nice sword.\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s part of my sword collection. Do you have a sword collection?\nWil: No.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m not surprised.\nStuart: Here\xe2\x80\x99s the Batman 612 with the Jim Lee alternate cover that you wanted.\nWil: Awesome. What do I owe you?\nStuart: Forty bucks.\nWil: Good deal.\nSheldon: Sucker. Didn\xe2\x80\x99t even ask for the friends and family discount.\nWil: Hey, I\xe2\x80\x99m having a party at my house on Friday, and I was hoping you would stop by.\nStuart: Will there be girls there?\nWil: Yeah, of course.\nStuart: \xe2\x80\x98Cause there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t last time.\nWil: There will be girls. You guys are invited if you want to come by.\nLeonard: Thank you.\nWil: All right, great. Later.\nSheldon: I see what you\xe2\x80\x99re doing. You accept an invitation to a party at the home of my sworn enemy, he tells everyone we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be there, and when we don\xe2\x80\x99t show, he looks the fool. Fiendishly clever.\nLeonard: I was actually thinking about going.\nSheldon: And then declaring the party a fiasco and storming out, leaving him humiliated in front of his guests. Love it.\nLeonard: No, I was gonna grab Raj and Howard and have a good time.\nStuart: Oh, great, more guys. It\xe2\x80\x99s gonna be another Wil Wheaton sausage-fest.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: Sheldon, can you grab me a water?\nSheldon: Possibly.\nLeonard: Can you or can\xe2\x80\x99t you?\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s not that simple, Leonard.\nLeonard: It never is, is it?\nSheldon: At this moment, our relationship exists in two mutually contradictory states. Until you either do not go or go to Wil Wheaton\xe2\x80\x99s party, you are simultaneously my friend and not my friend. I\xe2\x80\x99m characterizing this phenomenon as Schrodinger\xe2\x80\x99s Friendship.\nLeonard: Got it. Can I have my water?\nSheldon: Of course. Now get it yourself, you traitor.\nPenny: Wait, what is going on?\nSheldon: In case you have forgotten, Schrodinger\xe2\x80\x99s cat is a thought experiment\xe2\x80\xa6\nPenny: No, no, no, no, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t forget. Um, there\xe2\x80\x99s this cat in a box and until you open it, it\xe2\x80\x99s either dead or alive or both. Although, back in Nebraska, our cat got stuck in my brother\xe2\x80\x99s camp trunk, and we did not need to open it to know there was all kinds of dead cat in there.\nAmy: Homespun stories, knowledge of physics and a bosom that defies it. You\xe2\x80\x99re the whole package, aren\xe2\x80\x99t you?\nHoward (arriving): Sorry I\xe2\x80\x99m late. Uh, I got great news. NASA picked my team\xe2\x80\x99s design for the deep field space telescope that\xe2\x80\x99s going on the International Space Station this spring.\nAll: Wow.\nBernadette: Howie, that\xe2\x80\x99s wonderful! Congratulations!\nHoward: It gets better. Someone has to go up with the telescope as a payload specialist, and guess who that someone is.\nSheldon: Mohammed Lee.\nHoward: Who\xe2\x80\x99s Mohammed Lee?\nSheldon: Mohammed is the most common first name in the world, Lee, the most common surname. As I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer, I thought that gave me a mathematical edge.\nHoward: It\xe2\x80\x99s me, Sheldon. It\xe2\x80\x99s me. I\xe2\x80\x99m going up in space! Technically, I\xe2\x80\x99m an astronaut.\nAll: Wow, that\xe2\x80\x99s amazing!\nBernadette: Hang on a second. NASA doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have a shuttle any more. How are you going to get up there?\nHoward: Oh, well, it\xe2\x80\x99s really cool. You fly to Moscow, they take you out to Kazakhstan, and then you get into a Russian Soyuz rocket which shoots you into a low earth orbit. Or just sits there on the launch pad because the Kazakhi mafia sold the rocket fuel on the black market.\nBernadette: Are those Russian rockets safe?\nHoward: Well, I mean, safe as it can be when it was built by the good folks who brought you Chernobyl.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99d like to propose a toast. The dream to go up into space is one we all share, and Howard\xe2\x80\x99s making that a reality. We\xe2\x80\x99re all very proud of you.\nAll: Cheers.\nSheldon: That was a lovely toast. Kudos.\nLeonard: Thank you.\nSheldon: Simultaneously, a festival of cloying clich\xc3\xa9s. You sicken me.\nScene: Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s car.\nHoward: You\xe2\x80\x99re really quiet. Is everything okay?\nBernadette: Fine. Just a little tired.\nHoward: I hope not too tired, because I\xe2\x80\x99m feeling particularly masculine right now. All systems go, if you catch my drift.\nBernadette: I always catch your drift.\nHoward: All right, well, something\xe2\x80\x99s obviously bugging you. What is it?\nBernadette: I just can\xe2\x80\x99t believe you signed up for the space program without even talking to me.\nHoward: Oh, I get it. You\xe2\x80\x99re worried about me. That is so sweet. You know, there\xe2\x80\x99s a saying we have at NASA. What makes the right stuff so right is that it always comes home.\nBernadette: Just stop talking, Howard.\nHoward: This isn\xe2\x80\x99t the reaction I expected when I told you I was gonna be an astronaut.\nBernadette: What did you think was going to happen?\nHoward: Honestly? Sex.\nBernadette: Howard.\nHoward: Do you realize what a big deal this is? What an honour it is to be chosen to go into space?\nBernadette: Yeah, I get it. I just wish you included me in the decision. We\xe2\x80\x99re supposed to be partners. We\xe2\x80\x99re supposed to be a team.\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. You\xe2\x80\x99re right. Okay, let\xe2\x80\x99s try this again. Bernadette, an opportunity has come up that impacts both of us, and I\xe2\x80\x99d like to discuss it.\nBernadette: Okay.\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99ve been offered a chance to go up to the International Space Station for three weeks. What are your thoughts on that?\nBernadette: Well, first of all, thank you for including me in the decision-making process.\nHoward: Hey, we\xe2\x80\x99re a team. So, what do you think?\nBernadette: No.\nHoward: No?\nBernadette: No.\nHoward: Well why not?\nBernadette: Howard, my father was a police officer. We never knew from one night to the next if he was going to come home alive. It was horrible. And I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to live that way with you.\nHoward: Hey, my father abandoned me and my mother when I was 11. We never saw him again.\nBernadette: Oh, boo-hoo, you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to space!\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: Pretty cool about Howard, huh?\nSheldon: Don\xe2\x80\x99t talk to me as if nothing\xe2\x80\x99s happened between us. And yes, it sure is, buddy.\nLeonard: For God\xe2\x80\x99s sake, will you stop with the Schrodinger stuff.\nSheldon: Would you prefer a simpler application of Heisenberg\xe2\x80\x99s uncertainty principle, in which I could either know where you are or whether I like you, but not both?\nLeonard: You never stop talking, do you?\nAmy: I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand. What differences does it make if Leonard goes to Wil Wheaton\xe2\x80\x99s party?\nPenny: Wil Wheaton is Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s mortal enemy.\nAmy: Mortal enemy?\nPenny: Mm-hmm.\nAmy: Sheldon, I know you\xe2\x80\x99re a bit of a left-handed monkey wrench, but, you really have a mortal enemy?\nSheldon: In fact, I have 61 of them. Would you like to see the list?\nPenny: Oh, say no, say no, say no, say no.\nSheldon: You just got off the list. Would you like back on it? This\xe2\x80\x99ll just take a moment. It\xe2\x80\x99s on a five and a quarter inch floppy.\nAmy: A floppy disk?\nSheldon: Well, I started the list when I was nine.\nAmy: How did Wil Wheaton get on the list?\nAll: Oh! Oh, God!\nSheldon: As a child, I loved Wesley Crusher, Wil Wheaton\xe2\x80\x99s character on Star Trek. So, I drove for hours by bus to a Star Trek convention at which Wil Wheaton was scheduled to appear, so that I could get my Wesley Crusher action figure signed. But he never showed, because apparently, it was cooler for him to be the lower-left corner on Hollywood Squares. Oh, damn! The floppy failed. Well, whoever was in charge of quality control at the Verbatim Corporation in 1989, congratulations, you just made the list.\nScene: Howard\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom.\nBernadette: Howard?\nHoward: Change your mind about sex? I\xe2\x80\x99m still mad, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll do it.\nBernadette: No, I\xe2\x80\x99ve just been thinking. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter if I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid for your safety. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be the person who stands between you and your dreams.\nHoward: Really?\nBernadette: Really. If going into space means that much to you, I will never say another word about it.\nHoward: Thank you.\nBernadette: I love you.\nHoward: I love you, too. So, sex now?\nBernadette: Okay. I just forgot to brush my teeth. I\xe2\x80\x99ll be right back. (Exits)\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Over my dead body my son goes into outer space!\nBernadette: I\xe2\x80\x99m ready.\nScene: The cafeteria.\nLeonard: Wait, let me see if I got this right. You actually asked Bernadette to leave your house in the middle of the night?\nHoward: What choice did I have? She went behind my back and turned my own mother against me.\nRaj: Wow. You\xe2\x80\x99re not only our first astronaut. You\xe2\x80\x99re also the first one of us to kick a girl out of bed. You\xe2\x80\x99re like a rock star.\nHoward: Little bit.\nLeonard: I hate to say it, but she did kind of betray you.\nSheldon: Interesting. You see betrayal in others, but not yourself.\nLeonard: Going to Wheaton\xe2\x80\x99s party is not betraying you.\nSheldon: Oh, of course you would have to believe that. Evil always thinks it\xe2\x80\x99s doing right. Excuse me, Stormtrooper. These are the droids you\xe2\x80\x99re looking for.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m going to a party. I\xe2\x80\x99m not turning R2-D2 and C-3PO over to the empire!\nSheldon: Not yet.\nRaj: So, what\xe2\x80\x99s gonna happen next? Are you and Bernadette going to break up?\nHoward: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. If we\xe2\x80\x99re going to get back together, she\xe2\x80\x99s going to have to apologize and accept that I\xe2\x80\x99m a grown man who can make his own decisions.\nRaj: Then she\xe2\x80\x99s going to have to convince your mother to let you go into space.\nHoward: Obviously.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nBernadette: I had no choice. I had to tell his mother. He can\xe2\x80\x99t go to space. He\xe2\x80\x99s like a baby bird. Do you know he once got an asthma attack from reading an old library book?\nAmy: You\xe2\x80\x99re kidding.\nPenny: No, I was there that day. Sheldon threw his back out handing him that book.\nBernadette: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what I\xe2\x80\x99m going to do. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to break up over this.\nPenny: Okay, why don\xe2\x80\x99t you just tell him you made a mistake?\nBernadette: Do you guys think it was a mistake? Am I the bad guy in this?\nAmy: It\xe2\x80\x99s not for us to judge. We\xe2\x80\x99re just here to provide comfort and support while you come to grips with what a despicable thing you\xe2\x80\x99ve done.\nBernadette: Oh, God, you\xe2\x80\x99re right. I took our love and threw it under his bus-sized mother. I need to apologize.\nPenny: Well, that, that\xe2\x80\x99s good. I\xe2\x80\x99m glad you came to that. But before you do, let me just ask you a big picture question.\nBernadette: What?\nPenny: Are you a hundred percent positive you love and want to marry Howard Wolowitz?\nBernadette: I do, with all my heart.\nPenny: Got it. Just had to check.\nAmy: He\xe2\x80\x99s great.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: All right, Sheldon, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to Wil\xe2\x80\x99s. This is your last chance.\nSheldon: No, Leonard, this is your last chance. One day, a historian is going to come to you and say, is it true you were friends with Dr. Sheldon Cooper? And you\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to choke back a hot sob of regret and humiliation as you mumble, I was, but I chose to go to a party thrown by the one kid from Stand By Me that no one remembers.\nLeonard: You want to drive?\nRaj: Sure.\nLeonard: Hey, Sheldon?\nSheldon: Oh, good. You picked me, you picked me.\nLeonard: No, I just got a text from Stuart. Brent Spiner is at the party.\nSheldon: Brent Spiner?\nLeonard: Yes.\nSheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t care.\nLeonard: Really? Brent Spiner, Mr. Data himself. You love him.\nSheldon: I did, but I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve kind of outgrown Star Trek. You know, stock characters, ludicrous plots, beam me up. What a load of hooey.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m going. Live long and prosper, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Yeah, even that. You look like a dork.\nScene: Howard\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Howard, Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s here!\nHoward: Tell her I\xe2\x80\x99m not home!\nMrs Wolowitz (off): What kind of a schmuck play is that? She can hear you shouting!\nBernadette: Can we talk?\nHoward: You can. I have nothing to say.\nBernadette: All right. I just wanted to tell you I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry I said something to your mother.\nHoward: I was gonna tell her eventually, but you went behind my back.\nBernadette: I know. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. I got scared.\nHoward: If you\xe2\x80\x99re gonna love me, you\xe2\x80\x99re gonna have to love the whole package, the tenderhearted poet and the crazy daredevil.\nBernadette: I know.\nHoward: Well, don\xe2\x80\x99t say it if you\xe2\x80\x99re not gonna mean it, \xe2\x80\x99cause I\xe2\x80\x99m not just gonna stop with the space station. Yeah, I want to go to the Moon, I want to go to Mars. I want to take a one-man sub to the lowest depths of the ocean.\nBernadette: Really? You got seasick on Pirates of the Caribbean.\nHoward: Well, those big kids were rocking it.\nBernadette: I just did what I did because I love you so much, and the thought of losing you is more than I can handle.\nHoward: Really?\nBernadette: You\xe2\x80\x99re my soul mate. This is where you kiss me.\nHoward: Right, right.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Make up all you want! Your tuchus is not leaving this planet!\nScene: Wil Wheaton\xe2\x80\x99s party.\nRaj: Hey, you know that beautiful actress who plays the Borg Queen in First Contact?\nLeonard: Yeah.\nRaj: Well, I just met her gynaecologist!\nLeonard: What are you doing here?\nSheldon: Fighting for our friendship. As peculiar and annoying as you can be, you\xe2\x80\x99re still my little buddy. I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to let that end here tonight. Now put down that drink, let\xe2\x80\x99s meet Brent Spiner and go home.\nWil: Hey, Sheldon, I\xe2\x80\x99m so glad you made it. I found something I think you might like.\nSheldon: What I\xe2\x80\x99d like is for him to have a more depressing home. This is quite lovely.\nWil: This is for you.\nSheldon: An original mint-in-package Wesley Crusher action figure.\nWil: I remembered your story about the time you went to a convention when you were a kid to get one signed, and I didn\xe2\x80\x99t show up.\nWil: Look at what I wrote.\nSheldon: To Sheldon, sorry this took so long. Your friend, Wil Wheaton.\nWil: It\xe2\x80\x99s my last one. I want you to have it.\nSheldon: Look, everyone. Wil Wheaton is my friend!\nBrent Spiner: Oh, wow. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen one of these in years. (Rips open action figure packaging) Remember how we used to make these things look like they were masturbating?\nSheldon: Brent Spiner, what have you done? That was an original mint-in-package Wesley Crusher action figure signed by my close personal friend, Wil Wheaton.\nBrent: Sorry, Slim. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got some Mr. Data dolls in the trunk of my car. You want me to sign one for you?\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99ve already signed something, Brent Spiner. Your name on my list. From this moment on, you are my mortal enemy.\nWil: Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t take up a whole lot of your time.\nSheldon: Come on, buddy. Let\xe2\x80\x99s not waste another second on this loser. Love your house.\nLeonard: Can we get autographed dolls?\nBrent: Sure. Twenty bucks.\nLeonard: Ten.\nBrent: Eighteen.\nLeonard: Twelve.\nBrent: Sixteen.\nLeonard: Two for thirty. And you come to my birthday party.\nBrent: Done.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
