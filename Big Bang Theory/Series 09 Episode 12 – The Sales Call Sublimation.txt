b'Scene: The apartment.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m glad to see you made it safely. How\xe2\x80\x99s your hotel?\nAmy (on Skype): It\xe2\x80\x99s not the best Best Western I\xe2\x80\x99ve been to, but I\xe2\x80\x99d say it\xe2\x80\x99s the third best Best Western I\xe2\x80\x99ve been to.\nSheldon: I know how you feel. The Best Buy by my house is only the third best Best Buy. They have the best buys, but having the best buys isn\xe2\x80\x99t the only thing that makes a Best Buy the best Best Buy.\nAmy: What makes a best Best Buy the best Best Buy?\nSheldon: Mm, that\xe2\x80\x99s a great question. I like when they\xe2\x80\x99re next to a Chipotle.\nAmy: Okay, well, I should unpack.\nSheldon: All right. Enjoy the neurobiology conference.\nAmy: I will. I wish you were here.\nSheldon: At a neurobiology conference? What a mean thing to say.\nAmy: Okay, I\xe2\x80\x99m glad you\xe2\x80\x99re not here?\nSheldon: Aw, you always know just what to say after I tell you what to say.\nAmy: Good-bye, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Bye. Oh, good news, gentlemen. Amy\xe2\x80\x99s at a conference this weekend, which means I\xe2\x80\x99m available to be entertained, hmm. As today\xe2\x80\x99s youth might put it, who wants to get their Sheld-on?\nHoward: Bernie and I are getting the house ready for the remodel. We could always use an extra pair of hands.\nSheldon: That sounds awful. Raj?\nRaj: Uh, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got time booked in the telescope room all weekend scanning for rogue planets. You\xe2\x80\x99re more than welcome to join me.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s the one to beat. Leonard?\nLeonard: Oh, if anything, I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to get my Sheld-off.\nSheldon: Well, then it looks like we have a winner. Congratulations.\nRaj: Well, I should warn you, it\xe2\x80\x99s just looking at data for hours and hours on a computer screen.\nSheldon: Uh, stop selling it, kid. You won.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The apartment.\nPenny: Hey.\nLeonard: Hey.\nRaj: Hello.\nHoward: Hi.\nLeonard: How was your day?\nPenny: Oh, not good. Still couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get in to see Dr. Gallo.\nSheldon: A doctor? Well, I hope you\xe2\x80\x99re not contagious. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a weekend in the telescope room I\xe2\x80\x99ve been excited about for almost three minutes.\nPenny: I\xe2\x80\x99m not sick. It\xe2\x80\x99s for work. There\xe2\x80\x99s this doctor who refuses to see any sales reps. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been trying to get in for months.\nLeonard: Well, did you try wearing the shirt I said was inappropriate for work?\nPenny: Well, the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s a woman, but yes, because you never know.\nHoward: What kind of doctor is she?\nPenny: Um, a psychiatrist. Why?\nHoward: Well, what if you make an appointment as a patient? Then you\xe2\x80\x99ll get to talk to her.\nPenny: Yeah, they already know I\xe2\x80\x99m a pharmaceutical sales rep.\nRaj: Oh. What if Leonard made an appointment and tried to lay some groundwork for you?\nPenny: That\xe2\x80\x99s interesting.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m not gonna make a fake appointment with a psychiatrist. What would I say is wrong with me?\nRaj: Low self-esteem.\nHoward: Social anxiety.\nSheldon: Sexual insecurity.\nLeonard: None of that is true.\nPenny: Uh, denial. See, sweetie, the list goes on and on.\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99s just crazy. How would my going in there even help you?\nPenny: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. You could talk to her, and maybe if it comes up, you could ask if she\xe2\x80\x99s heard about the drug.\nLeonard: What if I get caught?\nHoward: Fear of failure.\nRaj: Lack of confidence.\nSheldon: Kind of a wuss.\nLeonard: Fine, I\xe2\x80\x99ll do it. But not because of them, because I love you.\nPenny: Thank you.\nRaj: Pushover.\nHoward: Spineless.\nSheldon: Still hasn\xe2\x80\x99t bought milk even though I told him two days ago.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom.\nHoward: That was incredible.\nBernadette: It was. I just wish Stuart wasn\xe2\x80\x99t around so we didn\xe2\x80\x99t have to be so quiet.\nHoward: I know. It\xe2\x80\x99s not like he returns the favour when he watches his Japanese porn cartoons.\nStuart (knocking): You guys got a minute, or are you still cuddling?\nHoward: What is it, Stuart?\nStuart: Can I come in?\nHoward: Hang on. Should I send him away?\nBernadette: No, it\xe2\x80\x99s okay.\nStuart: Thanks, Bernie.\nHoward: What\xe2\x80\x99s up?\nStuart: Uh, well, I know the remodel is coming up, so I thought I\xe2\x80\x99d make it easy on you guys and find my own place.\nHoward: Wow. I thought I was done getting lucky tonight.\nBernadette: So, when are you thinking of moving?\nStuart: Uh, actually, I already found an apartment, so in a couple of days.\nBernadette: Oh. Okay. Sorry to see you go?\nStuart: Okay, well, thank you guys for everything. I, I really appreciate it.\nBernadette: : You\xe2\x80\x99re very welcome.\nStuart: Hmm.\nHoward: What?\nStuart: Hmm, I just have never been in this room while you\xe2\x80\x99re awake.\nScene: The telescope room.\nSheldon: What are you doing?\nRaj: Uh, making sure the telescope\xe2\x80\x99s camera is white-field balanced.\nSheldon: Hmm. What are you doing now?\nRaj: Still making sure the telescope\xe2\x80\x99s camera is white-field balanced.\nSheldon: Oh, I see. How about now?\nRaj: Now I\xe2\x80\x99m making sure the telescope\xe2\x80\x99s camera is white-field balanced and wishing you had a colouring book.\nSheldon: Well, I can be helpful. Give me something to do. You know, my father took me to work once, and in ten minutes I figured out who\xe2\x80\x99d been stealing from the cash register. It was my father. Yeah, Dad lost his job, but Mr. Hinckley gave me a Fudgsicle.\nRaj: Fine, you want something to do? There\xe2\x80\x99s about six months of data on this hard drive. Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you go through it and see if you can spot any patterns or anomalies.\nSheldon: Yep, I\xe2\x80\x99m on it. Hey, look at that, an Indian guy outsourcing a computer job to a white fella.\nRaj: Yeah, okay, whatever it takes to keep you busy for a few hours.\nSheldon: Found one.\nRaj: No, you didn\xe2\x80\x99t. There are millions of data points there.\nSheldon: But, look, an optical transient.\nRaj: Yeah, maybe that is something. How did you find that?\nSheldon: It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t difficult. You know how when you see prime numbers, they appear red, but when they\xe2\x80\x99re twin primes, they\xe2\x80\x99re pink and smell like gasoline?\nRaj: No.\nSheldon: Oh. I guess I\xe2\x80\x99m a special boy. You know, sometimes when a boy is special, he gets a Fudgsicle. Which, by the way, tastes like the speed of light.\nScene: Dr Gallo\xe2\x80\x99s office.\nLeonard: Thank you for seeing me on such short notice.\nDr Gallo: Ah, it\xe2\x80\x99s my pleasure. I\xe2\x80\x99m curious, are you related to Dr. Beverly Hofstadter?\nLeonard: Uh, she\xe2\x80\x99s my mother. You know her?\nDr Gallo: No, not personally, but I have read all of her books.\nLeonard: Well, then you know her better than I do.\nDr Gallo: Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not so sure about that. But I can tell you I do not agree with her theories on child rearing at all.\nLeonard: Really? Any chance you find them cold, cruel and unsuitable for innocent little boys who just want to be happy?\nDr Gallo: Well, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to say it.\nLeonard: No, no, say it. Sing it. Rent a plane, write it in the sky.\nDr Gallo: Sounds like you\xe2\x80\x99re holding on to quite a bit of anger towards her.\nLeonard: Oh, no, I, I\xe2\x80\x99ve worked through a lot of that stuff, I\xe2\x80\x99m better now.\nDr Gallo: Mm. Good for you.\nLeonard: Do you know she never let me celebrate my birthday because being born was her achievement, not mine?\nDr Gallo: That\xe2\x80\x99s heartbreaking.\nLeonard: Right? To this day, I send her a card every year with a little money in it.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s house.\nHoward: You know, once we get the house back to ourselves, we can be romantic in any room we want.\nBernadette: Great. I can finally show you where the laundry room is.\nStuart: Boy, who would\xe2\x80\x99ve thought when you asked me to move in and help take care of your mom, I\xe2\x80\x99d still be here two years later?\nHoward: No one.\nBernadette: Nobody thought that.\nStuart: Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s it.\nBernadette: I guess so.\nStuart: This is weird.\nHoward: Yeah. A grown man moving into his own apartment. Crazy times. See ya.\nBernadette: Ignore him. He\xe2\x80\x99s just using humour to express how happy he is.\nStuart: It\xe2\x80\x99s okay. I know he loves me.\nBernadette: Sure he does. Well, let us know when you\xe2\x80\x99re all settled in.\nStuart: I will. And I really can\xe2\x80\x99t thank you guys enough.\nBernadette: Our pleasure.\nStuart: Bye.\nBernadette: Goodbye.\nHoward: He\xe2\x80\x99s gone. Let\xe2\x80\x99s start in the garage.\nScene: The telescope room.\nRaj: Okay, so once we receive the next image and compare it to the ones we\xe2\x80\x99ve already collected, we\xe2\x80\x99ll know what it is that we found.\nSheldon: Ooh, perhaps it\xe2\x80\x99s a Heliosheath scintillation.\nRaj: It could be a trans-Neptunian object.\nSheldon: Maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s a new planet.\nRaj: Unlikely, but it could be a dwarf planet.\nSheldon: Well, as long as it has a healthy gravity and all its moons, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be happy.\nRaj: Okay, the final image is coming in. And the object we discovered is\xe2\x80\xa6\nSheldon: Come on, Daddy needs a livable planet he can rule with an iron fist.\nRaj: A medium-sized asteroid.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s it? How common. That\xe2\x80\x99s the chicken fingers on the menu of space.\nRaj: I kind of like chicken fingers.\nSheldon: Yeah, me, too. I was stuck for a metaphor.\nRaj: Come on, a medium-sized asteroid is still an interesting discovery.\nSheldon: I suppose it could end up on a collision course with Earth and destroy life as we know it.\nRaj: You dream different than me.\nSheldon: It is kind of cute.\nRaj: Yeah, it is. And you know we get to name it.\nSheldon: We better choose a name no one can make fun of. Sir Frederick William Herschel didn\xe2\x80\x99t do Uranus any favours.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: Hi.\nPenny: Hey, how\xe2\x80\x99d it go?\nLeonard: Oh, great. Dr. Gallo is terrific. You know, I, I\xe2\x80\x99ve always been insecure that no one cares about what I have to say, but she made me see\xe2\x80\xa6\nPenny: Yeah, no one cares. Did you help me out or not?\nLeonard: Okay, now, what I\xe2\x80\x99m hearing is that you feel that I sometimes take too long to express myself, and you wish I\xe2\x80\x99d be more succinct.\nPenny: You\xe2\x80\x99re only hearing that because I cannot roll my eyes any louder.\nLeonard: All right, well, after we talked about my issues with my mother, nothing too deep, just how she ruined my life, I told her about you and your drug. She said she\xe2\x80\x99d be happy to meet you.\nPenny: Really? Oh, you\xe2\x80\x99re the best husband ever.\nLeonard: So you\xe2\x80\x99ll go to the Doctor Who convention with me next week?\nPenny: I guess.\nLeonard: Oh, I actually did hear your eyes roll that time.\nScene: Stuarts former bedroom in Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s house.\nBernadette: Boy, when was the last time Stuart cleaned this place?\nHoward: No kidding. Oh, okay, I\xe2\x80\x99m about to suck something up. What do you think this object sounds like?\nBernadette: Howie, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to play Lego, Toenail or Pill anymore. So, what do you think we should do with this room?\nHoward: Well, I was thinking a home theatre or a gaming room, you know, like a man cave.\nBernadette: Why can\xe2\x80\x99t it be a woman cave?\nHoward: As long as it has a home theatre, a video game system and you\xe2\x80\x99re not allowed in it, you can call it whatever you want.\nBernadette: I\xe2\x80\x99m being serious.\nHoward: Well, what do you think we should do?\nBernadette: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, maybe a home office or, oh look. The teddy bear Stuart won the night we took him to the fair.\nHoward: Oh. He was so excited.\nBernadette: Yeah. You know, no matter how hard they tried, they could not guess his age.\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99ll give it to him next time I see him.\nBernadette: Have you heard from him since he left?\nHoward: No. You\xe2\x80\x99d think he would\xe2\x80\x99ve called once he got settled in.\nBernadette: Hmm. Maybe he\xe2\x80\x99s busy.\nHoward: Too busy to call? He wasn\xe2\x80\x99t too busy to binge-watch Hot in Cleveland with my Hulu password. What is happening? Are we missing him?\nBernadette: No, that\xe2\x80\x99s not what this feeling is. Is it?\nHoward: Of course not. He drove us crazy. Like when you were gonna make that pie and Stuart ate all the blueberries.\nBernadette: And he tried to deny it, but his teeth were all purple.\nHoward: That was pretty cute.\nBernadette: Yeah. Ew, we are missing him!\nScene: The apartment.\nRaj: So I was thinking, maybe we can come up with a name for the asteroid by combining our names.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s a great idea. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got it. We\xe2\x80\x99ll call it Cooper.\nRaj: How is that both our names?\nSheldon: Koo from Koothrappali and per from Cooper.\nRaj: Yeah, s-so it\xe2\x80\x99s, like, Kooper with a K?\nSheldon: Nah, you\xe2\x80\x99re right, that\xe2\x80\x99s dumb.\nLeonard: Hey.\nSheldon: Oh, Leonard, great news. We discovered a medium-sized asteroid together.\nLeonard: Wow, that\xe2\x80\x99s amazing. I\xe2\x80\x99m in a pretty great mood today myself.\nSheldon: Okay. Guess we\xe2\x80\x99re gonna talk about you now.\nLeonard: Well, we are, because Dr. Gallo made me realize that I\xe2\x80\x99m a worthwhile person and that my feelings matter.\nRaj: I learned that for free from a cat poster, but good for you.\nSheldon: Okay, back to me. I discovered an asteroid, and now I get to name it.\nRaj: Wait, what happened to us?\nSheldon: Now, this isn\xe2\x80\x99t about us, this is about what\xe2\x80\x99s best for the asteroid.\nLeonard: Well, what are you thinking of naming it?\nSheldon: I haven\xe2\x80\x99t settled on anything yet.\nRaj: We haven\xe2\x80\x99t settled on anything yet.\nSheldon: All right, way to go, Cat Poster. You hang in there.\nLeonard: You know what\xe2\x80\x99d be nice? Name it after your girlfriends. Show them how much you care.\nRaj: That is a great idea.\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s perfect. It appears romantic, but it\xe2\x80\x99s really just a rock in space that gets me out of Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s Day forever.\nRaj: So, uh, what were you thinking? Combine their names?\nSheldon: I like it. Yeah, we\xe2\x80\x99ll take the A-M from Amy and, uh, the Y from Emily.\nRaj: That\xe2\x80\x99s just Amy.\nSheldon: Exactly. See how well we work together?\nScene Dr Gallo\xe2\x80\x99s office.\nPenny: And in double-blind studies, Placinex proved extremely effective in treating all kinds of anxiety. Actually, funny story, the boys in the lab were worried about getting FDA approval for Placinex. They started taking it, stopped worrying.\nDr Gallo: Got it.\nPenny: Uh, do you have any questions?\nDr Gallo: Just one.\nPenny: Mm-hmm?\nDr Gallo: When you made your husband pretend to be a patient so you could get access to me, what were you thinking there?\nPenny: I just meant a question about the drug.\nDr Gallo: Yeah, I know what you meant. Let\xe2\x80\x99s put that aside for a minute and talk about why you married Leonard.\nPenny: I don\xe2\x80\x99t wanna.\nDr Gallo: Here is a man raised by an overbearing woman who completely dominated every aspect of his formative years. Do you think he\xe2\x80\x99s perpetuating that relationship by seeking out a partner like you?\nPenny: You know, I used to wear tank tops a lot. That was a big selling point.\nScene: The apartment.\nAmy (on Skype): Hi, Sheldon. What\xe2\x80\x99s up?\nSheldon: Good news. You\xe2\x80\x99re an asteroid.\nAmy: Uh, please tell me what to say next.\nSheldon: Perhaps I should explain. While working with Koothrappali, we discovered an asteroid, and I named it after you.\nAmy: Oh. Sheldon, thank you. That\xe2\x80\x99s so romantic. But what about Rajesh? He was okay with you choosing the name?\nSheldon: Well, it took a little negotiating, but I wore him down. Uh, we get the asteroid, and if you and I have children, they all have to be named Rajesh.\nAmy: All of them?\nSheldon: Even the girls.\nAmy: Okay, I think I know what to say now.\nScene: Dr Gallo\xe2\x80\x99s office.\nPenny: How can I not sound like his mother when our entire bedroom is filled with Star Wars toys? I mean, have you ever had sex with a stuffed Wookiee watching you?\nDr Gallo: I went to college in the \xe2\x80\x9970s. It was a hairier time. I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna say yes.\nPenny: You know, if anything, he\xe2\x80\x99s turning me into his mother. Before I did pharmaceutical sales, I was an actress. You know, I was pretty good. You know, girl-next-door type, but hot. Doable.\nDr Gallo: Hmm.\nPenny: And not only am I Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s mother, but we have this man-child living with us named Sheldon.\nDr Gallo: Oh, Leonard talked a lot about him. I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure if he was real.\nPenny: Yeah, he\xe2\x80\x99s as real as the fine I get when I use too much toilet paper.\nDr Gallo: Wow, you really do have a lot on your plate.\nPenny: I do. You know, Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s right. Talking to you is really helping.\nDr Gallo: Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m glad. You know, you might also benefit from a prescription for anxiety.\nPenny: Okay, if you think it\xe2\x80\x99ll help. Oh, just don\xe2\x80\x99t make it Placinex. I do not need sudden fits of homicidal rage.\nScene: The apartment.\nAmy (on Skype): I miss you.\nSheldon: I miss you as well.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s house.\nHoward: I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe I miss Stuart.\nScene: Dr Gallo\xe2\x80\x99s office.\nPenny: I guess I just miss when life was simpler.\nScene: A street. Leonard is skipping ropes with some young girls.\nGirls: Go, Leonard! Go, Leonard! Go, Leonard! Go, Leonard!\nLeonard: Remember, girls, you decide what makes you happy, not your emotionally withholding mothers.\nGirls: Go, Leonard! Go, Leonard! Go, Leonard! Go, Leonard! Go, Leonard!\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom. Howard and Bernadette are asleep.\nStuart: I really miss this.\n  Advertisements\nLoading...'
