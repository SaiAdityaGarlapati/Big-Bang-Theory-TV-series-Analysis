b'Scene: The apartment.\nAmy (on Skype): I didn\xe2\x80\x99t understand your e-mail.\nSheldon: Uh, can you repeat that? You\xe2\x80\x99re breaking up.\nAmy: I didn\xe2\x80\x99t understand your e-mail.\nSheldon: Ah. Yeah, I had to get a little creative because the S, R and M keys on my laptop stopped working.\nAmy: Deaw Aby, could you pleathe dwive be to the twain thtow thubtibe tobowow?\nSheldon: So, is that a yes?\nAmy: Sheldon, why don\xe2\x80\x99t you get a new computer? You know that one\xe2\x80\x99s out-of-date.\nSheldon: Oh, but I like this computer.\nAmy: The video is failing, and the sound is cutting out.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t get that.\nAmy: The video is failing, and the sound is cutting out.\nSheldon: The sound is cutting out. I can\xe2\x80\x99t read that. The video is failing.\nAmy: Get a new computer.\nSheldon: What?\nAmy: Get a new computer.\nSheldon: What? (Answering phone) Hello?\nAmy (on phone) Get a new computer.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: Howard\xe2\x80\x99s workshop.\nLeonard: This is cool. When was the last time you and I built something together?\nHoward: Scientifically? A little over a year ago. LEGOs? Last week in my room.\nLeonard: If there was a Nobel Prize for Millennium Falcons that fall apart when you pick them up, we\xe2\x80\x99d be set.\nPenny: Hey, guys.\nLeonard: Hey. What are you doing here?\nBernadette: We heard there were some sexy scientists working hard all weekend.\nPenny: Yup, so we brought you some lunch and we are gonna go look for \xe2\x80\x99em.\nLeonard: Soup, sandwiches and emasculation, just like my mom used to make.\nPenny: So, how\xe2\x80\x99s it goin\xe2\x80\x99?\nLeonard: Good. Slow.\nHoward: There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of tedious setup, but once we get through that it should go quicker.\nPenny: Is there anything we can do to help?\nLeonard: You know what, this part isn\xe2\x80\x99t that technical. You actually could.\nPenny: Wow, really? Called my bluff. All righty then.\nBernadette: Can we really help?\nHoward: While we finish soldering these boards, it\xe2\x80\x99d be great if you guys could wrap these pipe fittings with Teflon tape.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99ll show you how to do one.\nPenny: Hey, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it be funny if after all your years of hard work, I\xe2\x80\x99m the one who makes a scientific breakthrough? He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x99s funny.\nScene: The apartment.\nAmy: I got here as quickly as I could.\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re too late.\nAmy: Sheldon, this is silly.\nSheldon: You got emotional when that lab monkey died.\nAmy: That lab monkey told me he loved me in sign language.\nSheldon: Great. Now I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna have that song in my head all day.\nAmy: Look, I\xe2\x80\x99m, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry for your loss, but I think I have something that might make you feel better. I got you a new computer.\nSheldon: How could you do that?\nAmy: Do what?\nSheldon: Choosing a new laptop Is an incredibly personal ritual. You have taken away weeks of agonizing thought, tedious research, sleepless nights filled with indecision. I, haven\xe2\x80\x99t I lost enough today?\nAmy: Well, the guy at the store said this one is great.\nSheldon: Oh, oh, the guy. Oh, pardon me. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t realize you\xe2\x80\x99d spoken to the guy. Yeah, tell me, did the guy choose one with a 4K display and a Thunderbolt port?\nAmy: Yes.\nSheldon: Yeah? Did the guy make sure that this has a one terabyte solid-state drive?\nAmy: Yes.\nSheldon: Yeah? Oh, well, was this guy Rick from Computer Solutions on Colorado?\nAmy: Yes.\nSheldon: Yeah, well, he does know his stuff.\nScene: Howard\xe2\x80\x99s workshop.\nLeonard: After you wrap the body in reflective tape, the ends get Teflon tape so we can get a tight seal.\nPenny: Like this?\nLeonard: Yeah, perfect.\nPenny: Oh.\nLeonard: And it helps to have small, delicate fingers. So don\xe2\x80\x99t be discouraged if you can\xe2\x80\x99t do it as fast as me and Howard.\nHoward: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if we have enough solder to finish these circuit boards.\nLeonard: We had a full spool yesterday.\nHoward: What can I say, I play hard, I solder even harder.\nBernadette: Sometimes he solders at home with his shirt off. It\xe2\x80\x99s like a beer commercial.\nLeonard: Well, we got to make a run to the hardware store.\nPenny: How can you call yourself a scientist and run out of solder?\nLeonard: Well, funny story. So, we have plenty of the 60/40 tin-to-lead ratio solder, but the spools look a lot like the 63/37 tin-to-lead\xe2\x80\xa6\nPenny: Honey, honey, honey, let me stop you. That is, is not a funny story.\nHoward: You want to come with us?\nBernadette: I\xe2\x80\x99m kind of getting into the groove here.\nPenny: Yeah, you guys run to the store and let the women handle the science for a change.\nLeonard: Okay. We\xe2\x80\x99ll be back as soon as we can.\nPenny: Okay, so what is solder?\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: I suppose I should set this up. Or would you like to rob me of that, too?\nAmy: Knock it off or I\xe2\x80\x99ll start making W-H sounds for words that just have a W.\nSheldon: You wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t.\nAmy: Whatch me.\nSheldon: Fine. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. Thank you for the thoughtful gift. I really do appreciate it. As you know, I had become attached to my old laptop. But I\xe2\x80\x99m sure, in time, that this one will\xe2\x80\xa6 Jeepers creepers, that started up fast.\nAmy: I thought you might like it.\nSheldon: Look at the 4K resolution. Next time we Skype, I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna count all those nostril hairs.\nAmy: Or you could just look into my eyes.\nSheldon: But you only have two eyes. You got a lot of nostril hairs.\nAmy: Well, you know, as long as you\xe2\x80\x99re happy.\nSheldon: Oh. I am.\nAmy: And Rick said you could bring in your old one to recycle it.\nSheldon: Oh. Uh, no, no, no, thank you.\nAmy: Oh, but he said you can get store credit.\nSheldon: Well, no, I just, I, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to recycle it. And I don\xe2\x80\x99t want store credit.\nAmy: But why wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\xa6\nSheldon: Can we please change the subject?\nAmy: Okay. How \xe2\x80\x99bout we change it to why you\xe2\x80\x99re being weird about this?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m not being weird. I, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to explain.\nAmy: Sheldon, just tell me.\nSheldon: It might be easier to show you.\nAmy: Okay.\nSheldon: We\xe2\x80\x99d have to take your car.\nAmy: All right.\nSheldon: And I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna need you to sign a non-disclosure agreement.\nAmy: Well, I signed one before we slept together. Why not now?\nScene: A street.\nLeonard: Penny says they\xe2\x80\x99re having fun working on the prototype.\nHoward: Remember when her fun was nightclubs and drinking games?\nLeonard: I know. I\xe2\x80\x99m lowering the bar so slowly. This time next year she\xe2\x80\x99ll have a coin collection.\nMan: Excuse me. You guys interested in a free screening of an upcoming movie?\nLeonard: Oh. Sorry, we can\xe2\x80\x99t.\nHoward: Well, hang on. What movie is it?\nMan: Oh, I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell you. But it does star Will Smith.\nHoward: Wait. I bet it\xe2\x80\x99s Suicide Squad. Let\xe2\x80\x99s check it out.\nLeonard: What about the girls?\nHoward: Penny just said they\xe2\x80\x99re having fun. Honestly, you want to wrap tape around a bunch of pipe fittings all afternoon?\nLeonard: Okay, we\xe2\x80\x99ll take \xe2\x80\x99em. But, I swear, if it\xe2\x80\x99s Will Smith in Shark Tale 2, it better be at least as good as the original.\nScene: Howard\xe2\x80\x99s workshop.\nPenny: I mean, it\xe2\x80\x99s crazy, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? I moved here from Nebraska to be an actress, and now I\xe2\x80\x99m sitting in an engineering lab at Caltech helping to build a prototype for a high-tech guidance system.\nBernadette: It is crazy. It\xe2\x80\x99s also crazy that I\xe2\x80\x99ve made fourteen of these and you\xe2\x80\x99ve made three.\nRaj: Hey. Where are the guys?\nPenny: Oh, they went to the store to get solder, which is metal you melt to make science things.\nBernadette: Since when do you work on weekends?\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99m an astrophysicist. The stars don\xe2\x80\x99t take a day off.\nPenny: You were home alone and had no one to play with?\nRaj: Well, the cleaning lady was there, but she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like me. You need any help?\nBernadette: Not with Lightning McQueen here.\nPenny: I think we\xe2\x80\x99re good.\nRaj: Okay. That\xe2\x80\x99s cool. I guess everybody\xe2\x80\x99s involved in this project but me. So, see ya.\nBernadette: I feel bad. Should we have asked him to stay?\nRaj (from outside): Yes.\nScene: Amy\xe2\x80\x99s car.\nAmy: Will you please tell me where we\xe2\x80\x99re going?\nSheldon: Sorry, you\xe2\x80\x99re on a need-to-know basis.\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99m driving the car. I need to know.\nSheldon: Right.\nAmy: So where are we going?\nSheldon: No, I meant turn right, and you missed it. Maybe you do need to know.\nScene: The cinema.\nLeonard: What are we gonna tell the girls?\nHoward: It\xe2\x80\x99s not a problem.\nLeonard: I mean without lying.\nHoward: And now you\xe2\x80\x99ve made it a problem.\nLeonard: Come on. We\xe2\x80\x99re a couple of smart guys. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure we can come up with a way to explain this that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make us look bad.\nPenny (at Howard\xe2\x80\x99s workshop, reading text): Oh, the boys had to drive all the way to San Bernardino for the solder and got a flat.\nLeonard: They bought it.\nHoward: But we\xe2\x80\x99re gonna have to put the spare on before we go back.\nLeonard: Oh, you\xe2\x80\x99re good at this.\nHoward: Well, I lie a lot.\nMan: Hey, guys, thank you for being a part of our test screening. You\xe2\x80\x99re about to be one of the first audiences to see Suicide Squad.\nLeonard: Hey, you were right.\nHoward: Well, I keep telling you, good things happen to bad people.\nMan: Uh, we\xe2\x80\x99re gonna get started in a couple minutes. Enjoy.\nLeonard: Who are you texting?\nHoward: Raj. He really wants to see this movie.\nLeonard: He\xe2\x80\x99ll never make it in time.\nHoward: I know. I want to make him feel bad.\nLeonard: Ha, ha. Leonard and I are about to see Suicide Squad. Spoiler alert, when I see you I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna spoil it. You\xe2\x80\x99re a good friend.\nRaj (at the workshop): Okay. Would you ladies please leave the room for a moment?\nPenny: Why?\nRaj: I need to rub my genitals on their prototype.\nBernadette: What\xe2\x80\x99s going on?\nRaj: Leonard and Howard don\xe2\x80\x99t have a flat. They went to the movies. Look.\nPenny: Un-freakin\xe2\x80\x99 believable.\nBernadette: Son of a bitch.\nRaj: Oh. You know what? I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna let them know that I\xe2\x80\x99m here with you and that they\xe2\x80\x99re busted.\nPenny: No. You know what? Don\xe2\x80\x99t. Don\xe2\x80\x99t. Let\xe2\x80\x99s let them think they\xe2\x80\x99re getting away with it.\nBernadette: Yeah, let\xe2\x80\x99s see how deep a hole they can dig for themselves.\nPenny: Mm-hmm.\nRaj: Interesting. I mean, it\xe2\x80\x99s not testicles on a cryostat, but I like it.\nScene: A storage facility.\nAmy: Why do you have a storage unit?\nSheldon: Just wait.\nAmy: How long have you had it?\nSheldon: Just wait.\nAmy: Do you want me to hold that computer?\nSheldon: Just wait. You know what? Actually, yes, thank you. Welcome to my Fortress of Shame.\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. What, what am I looking at?\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s basically everything I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever owned. Um, every book, every tee shirt, every piece of broken electronics. Just all of it.\nAmy: All of it?\nSheldon: I have a Ziploc bag filled with all my old Ziploc bags.\nAmy: Okay. Well, I would like to tell you that there is nothing here to be ashamed of. So I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna need a minute.\nScene: Howard\xe2\x80\x99s workshop.\nPenny: All right, how are we gonna play this when they return?\nRaj: I know. You guys should totally be making out with me.\nPenny: Sweetie, I know you think jokes like that are funny, but do you really think you could handle making out with both of us?\nRaj: No, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\nBernadette: Okay. Okay, how about this? They don\xe2\x80\x99t know you\xe2\x80\x99re here with us, so you hide in the closet. When they show up, we\xe2\x80\x99ll hear whatever their dumb story is about where they were, we\xe2\x80\x99ll pretend to believe them and just when they think they got away with it, you jump out.\nPenny: Yeah, that\xe2\x80\x99s pretty good.\nRaj: I love it, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be all like, busted, and they\xe2\x80\x99ll be like, what? And then we\xe2\x80\x99ll all be like, oh yeah. Yeah, I get it. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t make out with me, either.\nScene: The storage unit.\nSheldon: In here is every clock radio I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever owned. Calculators, VHS tapes. Yeah. Oh. Sporting equipment.\nAmy: You have sporting equipment?\nSheldon: Well, oh, it\xe2\x80\x99s just a, it\xe2\x80\x99s a, a golf ball that my brother threw at my head. You can still feel the dent. It\xe2\x80\x99s right next to the hockey puck dent.\nAmy: Okay, why do you have a bin of pine cones?\nSheldon: I used to collect them as a child. The spiral of scales open in the Fibonacci sequence. A fact that, when you tell your brother, gets a golf ball thrown at your head.\nAmy: So, why do you feel you need to save these things?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99d like to say it\xe2\x80\x99s nostalgia, but every time I think of throwing anything away, my ears start to ring, and I get butterflies in my stomach. And then it feels like the butterflies get eaten by rats, and then the, the rats get eaten by\xe2\x80\xa6\nAmy: Okay. I get it. I get it.\nSheldon: It ends with dinosaurs. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry if you think less of me.\nAmy: I don\xe2\x80\x99t.\nSheldon: Really? \xe2\x80\x98Cause every time I come in here, I think less of me.\nAmy: Why?\nSheldon: Because I\xe2\x80\x99m a fraud. No. I purport to be a man of the mind. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been such a, a vocal champion of the singularity, but how can I leave my body behind and become one with the internet when I\xe2\x80\x99ve never even thrown a toothbrush away?\nAmy: It\xe2\x80\x99s okay, Sheldon. You know, I\xe2\x80\x99ve saved a lot of weird things, too.\nSheldon: Like what?\nAmy: Well, um, did you know I have a microscope slide with a little bit of tissue from the first brain I ever dissected?\nSheldon: I have an old teddy bear I secretly wiped my nose on for years.\nAmy: It\xe2\x80\x99s not a contest.\nScene: Howard\xe2\x80\x99s workshop.\nPenny: Okay, here they come.\nBernadette: Go hide.\nRaj: Oh, man, when I come out of the closet, I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna nail those guys. Yeah, I heard it. Shut up.\nLeonard: Hey.\nHoward: Hi.\nPenny: Hey, what\xe2\x80\x99s this?\nLeonard: Listen, we did a stupid thing.\nHoward: We went to a movie and lied about it, but we feel bad and want to make it up to you.\nLeonard: So, these are for you, and if you\xe2\x80\x99re not too mad, we\xe2\x80\x99d love to take you guys to dinner.\nHoward: Yeah. Anywhere you want.\nBernadette: Oh. Well, thank you for being honest.\nPenny: Yeah. You know, I want to be upset, but we did kind of have fun working on the prototype.\nRaj (inside cupboard): Don\xe2\x80\x99t forgive them. Stay mad at them.\nHoward: What is he doing in there?\nRaj: Busting you.\nBernadette: It\xe2\x80\x99s okay. They apologized.\nPenny: Yeah, it\xe2\x80\x99s fine.\nRaj: Well this is kind of anti-climactic.\nHoward: You know what wasn\xe2\x80\x99t anti-climactic? The end of the movie. Get this.\nRaj: No spoilers. No spoilers.\nPenny: And he\xe2\x80\x99s back in the closet.\nHoward: Ready for dinner?\nPenny: Yeah.\nBernadette: Should we invite Raj?\nRaj (in cupboard): Yes.\nScene: The storage unit.\nAmy: So, no one else knows about this?\nSheldon: Only you.\nAmy: Thank you for trusting me.\nSheldon: What good is having a girlfriend if you can\xe2\x80\x99t unload your psychological sewage on her?\nAmy: That\xe2\x80\x99s me, your emotional outhouse. You know, if you ever decide you want to do something about this, I\xe2\x80\x99m, I\xe2\x80\x99m here for you.\nSheldon: Thank you. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t even know how to begin.\nAmy: Baby steps, I guess.\nSheldon: I suppose I could try getting rid of the golf ball.\nAmy: Oh. Okay.\nSheldon: I will always have the dent to remember it by.\nAmy: You did it. Do you feel okay?\nSheldon: Actually, yes. I do.\nAmy: Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m proud of you.\nSheldon: Thanks.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m glad I told you about the storage unit.\nAmy: Well, I feel closer to you now.\nSheldon: Oh, I feel closer to you, too. You know, it\xe2\x80\x99s still a couple of hours until my bedtime.\nAmy: What did you have in mind?\nScene: The same, shortly afterwards.\nSheldon: You look amazing. I mean, this resolution is remarkable.\nAmy (on Skype): I really had to go home for this?\nSheldon: Yes, but it\xe2\x80\x99s like you\xe2\x80\x99re right here in the room.\nAmy: And yet, I\xe2\x80\x99m not.\nSheldon: But I feel like I could reach out and touch you.\nAmy: And yet, you can\xe2\x80\x99t.\nSheldon: I know.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
