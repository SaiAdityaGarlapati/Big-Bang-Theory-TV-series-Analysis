b'Scene: Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom.\nSheldon: Sheldon Cooper\xe2\x80\x99s descent into madness, day two. It\xe2\x80\x99s 2:25 a.m., and I feel the urge to urinate. My normal urination time is 7:10 a.m., but here I am, in the middle of the night, struggling to keep my mind sharp and my pajamas dry. It\xe2\x80\x99s only a matter of time before my tenuous grasp on reality fades. I suppose I should pee while I still know what a toilet is.\nScene: The apartment. 2 days earlier.\nLeonard: Since when do you hum songs?\nSheldon: What are you talking about?\nLeonard: You were just humming.\nSheldon: Are you sure? Sometimes when my brain really gets moving, it makes noise.\nLeonard: How does your brain feel about calculating the surface tension of the domain walls?\nSheldon: Let\xe2\x80\x99s see. Hey, I was humming. One point for Hufflepuff. What song is that?\nLeonard: Well, hum it again. Is that the SpongeBob song?\nSheldon (singing): Who lives in a pineapple. Nope.\nLeonard: Whatever. Can we just get back to this?\nSheldon: I feel like I know what song that is, but I can\xe2\x80\x99t put my finger on it. (Singing) My country, \xe2\x80\x99tis of thee. No.\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s just an earworm. It\xe2\x80\x99ll come to you.\nSheldon: Okay. (Singing) R-E-S-P-E-C-T. No.\nLeonard: Is this what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing the rest of the night?\nSheldon (singing): I\xe2\x80\x99m surprised you have to ask.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon (on phone): Hello, yes, I was hoping you could help me. What song is this? La, la, la, la, la, la, la. You don\xe2\x80\x99t know? Well, how dare you call yourselves a Rock and Roll Hall of Fame? My goodness. Do you sing along to the greatest hits of Elvis Presley with that mouth? Well, they were no help at all.\nLeonard: Which is crazy, since rock and roll is all about good customer service.\nPenny: Yeah. So you have a song stuck in your head. It happens to everybody.\nSheldon: Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not everybody. I have an eidetic memory. I should be able to remember what song this is, but I can\xe2\x80\x99t. Something\xe2\x80\x99s wrong with me.\nPenny: I told you if we were patient, he\xe2\x80\x99d figure it out for himself.\nSheldon: I was always afraid this day would come. This might be the first step of my descent into madness, where I gradually test the limits of public nudity.\nPenny: Public nudity?\nLeonard: Eh, that just means going barefoot.\nScene: Amy\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nDave (voice on phone): Hello?\nAmy: Hi, Dave. Uh, it\xe2\x80\x99s Amy.\nDave: Oh. How are you?\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99m fine. How are you?\nDave: Terrific. And pleasantly surprised to hear from you, given how I acted on our last date.\nAmy: Yeah, well, we both made mistakes, you know. I took the last breadstick, you gushed over my ex-boyfriend like he was Leonard Nimoy and you were my ex-boyfriend.\nDave: So, to what do I owe the pleasure?\nAmy: Well, I was wondering if you\xe2\x80\x99d like to get dinner again sometime.\nDave: Yes, please.\nAmy: Great.\nDave: Let me just check my schedule, he said, trying to seem like a man with things on his schedule.\nAmy: How \xe2\x80\x99bout Saturday?\nDave: Uh, hmm, let me see. Uh, Friday, farmers\xe2\x80\x99 market with Jay Z. Sunday, piano shopping with Elton John. Saturday works.\nScene: Howard\xe2\x80\x99s workshop.\nRaj: Oh. Did you know, at the United Nations, there\xe2\x80\x99s a Department for Outer Space Affairs?\nHoward: Really? Why?\nRaj: They exist in case we ever make contact with an alien civilization.\nHoward: Mm, boy, that\xe2\x80\x99s one of those jobs that\xe2\x80\x99s boring, boring, boring, then, oh, God, where\xe2\x80\x99s the memo with what we do now?\nRaj: Oh, this is cool. So, a few weeks ago I set up a fan page on Facebook for our band and\xe2\x80\xa6\nHoward: Wait a second. How could you do that without consulting me?\nRaj: It\xe2\x80\x99s not a big deal. It just took, like, five minutes to set up.\nHoward: That\xe2\x80\x99s not the point. When we created Footprints on the Moon, we agreed that every band decision would be mutual. Now you\xe2\x80\x99re just trying to take over the whole thing. You know, maybe I should go solo.\nRaj: But someone joined our page. We have an actual fan.\nHoward: All right. This thing\xe2\x80\x99s bigger than you and me, band\xe2\x80\x99s back together.\nRaj: So, listen to what he wrote. Uh, I saw you play at the comic book store. You guys rock. And then there\xe2\x80\x99s an animated smiley face raising the roof like this.\nHoward: We did raise the roof that night.\nRaj: Yeah, we totally did.\nHoward: Why do rock stars do drugs when this feels so great?\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon (singing): Why can\xe2\x80\x99t I recall this song? This is taking far too long. The urge to bang my head against the wall again and again and again and again and again is strong.\nLeonard: Put on some headphones.\nSheldon (singing): No they make my earlobes sweat.\nPenny: Hey, sweetie, why don\xe2\x80\x99t you take a break and do something else for a while?\nSheldon: There was a project I\xe2\x80\x99ve been thinking about starting.\nPenny: Okay, great. What is it?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99ll show you. (Into phone camera) Dear Crazy Future Sheldon, you were driven mad by an earworm. Your mind, once your most trusted asset, is now a sack of parrots and monkeys. So, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to tell you everything you need to know. Uh, first, music is dangerous. The movie Footloose tried to warn us, but we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t listen. Oh, wait. (Singing) Everyody cut footloose. Nope.\nPenny: I\xe2\x80\x99ll pay a thousand dollars to watch you cut footloose.\nSheldon: This is Penny. She is your friend. If she offers you food, it\xe2\x80\x99s safe to take it. You probably paid for it, anyway.\nScene: Amy\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nBernadette: So, you\xe2\x80\x99re really going out with Dave again?\nAmy: Why not? He\xe2\x80\x99s actually a very nice guy.\nBernadette: But he spent an entire date talking about how much he loves Sheldon.\nAmy: That\xe2\x80\x99s nothing Sheldon hasn\xe2\x80\x99t done before. Dave\xe2\x80\x99s just a big fan of his work. Besides, he said he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t bring it up again.\nBernadette: Okay. So where\xe2\x80\x99s he taking you?\nAmy: Oh, he\xe2\x80\x99s coming here. I\xe2\x80\x99m actually making dinner.\nBernadette: Oh. That\xe2\x80\x99s a big step.\nAmy: It is?\nBernadette: Yeah. You\xe2\x80\x99re inviting him into your home. It\xe2\x80\x99s intimate. It\xe2\x80\x99s where your underpants live.\nAmy: You know what? Good. I tried to get back together with Sheldon, he shot me down. Dave likes me. Maybe intimate is what I need.\nBernadette: You sure? You\xe2\x80\x99ve never really been with a man. Do you really want to start with one that\xe2\x80\x99s six-foot-seven?\nAmy: Why not?\nBernadette: \xe2\x80\x98Cause it\xe2\x80\x99s like taking your driver\xe2\x80\x99s test in a bus.\nScene: Howard\xe2\x80\x99s workshop.\nRaj: Maybe we should post a comment back to our fan and thank him.\nHoward: What should we write?\nRaj: How about, uh, oh, how about, we might be Footprints on the Moon, but your kind words sent us over the moon.\nHoward: Someday you\xe2\x80\x99re gonna make an amazing grandma.\nRaj: Well what do you want to write?\nHoward: Something badass, you know, like, thanks for diggin\xe2\x80\x99 our vibe. We\xe2\x80\x99ll keep rockin\xe2\x80\x99 if you keep rollin\xe2\x80\x99.\nRaj: Dude, if I was wearing a bra, I\xe2\x80\x99d throw it at your head right now.\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99ll keep rockin\xe2\x80\x99. You don\xe2\x80\x99t do that.\nRaj: Okay. I posted it.\nHoward: So, who is this guy?\nRaj: Let\xe2\x80\x99s see. Uh, his name is Trent Monaco.\nHoward: Cool name.\nRaj: Yeah. He\xe2\x80\x99s 24. He\xe2\x80\x99s a deejay. He brews his own beer. He\xe2\x80\x99s got awesome tattoos. Dude, he\xe2\x80\x99s got a hot girlfriend, too.\nHoward: Damn. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if he\xe2\x80\x99s our biggest fan or I\xe2\x80\x99m his. Hey, Trent just liked our comment.\nRaj: He is so cool. Hey, no hard feelings, but I\xe2\x80\x99m throwing my hypothetical bra at him.\nScene: Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom. Sheldon is playing his tune on a keyboard in the background.\nPenny: Oh, my God, he won\xe2\x80\x99t stop.\nLeonard: How does he keep coming up with new ways to be annoying?\nPenny: Nobody knows. That\xe2\x80\x99s why he\xe2\x80\x99s number one. Can you please go talk to him?\nLeonard: Come on. I take care of him all day long. You do it for once.\nPenny: Once? Who got the gum out of his hair?\nLeonard: What do you want, a medal? It was your gum.\nPenny: Fine.\nLeonard: I love you.\nPenny: Who cares?\nSheldon (off): What are you doing in my room? Stop it. That\xe2\x80\x99s mine. Why are you so strong?\nPenny: Problem solved.\nLeonard: Oh, yeah, he got a tuba.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Dear Crazy Future Sheldon, this is a thermostat. It controls the temperature of the apartment. The ideal setting is 72 degrees. If you find this too cold, then put on a jacket. A straitjacket, \xe2\x80\x99cause 72\xe2\x80\x99s the best and you\xe2\x80\x99re crazy. Now, this is your spot. You\xe2\x80\x99re very protective of it. When anyone else tries to sit here, you berate them relentlessly. It sounds mean, but somehow you make it adorable. People are also delighted by your love of pranks. For example, Leonard has no idea what I did to his coffee. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t replace it with Folger\xe2\x80\x99s crystals, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you that much.\nLeonard: Hey, can we please get back to work?\nSheldon: This is Leonard. He\xe2\x80\x99s your best friend in the world.\nLeonard: All right, just stop. This is ridiculous.\nSheldon: Sometimes he gets cranky, but you can trust him with your life. And he does more things for you than I can even begin to list.\nLeonard: Thank you.\nSheldon: Oh, no, he\xe2\x80\x99s drinking it.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s house.\nHoward: Look at this. Trent is rebuilding a vintage motorcycle.\nRaj: That is so cool. Old broken things are so much better than new things that work.\nBernadette: Who\xe2\x80\x99s Trent?\nHoward: Oh, he\xe2\x80\x99s our fan.\nBernadette: Fan of what?\nHoward: Uh, did you forget? We\xe2\x80\x99re in a band.\nBernadette: You mean because you played one time in the comic book store?\nHoward: And at the children\xe2\x80\x99s hospital until they asked us to leave.\nRaj: Hey, dude, Trent just checked in at the coffee shop on Fair Oaks.\nHoward: Really? You want to go down there and meet him?\nBernadette: Are you stalking him? That\xe2\x80\x99s creepy.\nRaj: It\xe2\x80\x99s not creepy. I built a Footprints on the Moon fan page, Trent joined it.\nHoward: After that, all I did was check out his profile, go back in the archive of his feed until I found his Twitter handle.\nRaj: From there, it was easy to find him on Instagram, Snapchat and pretty much track his every movement.\nHoward: So if you think that\xe2\x80\x99s creepy, you married the wrong guy.\nBernadette: Maybe I should marry Trent.\nRaj: Yeah, like she could get Trent.\nScene: Amy\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nDave: This is delicious.\nAmy: Thank you.\nDave: Been a long time since I had a home-cooked meal.\nAmy: When you were married, did your wife cook?\nDave: Not at first, no. But when she began cheating on me with a French chef, she became quite the wiz in the kitchen.\nAmy: So, a little silver lining.\nDave: I suppose. Yeah. Nothing takes the sting out of a shattered life like a properly-seasoned bowl of onion soup. How long have you, uh, lived here?\nAmy: Uh, about five years. I\xe2\x80\x99m actually thinking of moving to a better place now that I don\xe2\x80\x99t need to be so close to, well, you know.\nDave: I do. The brilliant physicist that I now know lives in the area, not that I care.\nAmy: Yeah. Anyway, he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t drive, so, I pretty much had to take him everywhere.\nDave: Had to or got to? Sorry.\nAmy: My fault. I brought him up.\nDave: Yeah. Well, let\xe2\x80\x99s change the subject. No more mentions of you-know-who. That\xe2\x80\x99s a cool train. Where did you get that?\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Bah, bam, bum-bum, bah, bum, bum. This song is never going to stop. Have you ever dealt with something so relentlessly irritating?\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99s a trick question, right?\nSheldon: Well, I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be surprised. There\xe2\x80\x99s a rich history of brilliant minds descending into madness.\nPenny: Come on, Sheldon. There are plenty of smart people who don\xe2\x80\x99t have mental problems.\nLeonard: Yup, she\xe2\x80\x99s right. For every Newton who had a psychological issue, there\xe2\x80\x99s an Edison who was just a jerk. That could totally be you.\nSheldon: Empedocles thought he was a god and jumped into a volcano. And Pythagoras had an irrational fear of beans. Tesla fell madly in love with a pigeon who he claimed loved him back.\nPenny: Maybe he just had bread in his pocket.\nSheldon: The list extends outside of science. Painters like Van Gogh and Pollock, chess champion Bobby Fischer, Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys. (Clip of Darling by the Beach Boys) I remember the song. It\xe2\x80\x99s called Darlin\xe2\x80\x99 by the Beach Boys. Oh, thank goodness. I\xe2\x80\x99m not crazy. I don\xe2\x80\x99t have to take a pigeon as my bride.\nLeonard: There goes our shot at him living on the roof.\nScene: A coffee shop.\nRaj: So, all right, there he is. So, should we introduce ourselves?\nHoward: No. Let him spot us.\nRaj: I wonder if he\xe2\x80\x99s listening to our music right now.\nHoward: Could you imagine? What a cool way for us to meet. He\xe2\x80\x99s playing our song and looks up, and there we are, his favorite two-piece acoustic sci-fi novelty rock band.\nRaj: And he\xe2\x80\x99s, all, like, aren\xe2\x80\x99t you the guys from Footprints on the Moo-oo-ooh what is he doing?!\nHoward: I can\xe2\x80\x99t watch.\nRaj: It\xe2\x80\x99s okay. Oh, it\xe2\x80\x99s okay. He\xe2\x80\x99s done.\nHoward: Why is he looking at it?\nRaj: Eh, no, he\xe2\x80\x99s not going to eat it, is he?\nHoward: Come on, Trent, you\xe2\x80\x99re better than th-ah.\nRaj: Ooh!\nHoward: Let\xe2\x80\x99s just go.\nTrent: Hey, aren\xe2\x80\x99t you the guys?\nHoward: Nope.\nRaj: No, never heard of \xe2\x80\x99em!\nScene: The apartment. Sheldon is listening to Darlin\xe2\x80\x99\nSheldon: I wonder why it was this particular song that was stuck in my head.\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. It\xe2\x80\x99s pretty catchy.\nPenny: Do you even like the Beach Boys?\nSheldon: They have beach right in the name. What do you think?\nLeonard: Well, now that you can focus again, what do you say we get back to surface tension of domain walls?\nSheldon: Of course. I\xe2\x80\x99m already seeing a more efficient way of taming the ultravi\xe2\x80\xa6 I know why the song was in my head.\nPenny: Why?\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s about Amy.\nPenny: Okay, look, I know Amy\xe2\x80\x99s like an old lady, but she\xe2\x80\x99s not old enough to have a song from the sixties written about her.\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s about how she made my life better. Consider the lyrics. I was living like half a man. Then I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t love, but now I can. More soul than I ever had. I love the way you soften my life.\xe2\x80\x9d\nPenny: She did soften your life, didn\xe2\x80\x99t she?\nSheldon: Yes. She\xe2\x80\x99s like the dryer sheets of my heart. I have to go.\nLeonard: Aw. Am I like the dryer sheets of your heart?\nPenny: Better. You\xe2\x80\x99re the lint trap of my love.\nLeonard: Aw.\nScene: Amy\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nAmy: That\xe2\x80\x99s an interesting tie clip.\nDave: Oh, thanks. It\xe2\x80\x99s, uh, Avogadro\xe2\x80\x99s constant. It\xe2\x80\x99s useful for calculating the number of atoms in a substance, or causing regret in anyone who asks about it.\nAmy: No, I, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s neat. Oh.\nDave: Sorry. Sorry. No one\xe2\x80\x99s ever liked the tie clip before, so I just lost all control.\nAmy: No, it, it\xe2\x80\x99s okay, and we are on a date. I\xe2\x80\x99m, I\xe2\x80\x99m just a little nervous.\nDave: Well, no need to be nervous with me. I\xe2\x80\x99m just a harmless giant from a foreign land.\nAmy: You know, I\xe2\x80\x99m just being silly. I, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what I\xe2\x80\x99m waiting for.\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Amy? (Knock, knock, knock) Amy? (Knock, knock, knock) Amy?\nAmy: That\xe2\x80\x99s Sheldon.\nDave: You\xe2\x80\x99re kidding. How\xe2\x80\x99s my hair?\nAmy: Sheldon, this, this isn\xe2\x80\x99t a good time.\nSheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t care. Amy, there was a song I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get out of my head. Eventually, I realized the song was about you, and like that earworm, I can\xe2\x80\x99t get you out of my heart. So, what I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to say is, you\xe2\x80\x99re my heartworm. The metaphorical kind, not, not the poodle-killing kind.\nAmy: What?\nDave: If I may, I believe what he\xe2\x80\x99s saying, in a charming and delightful way, is that he loves you and wants you back. Dave Gibbs, huge fan of your work. Don\xe2\x80\x99t mind me.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry; I didn\xe2\x80\x99t realize you were on a date.\nAmy: No, it, it, it\xe2\x80\x99s okay. Keep going?\nSheldon: Amy, if you want to be my girlfriend again, I really want to be your boyfriend.\nAmy: I really want that, too.\nSheldon: Good. Because I love you.\nAmy: I love you, too.\nDave: Kiss her, you brilliant fool.\nSheldon: Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll let you get back to your date.\nAmy: Get back here.\nDave: Okay, then. I\xe2\x80\x99ll, uh, see myself out. Amy, thank you for dinner. Dr. Cooper, pleasure to meet you, sir. Uh, if perhaps sometime you have a spare moment, I\xe2\x80\x99d, uh, love to discuss physics, or shoot the breeze, as you Yanks say. Ah. What a lovely evening.\nAdvertisements'
