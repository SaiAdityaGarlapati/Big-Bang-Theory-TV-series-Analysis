b'Scene: The apartment.\nLeonard: Who wants the last dumpling?\nPenny: Ooh, me.\nSheldon: Penny, a moment. We just had Thai food. In that culture, the last morsel is called the krengjai piece, and it is reserved for the most important and valued member of the group.\nPenny: Thank you all for this high honour.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen pictures of your mother, keep eating.\nHoward: All right, honey, if we\xe2\x80\x99re gonna make the movie, we should go. (Raj stands) This may be hard for you to hear, but when I say honey, I mean my fianc\xc3\xa9e. (Raj whispers to him) Yeah, well, now it means her.\nBernadette: It\xe2\x80\x99s okay if he wants to come.\nHoward: Fine. But next time, we get a sitter.\nPenny: All right, I got to go to work. I\xe2\x80\x99ll walk down with you.\nSheldon: Wait. Uh, which is closer to the new train store in Monrovia, the movie theatre or the Cheesecake Factory?\nHoward: Neither of them are close.\nSheldon: Oh, well, then I guess it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter which one of you drives me. Let\xe2\x80\x99s play a fun guessing game to see who gets to take me. All right, this four-letter word describes either a printer\xe2\x80\x99s type size or a compulsion to eat dirt.\nPenny: Okay, I\xe2\x80\x99m not driving him.\nSheldon: No, Penny, don\xe2\x80\x99t give up, you can get this.\nLeonard: Aren\xe2\x80\x99t you going with Sheldon?\nAmy: No, I have no interest in model trains, stores that sell them, nor their heartbreaking clientele.\nLeonard: Oh. Well, I have some work to do, so\xe2\x80\xa6\nAmy: I can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine that would disturb me. Carry on.\nLeonard: Okay. Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you be more comfortable at home?\nAmy: Not really, no.\nLeonard: All righty then. Guess I\xe2\x80\x99ll just get started.\nAmy: Leonard, please. I don\xe2\x80\x99t need the running commentary.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The apartment. Amy is staring into space.\nLeonard: Amy?\nAmy: Yo.\nLeonard: You okay?\nAmy: Oh, sure.\nLeonard: I thought you were reading.\nAmy: I was. Now I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking about what I read. You all right, Leonard? You seem very uncomfortable.\nLeonard: I, I\xe2\x80\x99m fine.\nAmy: Should I go? I\xe2\x80\x99ve been told sometimes I overstay my welcome.\nLeonard: What, who told you that?\nAmy: Well, most recently my gynaecologist.\nLeonard: Well, you stay as long as you\xe2\x80\x99d like.\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99m glad to hear you say that, because I\xe2\x80\x99m having a wonderful time. Hmm, I said the same thing to my gynaecologist.\nScene: Raj\xe2\x80\x99s car.\nBernadette: What are you going to get at the train store, Sheldon?\nSheldon: Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m not buying anything. They\xe2\x80\x99re having a lecture. H-O gauge railroading. Half the size of O-gauge, but twice the fun. Very controversial topic.\nHoward: Which side do you come down on?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99ll let you know after tonight. Unlike some people, I\xe2\x80\x99m going in with an open mind. Who am I kidding? Of course we all know it\xe2\x80\x99s O-gauge or no gauge.\nHoward: Can you believe grown men sit around and play with toy trains?\nBernadette: That\xe2\x80\x99s pretty big talk for a man with a closet full of magic tricks at his mother\xe2\x80\x99s house.\nHoward: First of all, they\xe2\x80\x99re not tricks, they\xe2\x80\x99re illusions. And, secondly, when we get married, they\xe2\x80\x99re all going up in the attic so you can have that closet for clothes.\nBernadette: Why would I keep clothes at your mother\xe2\x80\x99s house?\nHoward: Well, don\xe2\x80\x99t think of it that way. Once we move in, it\xe2\x80\x99ll be our house.\nBernadette: Is she moving out?\nHoward: Why would she move out? It\xe2\x80\x99s her house.\nBernadette: Hang on. You seriously think I\xe2\x80\x99m going to live with your mother?\nSheldon: Howard, I think I can help here. Yes, Bernadette, that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what he thinks.\nHoward: Why not? It\xe2\x80\x99s a great house, plenty of room, and if we have kids, Mom\xe2\x80\x99s there to help. You know, when she tells the Three Little Pigs story, she actually has hair on her chinny-chin-chin.\nBernadette: I\xe2\x80\x99m not gonna live with your mother. Not now, not ever.\nHoward: Wow, someone obviously has some mommy issues.\nBernadette: Raj, take me home.\nHoward: Don\xe2\x80\x99t listen to her. Go to the movie theatre.\nBernadette: Take me home now.\nHoward: Movie theatre.\nRaj: Mmmmmm.\nSheldon: Okay, everybody calm down. There is a simple solution here. Raj, take me to the train store, and then I don\xe2\x80\x99t care what you people do.\nScene: The apartment.\nAmy: How was your shower?\nLeonard: It was good, good. Just out of curiosity, what time do you usually go to bed?\nAmy: Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m up all night. I\xe2\x80\x99m like a possum. Boy, you were not liked in high school, were you?\nLeonard: Not really. Is that my yearbook?\nAmy: Mm-hmm. Dear Leonard, you\xe2\x80\x99re really good at science. Maybe one day you\xe2\x80\x99ll come up with a cure for being a dork.\nLeonard: Well, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t spray-painting a lightning bolt on my briefcase, I can tell you that.\nAmy: If it makes you feel any better, the only person who signed my yearbook was my mother.\nLeonard: Aw.\nAmy: Dear Amy, self-respect and a hymen are better than friends and fun. Love, Mom.\nSheldon (entering): Well, you can add Jerry\xe2\x80\x99s Junction to the list of train stores Sheldon Cooper will never set foot in again.\nLeonard: Rough night, Casey Jones?\nSheldon: You don\xe2\x80\x99t know the half of it. It was billed as a lively give-and-take on the merits of model train sizes. But it was actually a set-up to intimidate weak-minded spineless rubes into buying H-O starter sets.\nLeonard: What\xe2\x80\x99s in the bag?\nSheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to talk about it. But it\xe2\x80\x99s not a spine,I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you that.\nAmy: Well, I had a delightful evening, Leonard. We should do this again sometime.\nLeonard: Ah, sure. That\xe2\x80\x99d be nice.\nAmy: Glad to hear it. I need someone to accompany me to the wedding of Dr. Moranelli and Dr. Gustufson this Friday. They\xe2\x80\x99re kind of the Brad and Angelina of the primatology department.\nLeonard: Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you rather bring Sheldon?\nAmy: I would, but the last wedding we went to was a disaster. He behaved like a child the entire time.\nSheldon: Not my fault. You said there\xe2\x80\x99d be other scientists there my age.\nAmy: Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter. You\xe2\x80\x99re out, he\xe2\x80\x99s in. No date to the prom, two dates to a wedding. Hmm, how times change.\nSheldon: Ha-ha, you have to go to a wedding.\nScene: Outside Howard\xe2\x80\x99s house. Amy rings the bell.\nHoward (off): I\xe2\x80\x99ll get it!\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Could you get it?\nHoward (off): I said I\xe2\x80\x99m getting it!\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Fine, I\xe2\x80\x99ll get it!\nHoward: I got it! Oh, hi.\nBernadette: Hey. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to fight. I was just surprised when you sprung the whole living-with-your-mom stuff on me.\nHoward: Yeah, well, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry I didn\xe2\x80\x99t run it by you first.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): I don\xe2\x80\x99t know who you\xe2\x80\x99re talking to, but in or out! We don\xe2\x80\x99t need bugs!\nHoward: The bugs only come here because you\xe2\x80\x99re their queen! Listen, how about this. Before we make any kind of decision about where we live, we have a trial run. Stay here for a weekend, see what it\xe2\x80\x99s like.\nBernadette: And your mom would be okay with that?\nHoward: Sure she would. Ma, do you mind if Bernadette stays here this weekend?\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Hey, if she\xe2\x80\x99s willing to give the milk away for free, who am I to say no?\nHoward: See? She\xe2\x80\x99s good with it.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Frankly, after all your sleepovers with the little brown boy, a girl is a big relief!\nScene: The apartment. Sheldon is playing with his train set.\nSheldon: All this years, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been so wrong. The tinier the train, the more concentrated the fun.\nPenny: You\xe2\x80\x99re a brain scientist. Can you explain to me why a brilliant man likes playing with toy trains?\nAmy: Not without cutting his head open, no. How about making my eyes like Cleopatra?\nPenny: Really? For a wedding?\nAmy: Perhaps you\xe2\x80\x99re right. My cheekbones and beckoning pelvis already have a certain hello sailor quality to them.\nLeonard: Ready.\nPenny: Aw. So handsome. Like James Bond.\nSheldon: Better than James Bond, because he\xe2\x80\x99s tinier.\nAmy: I got you this to give to me.\nPenny: Oh, sweetie, guests don\xe2\x80\x99t normally wear corsages to a wedding. That\xe2\x80\x99s more of a prom thing.\nAmy: I never went to my prom. My mom paid my cousin to take me, but he just used the money to buy drugs.\nPenny: Put the corsage on her.\nLeonard: Amy, this is for you.\nAmy: When you\xe2\x80\x99re done copping a feel, that goes on my wrist.\nSheldon: All aboard! Woo-woo! It\xe2\x80\x99s official. I\xe2\x80\x99m an H-O trainiac.\nScene: Howard\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom.\nHoward: So, dinner went nice.\nBernadette: Yeah. Yeah, I guess. Does your mother always cut your meat for you?\nHoward: Only when it\xe2\x80\x99s fatty. Well, don\xe2\x80\x99t be jealous, babe. Someday you\xe2\x80\x99ll get to cut it for me.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Bernadette! I found the extra head for the Waterpik if you want to use it!\nBernadette: I\xe2\x80\x99m okay, Mrs. Wolowitz.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): You sure? I just squirted half a brisket outta my teeth!\nHoward: Hey, Ma, how about a little privacy?\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Oh, I know what that means! Hubba-hubba!\nBernadette: Oh, God.\nHoward: Relax, it\xe2\x80\x99ll be fine.\nBernadette: Okay.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Let me know when you\xe2\x80\x99re done canoodling! Mommy needs a foot rub!\nScene: The wedding.\nAmy: Would you like to dance?\nLeonard: No, thank you. I\xe2\x80\x99m really not much of a dancer.\nAmy: You\xe2\x80\x99re not exactly winning any trophies as a conversationalist, either.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. The bride and groom seem happy.\nAmy: Why shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t they be? They have a feverish night of socially-approved copulation ahead of them. In some cultures, we\xe2\x80\x99d stand outside of their bedroom cheering as they achieved orgasm.\nLeonard: That sounds like a late night, and I have work in the morning, so\xe2\x80\xa6\nAmy: Leonard, you may not have noticed, but I am being a delight here. And you\xe2\x80\x99re not holding up your end of the evening.\nLeonard: Oh, sorry. This wedding just reminds me of my kinda-sorta girlfriend 9,000 miles away.\nAmy: I have a kinda-sorta boyfriend who\xe2\x80\x99s playing with a model train right now, you don\xe2\x80\x99t hear me bitching about it. Leonard, a word of advice, moody self-obsession is only attractive in men who can play guitar and are considerably taller than you.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m not moody. I\xe2\x80\x99m fun.\nAmy: You have any evidence to support that statement?\nLeonard: Well, hey, I\xe2\x80\x99m just as much fun as you are.\nAmy: Really? Are you willing to draw a moustache on your finger as a conversational icebreaker? I am.\nLeonard: Okay, fine, what do you suggest?\nAmy: We just had a lovely meal, the band is on fire, and you\xe2\x80\x99re sitting next to a beautiful woman wearing whorish makeup. Why don\xe2\x80\x99t we head outon the dance floor and see if I can sweat through these dress shields.\nLeonard: Once again, I, I\xe2\x80\x99m really not much of a dancer.\nAmy: Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry, I\xe2\x80\x99ll lead. (They do the Birdie Song dance)\nScene: Howard\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom. Howard is playing with a lightsabre.\nAmy: Howard?\nHoward: Ready for bed?\nBernadette: No. I need to brush my teeth, but your mother\xe2\x80\x99s been in the bathroom for, like, an hour.\nHoward: Oh. Yeah, she sometimes has problems doing her business. Hang on. Ma, give up! Tonight\xe2\x80\x99s not your night!\nMrs Wolowitz (off): You don\xe2\x80\x99t know that! I just sat down!\nHoward: Come on, take a break! Bernadette needs to brush her teeth!\nMrs Wolowitz (off): She can come in and brush her teeth! I\xe2\x80\x99m not embarrassed!\nHoward: Problem solved.\nBernadette: No, it\xe2\x80\x99s not. I\xe2\x80\x99m not going in there.\nHoward: Oh, come on, honey. She\xe2\x80\x99s just sitting in there reading a magazine. You can\xe2\x80\x99t see anything. I go in all the time.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Ha! The eagle has landed!\nHoward: And we have splashdown. Wait here, I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna go light a candle. And then we make passionate love.\nScene: The stairwell. Amy is helping Leonard up the stairs.\nAmy: There we go, last floor.\nLeonard: I just can\xe2\x80\x99t figure out what happened. I put my left leg in, I took my left leg out, I put my left leg in, and something just snapped.\nAmy: The hokey pokey is a young man\xe2\x80\x99s game.\nLeonard: I did have a great time. Thank you for reminding me it\xe2\x80\x99s okay to have fun once in a while.\nAmy: You\xe2\x80\x99re welcome.\nLeonard: And also for breaking the head off the ice swan so I could hold it against my pulled groin.\nAmy: I excel at spatial reasoning, and I had a hunch that the graceful slope of its neck would cradle your genitals nicely.\nLeonard: Well, okay. Again, thank you.\nAmy: And again, you\xe2\x80\x99re welcome.\nLeonard: Want to come in, have a cup of tea?\nAmy: No, thanks. I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna head home.\nLeonard: Okay. Well, good night.\nAmy: Good night. (Heads across corridor and knocks on Penny\xe2\x80\x99s door)\nPenny: Ames, hi. How was the wedding?\nAmy: Great. Until I accidentally made Leonard fall in love with me.\nPenny: Come in, let\xe2\x80\x99s talk. Do you want a glass of wine?\nAmy: Wine is one of the reasons I\xe2\x80\x99m in this fix. That and this dang pelvis.\nPenny: Okay, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, what exactly happened?\nAmy: The inevitable, he was lonely and vulnerable from missing his girlfriend, while I was charming, supportive and, let\xe2\x80\x99s face it, in this dress, the perfect combination of Madonna and whore.\nPenny: Oh, God, did he make a move on you?\nAmy: No, but it\xe2\x80\x99s only a matter of time. How could I have not seen this coming? Now I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna have to break the little sad sack\xe2\x80\x99s heart.\nPenny: Yeah, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure he\xe2\x80\x99ll be okay.\nAmy: Oh, Penny, much as I would treasure knowing that the two of us had been defiled by the same man, Leonard just doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get my motor running.\nPenny: So, um, what are you gonna do? Do you want me to talk to Leonard, let him down easy?\nAmy: No. I\xe2\x80\x99ll let him have tonight. Then in the morning, I\xe2\x80\x99ll send him an e-mail letting him know this body is never gonna be his wonderland. I mean, frankly, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got a better shot than he does.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Leonard. Check it out. I bought an N-gauge locomotive. Half the size of H-O. Look, it fits in my mouth.\nLeonard: Sounds like you had a great night.\nSheldon: I did. How was yours?\nLeonard: Not bad. I had a lot more fun with Amy than I thought I would.\nSheldon: What exactly do you mean by that?\nLeonard: Well, it turns out she really knows how to help a guy loosen up and have a good time. Although, truth be told, my groin\xe2\x80\x99s a little worse for wear. (Sheldon hits him) Ow! Why did you do that?\nSheldon: To send a message. She is not for you.\nLeonard: What?\nSheldon: Not for you!\nScene: Howard\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom.\nBernadette: Good morning, handsome.\nHoward: Morning, Mom.\nBernadette: It\xe2\x80\x99s me.\nHoward: Yes, it is, and you\xe2\x80\x99re so pretty in the morning.\nBernadette: Your mom and I made you breakfast.\nHoward: Oh, wow. So you guys are getting along?\nBernadette: Yeah, I guess. We\xe2\x80\x99re very different people, Howard, so communication\xe2\x80\x99s a little tricky.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Does he like the pancakes?!\nBernadette (in a similar voice): He didn\xe2\x80\x99t try them yet!\nHoward: Is there any butter?\nBernadette: It\xe2\x80\x99s butter-flavoured syrup.\nHoward: Oh.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): So, what\xe2\x80\x99s the word?\nBernadette: He wants butter!\nMrs Wolowitz (off): It\xe2\x80\x99s butter-flavoured syrup\nBernadette: I just told him that!\nHoward: I don\xe2\x80\x99t need any butter.\nBernadette: If you want butter, I\xe2\x80\x99ll get you butter.\nHoward: Well, I guess I\xe2\x80\x99ll cut these by myself.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
