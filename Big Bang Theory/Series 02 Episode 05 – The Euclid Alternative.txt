b'Scene: The apartment. Leonard enters, drops his keys in the bowl by the door, then collapses onto the settee. Sheldon enters from the bedroom area.\nSheldon: Good morning, Leonard.\nLeonard: Uh-huh.\nSheldon: Yeah, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to stop by Pottery Barn on the way to work, I bought these Star Wars sheets but they turned out to be much too stimulating to be compatible with a good night\xe2\x80\x99s sleep. I don\xe2\x80\x99t like the way Darth Vader stares at me.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to work.\nSheldon: Oh, just because your career\xe2\x80\x99s been stagnant for a few years, that\xe2\x80\x99s no reason to give up.\nLeonard: Sheldon, I was up all night using the new free-electron laser for my X-ray diffraction experiment.\nSheldon: Did the laser accidentally burn out your retinas?\nLeonard: No.\nSheldon: Then you can drive. Let\xe2\x80\x99s go.\nLeonard: Didn\xe2\x80\x99t I tell you I\xe2\x80\x99d be working nights, and that you\xe2\x80\x99d have to make other arrangements.\nSheldon: You did.\nLeonard: And?\nSheldon: I didn\xe2\x80\x99t. Let\xe2\x80\x99s go.\nLeonard: Goodnight, Sheldon.\nSheldon: But how am I going to get to work?\nLeonard: Take the bus.\nSheldon: I can\xe2\x80\x99t take the bus any more. They don\xe2\x80\x99t have seatbelts. And they won\xe2\x80\x99t let you lash yourself to the seat with bungee cords.\nLeonard: You tried to lash yourself to the seat with bungee cords?\nSheldon: I didn\xe2\x80\x99t try, I succeeded. For some reason it alarmed the other passengers and I was asked to de-bus.\nLeonard: Oh, you\xe2\x80\x99re a big boy, you\xe2\x80\x99ll figure it out.\nSheldon: Don\xe2\x80\x99t talk to me like I\xe2\x80\x99m a child. Now, take me to return my star wars sheets!\nScene: Outside Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\n  Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Penny, (knock, knock, knock) Penny, (knock, knock, knock) Penny\xe2\x80\xa6\nPenny (opening door): Sheldon, what is it?\nSheldon: Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s asleep.\nPenny: Thanks for the update (begins to close door.)\nSheldon: No, wait. You have to drive me to work.\nPenny: Yeah, uh, I really don\xe2\x80\x99t think I do.\nSheldon: But I don\xe2\x80\x99t drive, and I can\xe2\x80\x99t take the bus.\nPenny: Yeah, honey, you\xe2\x80\x99ll be fine as long as you don\xe2\x80\x99t do that bungee cord thing, okay?\nSheldon: Penny. Didn\xe2\x80\x99t you recently state that you and I are friends?\nPenny: Yes, Sheldon, we are friends.\nSheldon: Then I hereby invoke what I\xe2\x80\x99m given to understand is an integral part of the implied covenant of friendship. The favour.\nPenny: Oh, dear God.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t realize I was interrupting your morning prayers. When you\xe2\x80\x99re done, we\xe2\x80\x99ll go.\nCredits sequence.\n  Scene: Inside Penny\xe2\x80\x99s car.\nSheldon: Thank you for driving me to work.\nPenny: You know this is my day off, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Oh, good. I\xe2\x80\x99m not keeping you from anything. Your check engine light is on.\nPenny: Mm-hmm.\nSheldon: Typically that\xe2\x80\x99s an indicator. To, you know, check your engine.\nPenny: It\xe2\x80\x99s fine, it\xe2\x80\x99s been on for, like, a month.\nSheldon: Well, actually, that would be all the more reason to, you know, check your engine.\nPenny: Sheldon, it\xe2\x80\x99s fine.\nSheldon: If it were fine, the light wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be on. That\xe2\x80\x99s why the manufacturer installed that light, to let you know it\xe2\x80\x99s not fine.\nPenny: Uh, maybe the light\xe2\x80\x99s broken.\nSheldon: Is there a \xe2\x80\x9ccheck the check engine light light\xe2\x80\x9d? (Penny takes a drink of coffee) O-o-o-oh!\nPenny: What?\nSheldon: Studies have shown that performing tasks such as eating, talking on a cell phone or drinking coffee while driving reduces one\xe2\x80\x99s reaction time by the same factor as an ounce of alcohol.\nPenny: Do you have any alcohol?\nSheldon: Of course not.\nPenny: Too bad.\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re going up Euclid Avenue?\nPenny: Mm-hmm.\nSheldon: Leonard takes Los Robles Avenue.\nPenny: Well, good for Leonard.\nSheldon: Euclid Avenue is shorter as the crow flies, but it has speed bumps, which appreciably increase point-to-point drive time, making it the less efficient choice. But you have the conn. Of course, if you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to slow down for the speed bumps, I withdraw my previous objection. Here\xe2\x80\x99s a fun question. Do you know what the most common street name is?\nPenny: No.\nSheldon: The answer\xe2\x80\x99s tricky. It\xe2\x80\x99s Second Street. You see, you\xe2\x80\x99d think it would be First Street, but in most towns, First Street eventually gets renamed to something else, you know, like Main Street, Broad Street, Michigan Avenue. Leonard and I often use our commute time to exercise our minds  with brain-teasers like that. We also play games. Would you like to play one?\nPenny: No.\nSheldon: Oh, come on, it\xe2\x80\x99s fun. Ooh! Another bump. Okay. I\xe2\x80\x99ll say an element, and uh, you say an element whose name starts with the last letter of the one I said, okay? I\xe2\x80\x99ll start. Helium. Now, you could say Mercury. That would give me a Y. Ooh.  Very clever, that\xe2\x80\x99s a tough one. So I go Ytterbium, which gets you back to M. So you go Molybdenum, and I say Magnesium, you say Manganese, and  I say Europium, and, and you\xe2\x80\x99re left with Mendelevium, and  there are no more M\xe2\x80\x99s because I believe that Meitnerium should still be called Ekairidium, so congratulations, you win. Do you wanna go again?\nPenny: How about we just have a little quiet time now?\nSheldon: All right. Hmm, huh, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, I\xe2\x80\x99m finding your reckless nonchalance regarding the check-engine light to be very troubling.\nPenny (Pulling over): Get out.\nSheldon: Well, I have to tell you that while I do have a theoretical understanding of the workings of an internal combustion engine, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure I\xe2\x80\x99m capable of performing diagnostics.\nPenny: I said, get out.\nSheldon: Okay. I\xe2\x80\x99ll give it a shot. (Gets out. Penny drives away.)\nScene: The university cafeteria. Sheldon enters.\n  Sheldon: Oh, Leonard, there you are, I\xe2\x80\x99m ready to go home.\nLeonard: I just got here.\nSheldon: Good, perfect timing.\nLeonard: Sheldon, I told you, I only have access to the free-electron laser at night. I can\xe2\x80\x99t drive you for the next few weeks.\nSheldon: No, you said you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t drive me to work, this is from work.\nLeonard: Howard, help me out here.\nHoward: No, just for the fun of it, I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna take his side.\nSheldon: Now, how do you propose I get home?\nLeonard: How did you get here in the first place?\nSheldon: Penny. But I sense that\xe2\x80\x99s no longer an option.\nLeonard: Look, I need to get to the laser lab, you\xe2\x80\x99re just going to have to find someone else to take you home.\nHoward: Oh damn, I picked the wrong side.\nScene: Howard\xe2\x80\x99s motor scooter. Howard is driving, Sheldon is on the back clutching him for dear life and screaming.\n  Sheldon: Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa! Oh God, not Euclid Avenue! Aaaaaaaaaaaaaa!\nScene: Raj\xe2\x80\x99s car.\n  Raj: Why did Howard leave you in the middle of the road anyway?\nSheldon: We had a difference of opinion.\nRaj: Over what?\nSheldon: Whether or not he was trying to kill me. For the record, I maintain he was. Where are you going?\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99m taking you home.\nSheldon: Oh, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not going home. It\xe2\x80\x99s Wednesday, Wednesday is new comic book day, we have to go to the comic book store. And then we have to stop at Soup Plantation, it\xe2\x80\x99s creamy tomato soup day, and Radio Shack, there\xe2\x80\x99s a sale on triple-a batteries. Plus, we have to go to Pottery Barn and return my Star Wars sheets.\nRaj: I have a better idea.\nSheldon: You want to go to pottery barn first?\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment, she opens the door, Sheldon is stood outside with his Star Wars sheets.\n  Sheldon: Can you drive me to Pottery Barn? (She closes the door) Maybe if I turn off the night-light, I can keep the sheets.\nScene: The apartment. Sheldon enters from the bedroom area. Everyone else is present.\n  Sheldon: Good morning.\nAll: Good morning.\nLeonard: Sheldon, sit down.\nSheldon: She\xe2\x80\x99s in my spot. Don\xe2\x80\x99t look at me like that, everybody knows that my spot.\nPenny: Sheldon, you know  that we care about you.\nHoward: And it\xe2\x80\x99s because we care about you that we\xe2\x80\x99ve decided we have to speak up.\nPenny: You\xe2\x80\x99re hurting the people around you, sweetie.\nLeonard: So we made you an appointment, and we want you to keep it.\nSheldon: Department of motor vehicles new driver handbook? But I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a problem.\nLeonard: Sheldon, you need to learn how to drive.\nHoward: This madness has to stop.\nLeonard: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s taking you to the DMV, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to bed.\nSheldon: Why Penny?\nLeonard: Because rock breaks scissors, goodnight.\nPenny: All right, come on Sheldon.\nSheldon: Hold on, I have one condition.\nPenny: What?\nSheldon: We have to stop at Pottery Barn.\nPenny: Okay.\nSheldon: And Radio Shack.\nPenny: Fine.\nSheldon: And the comic book store.\nPenny: All right! (They leave.)\nHoward: Ooh, I want to go to the comic book store. (He leaves.)\nRaj: I like comic books.\nScene: The DMV.\n  Sheldon: I just don\xe2\x80\x99t see why I need a driver\xe2\x80\x99s license, Albert Einstein never had a driver\xe2\x80\x99s license.\nHoward: Yeah, but Albert Einstein didn\xe2\x80\x99t make me wet myself at 40 miles an hour.\nPenny: Yeah, and I never wanted to kick Albert Einstein in the nuts. You know, I gotta ask, why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you just get a license at 16 like everybody else?\nSheldon: I was otherwise engaged.\nPenny: Doing what?\nSheldon: Examining perturbative amplitudes in n=4 supersymmetric theories leading to a re-examination of the ultraviolet properties of multi-loop n=8 supergravity using modern twistor theory.\nPenny: Well, how \xe2\x80\x99bout when you were 17?\nDMV Lady (to the person ahead of Sheldon in the queue): Take this to the testing area, put your name at the top, sign the bottom, answer the questions, bring it back, next! (Sheldon moves forward) Application?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m actually more of a theorist.\nHoward: The application in your hand, give it to her.\nSheldon: Oh.\nDMV Lady: Take this to the testing area, put your name at the top, sign the bottom, answer the questions, bring it back, next!\nSheldon: Excuse me, but I have some concerns about these questions.\nDMV Lady: Look at that sign up there.\nSheldon: Yes?\nDMV Lady: Does it say I give a damn?\nSheldon: No.\nDMV Lady: That\xe2\x80\x99s because I don\xe2\x80\x99t.\nSheldon: Just, look, see, this first question makes no sense, how many car lengths should you leave in front of you when driving? There\xe2\x80\x99s no possible way to answer that, a car length is not a standardized unit of measure.\nDMV Lady: Look at the sign.\nPenny: Sheldon, it\xe2\x80\x99s C, just put down C.\nSheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t need your help, Penny.\nDMV Lady: Listen to that little girl, honey, put C. Next!\nSheldon: No, no, wait, no, hang on, look at this next question.\nHoward: Sheldon, why are you arguing with the DMV?\nSheldon: How else are they going to learn? Look, question 2, when are roadways most slippery? Now, okay, there are three answers, none of which are correct. The correct answer is, when covered by a film of liquid sufficient to reduce the coefficient of static friction between the tire and the road to essentially zero, but not so deep as to introduce a new source of friction.\nDMV Lady: Here\xe2\x80\x99s your learner\xe2\x80\x99s permit. Go away.\nSheldon: But I\xe2\x80\x99m not done. I have many additional concerns about these questions.\nDMV Lady: Don\xe2\x80\x99t make me climb over this counter.\nPenny: Come on, let\xe2\x80\x99s go.\nDMV Lady: Next!\nSheldon: Aced it.\nScene: The apartment. Howard is setting up a large kit of high tech equipment.\n  Howard: Okay, that\xe2\x80\x99s it, let\xe2\x80\x99s boot it up.\nLeonard: Booting.\nHoward: This is a state-of-the-art simulator. I adapted it from something a friend of mine designed for the army.\nSheldon: Is that why I appear to be in downtown Fallujah, behind the wheel of an up-armored Humvee?\nHoward: I haven\xe2\x80\x99t configured it yet. Let\xe2\x80\x99s see\xe2\x80\xa6 Bradley tank\xe2\x80\xa6 transport truck\xe2\x80\xa6  Batmobile\xe2\x80\xa6\nSheldon: Ooh!\nLeonard: No.\nHoward: Here we go, red 2006 Ford Taurus on the streets of Pasadena.\nSheldon (sucking in breath): Hmmmm?\nHoward: What?\nSheldon: Statistically, red cars are stopped by police far more often than any other colour. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want any hassles with the fuzz.\nHoward: Fine, what colour do you want?\nSheldon: You know the pale blue of Luke Skywalker\xe2\x80\x99s lightsaber, before it was digitally remastered?\nHoward: Black it is.\nLeonard: Okay, now, what you want to do first is turn on the ignition and shift into drive.\nSheldon: I haven\xe2\x80\x99t fastened my seat belt yet.\nLeonard: Okay, fasten your seat belt.\nSheldon: Click. Now, are there air bags?\nLeonard: You don\xe2\x80\x99t need air bags.\nSheldon: What if a simulated van rear-ends me?\nPenny: I\xe2\x80\x99ll hit you in the face with a pillow.\nLeonard: Okay, now shift into drive, pull out slowly into traffic.\n(General panic)\n  Penny: Oh.\nLeonard: Oh.\nHoward: Oh.\nLeonard: Watch out.\nHoward: Oh God!\nLeonard: Watch, watch out, watch out for pedestrians!\nPenny: Oh God, wait, slow, hit the brakes, hit the brakes!\n(Sounds of car crashing. Penny hits Sheldon in face with pillow.)\nSheldon: Thank you.\nScene: The same, only Sheldon and Leonard are present. Sheldon is practicing. There are sounds of squealing tyres and brakes and general panic and mayhem.\n  Sheldon: Sorry\xe2\x80\xa6 excuse me\xe2\x80\xa6 my bad\xe2\x80\xa6 student driver\xe2\x80\xa6\nLeonard: How did you manage to get on the second floor of the Glendale galleria?\nSheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I was on the Pasadena freeway, I missed my exit, flew off the overpass, and one thing led to another.\nLeonard: Maybe you want to give it a rest and try again tomorrow.\nSheldon: No. I quit. (Stands up. There is more sound of crashing and panic, then animal noises.)\nLeonard: Aw, the pet store?\nSheldon: Remind me to compliment Wolowitz on the software, it\xe2\x80\x99s amazingly detailed.\nLeonard: So wait,you\xe2\x80\x99re just gonna give up?\nSheldon: No, I\xe2\x80\x99m not giving up, I never give up.\nLeonard: So what is it you\xe2\x80\x99re doing?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m transcending the situation. I\xe2\x80\x99m clearly too evolved for driving.\nLeonard: What does that mean?\nSheldon: Leonard, have you ever wondered why my little toes and lateral incisors are significantly smaller than the average for someone of my size?\nLeonard: I wonder a lot of things about you, Sheldon, but not\xe2\x80\xa6 not that.\nSheldon: Well, those are indicators that I\xe2\x80\x99m farther along the evolutionary scale than the average human.\nLeonard: No kidding.\nSheldon: Well, no, no, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to go so far as to say that I represent a distinct new stage in humankind, you know, a Homo Novus, if you will, no, that\xe2\x80\x99s for anthropologists to decide. But I am convinced that the reason I cannot master the plebeian task of driving is because I\xe2\x80\x99m not meant to.\nLeonard: Yes, you are, you\xe2\x80\x99re meant to learn how to drive. Please learn how to drive!\nSheldon: No, no. Leonard, I\xe2\x80\x99m meant for greater things, like unraveling the mysteries of the universe, not determining when it\xe2\x80\x99s safe to pass a stopped school bus on a country road.\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s never safe.\nSheldon: Yeah, well, I know that now.\nLeonard: Fine. Assuming that everything you say is true, how does the biologically superior Homo Novus get to work tomorrow morning?\nSheldon: Homo Novus doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know.\nLeonard: Well, hang in there, maybe you\xe2\x80\x99ll evolve into something with wings.\nScene: A corridor in the university. Sheldon emerges from his office in a shower cap and bathrobe. The others are turning the corner.\n  Sheldon: Good morning, gentlemen.\nLeonard: Hey.\nRaj: Good morning. Is there some new kind of casual Friday I don\xe2\x80\x99t know about?\nLeonard: No, he lives here now.\nHoward: Really? Why?\nLeonard: Well, since he won\xe2\x80\x99t take the bus and he\xe2\x80\x99s too evolved to drive, he decided it would be easier to just sleep in his office and shower in the radiation lab until I\xe2\x80\x99m finished with my experiment.\nRaj: But you finished your experiment a week ago.\nLeonard: Yep\nScene: The cafeteria, late at night. Two cleaning ladies enter and find a plate with toast crusts.\n  Cleaning Lady 1 (in Spanish, subtitles): Oh my God, again?\nCleaning Lady 2: It must be rats.\nCleaning Lady 1: Rats don\xe2\x80\x99t make toast and cut off the crust.\n  (They are startled by a noise. One of them drops the plate, it smashes on the floor. Sheldon is by the drink machine, he is wearing a cloak with a hood)\n  Sheldon: You saw nothing! (Sweeps hood around himself and vanishes through cafeteria door.)\nADVERTISEMENT\nAdvertisements\nREPORT THIS AD\nREPORT THIS AD'
