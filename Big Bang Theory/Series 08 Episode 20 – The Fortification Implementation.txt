b'Scene: The cafeteria.\nRaj: You\xe2\x80\x99re wrong.\nHoward: No, I\xe2\x80\x99m not.\nRaj: Yes, you are.\nHoward: No, I\xe2\x80\x99m not. Settle this. Those little animated pictures on the Internet, are they called gifs or jifs?\nLeonard: Well, the G stands for graphics. That\xe2\x80\x99s a hard G, so I\xe2\x80\x99d say gif.\nRaj: The guy who invented it says it\xe2\x80\x99s jif.\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, do you mean the guy or the juy?\nSheldon: Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you three guesses why I\xe2\x80\x99m so irritated.\nHoward: Something happened different from the way you wanted it.\nSheldon: I guess news travels fast. It\xe2\x80\x99s true, a select group of scientists was invited to a weekend symposium at a former home of Richard Feynman, and I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t included.\nLeonard: Oh, Sheldon, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure it\xe2\x80\x99s not because they don\xe2\x80\x99t think you\xe2\x80\x99re an elite scientist.\nHoward: Yeah, I bet you anything it\xe2\x80\x99s just \xe2\x80\x99cause you\xe2\x80\x99re a pain in the ass.\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re just saying that to make me feel better.\nLeonard: Look, you can spend the rest of the day being bitter about this.\nSheldon: Agreed.\nLeonard: I was gonna say or, but why bother?\nCredits sequence.\nScene: Mrs Wolowitz\xe2\x80\x99s house.\nBernadette: Hey, Raj.\nRaj: Hey, I got you a little gift.\nBernadette: Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of Girl Scout Cookies.\nRaj: You know me. I\xe2\x80\x99m from India. I can\xe2\x80\x99t resist children begging. So, how\xe2\x80\x99s it going with the title to the house?\nHoward: Great, it\xe2\x80\x99s all done. The lawyer tracked down my father and got him to sign it over. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t have to meet him, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t have to talk to him, I don\xe2\x80\x99t even know where he is.\nRaj: Wow, so you\xe2\x80\x99re not curious at all?\nHoward: Nope.\nRaj: Hmm. What if he\xe2\x80\x99s in prison? What if he\xe2\x80\x99s a spy? What if he\xe2\x80\x99s in a Beatles cover band? I\xe2\x80\x99m just saying, if he\xe2\x80\x99s got your nose and haircut, he\xe2\x80\x99d make a killer Ringo.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nWil Wheaton: Thanks again for agreeing to do this.\nPenny: Oh, it\xe2\x80\x99s cool, I\xe2\x80\x99ve never been on a podcast before.\nLeonard: Well, you picked a good one to start. Wil\xe2\x80\x99s had lots of great guests. Jonathan Frakes, Brent Spiner, Michael Dorn, Gates McFadden.\nPenny: Those are Star Trek people.\nLeonard: Yes.\nPenny: I only figured that out because I\xe2\x80\x99ve never heard of any of them.\nWil: I deserve that. I invited you on my show and I drove here.\nPenny: Sorry.\nWil: Okay, so, this is basically gonna be just like a little talk show. Uh, we\xe2\x80\x99re gonna take some calls, we\xe2\x80\x99ll talk about what it was like on the set of Serial Ape-ist 2. It should be really fun.\nLeonard: This is exciting.\nPenny: Yeah, so, how many people listen?\nWil: Most people download it later, but usually a few thousand people listen live.\nPenny: What? A few thousand people listen to you talk about nerd stuff?\nWil: Again, right in the ears, straight to the feelings.\nScene: The apartment.\nAmy: Can you please pass the salt?\nSheldon: Sure. It\xe2\x80\x99s not like I was invited to Richard Feynman\xe2\x80\x99s house and have anything better to do.\nAmy: Is this how the rest of the night\xe2\x80\x99s going to be?\nSheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the future. Do you think there\xe2\x80\x99s a chance that an asteroid could hit the Earth, destroying Feynman\xe2\x80\x99s house and everyone in it?\nAmy: No, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Then buckle up, you\xe2\x80\x99re in for a cranky night.\nAmy: According to the codicil of the Relationship Agreement which you insisted upon, we\xe2\x80\x99re not allowed to pout or be moody on date night.\nSheldon: You know I just put that in because of uterus stuff.\nAmy: Well, it applies to you, too.\nSheldon: I was afraid you might bring this up, so I have a work-around. There you go. As far as you\xe2\x80\x99re concerned, I\xe2\x80\x99m smiling. Although, I must admit, I\xe2\x80\x99m smiling a little bit at the moment because this loophole is so brilliant.\nScene: Mrs Wolowitz\xe2\x80\x99s house.\nRaj: So, Bernadette, have you thought about how you\xe2\x80\x99re going to redecorate this place?\nBernadette: You know, I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking ripping up the carpets, maybe lose the wallpaper, all new light fixtures.\nRaj: You know, if you knocked out this wall, it would give you an open floor plan, and then, it\xe2\x80\x99s a little scary, but could be fun, indoor fire pit.\nHoward: Hey, I grew up in this house, okay? No one\xe2\x80\x99s knocking anything down.\nBernadette: Okay, okay. When he\xe2\x80\x99s at Comic-Con, I\xe2\x80\x99m bringing in a wrecking ball.\nHoward (answering door): Can I help you?\nGuy at door: Hi. Are you Howard Wolowitz?\nHoward: Yes.\nGuy: Um, this is a little weird, but a lawyer was trying to contact my father, because his name was still on the title for this house.\nHoward: Wuh, uh, who\xe2\x80\x99s your father?\nGuy: Sam Wolowitz.\nHoward: Sam Wolowitz is my father.\nGuy: I know.\nHoward: Well, wait, so if we have the same father, are, are you saying you\xe2\x80\x99re my half-brother?\nGuy: I think so.\nHoward: Bernadette, weird things are happening out here.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nPenny: I think I started to suspect it was a bad movie when I looked at the script and saw the title, Serial Ape-ist 2: Monkey See, Monkey Kill.\nWil: Uh, spoiler alert, after the monkey sees, it kills.\nLeonard: Psst.\nWil: I\xe2\x80\x99ve just been handed a note. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to read it. Wil, do you want more Diet Coke? Also, we have juice.\nLeonard: I, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to interrupt.\nWil: Uh, that voice you just heard belongs to Leonard, Penny\xe2\x80\x99s fianc\xc3\xa9. Uh, Leonard, why don\xe2\x80\x99t you grab some headphones and join us?\nLeonard: Really?\nWil: Yeah.\nLeonard: Hey, great.\nWil: So, while Leonard gets set up, let\xe2\x80\x99s take a call. Hello, caller, you are on with Penny and Wil from Serial Ape-ist 2.\nCaller: I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a question. I just want to say I\xe2\x80\x99m a big fan of the movie. I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen it, like, ten times.\nPenny: Okay, well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll apologize for the first time, but the other nine are on you.\nWil: Thanks a lot, caller. You know that the movie actually has a little bit of a cult following.\nPenny: Really?\nWil: Yeah. I was at a science-fiction convention, and I saw a woman dressed as your half-ape character.\nLeonard: Oh, if she was with an Indian guy dressed like a banana, that was just my friends, Howard and Raj.\nWil: All right, it\xe2\x80\x99s time for a very special guest caller, a friend of mine, who you probably know as the director of such movies as Clerks, or from podcasts and books where he often reminds you that he\xe2\x80\x99s the guy who directed Clerks. Hello, Kevin Smith.\nKevn: Hey, man, yo, is everything okay, Wil? \xe2\x80\x98Cause it\xe2\x80\x99s been, like, two minutes and you haven\xe2\x80\x99t even brought up Stand By Me.\nPenny: Hey, Kevin. It\xe2\x80\x99s really exciting to talk to you.\nLeonard: It really is.\nKevin: Oh, you guys are very sweet. So, Penny, listen, I saw your movie.\nPenny: Oh, wow. I wish it was better.\nWil: Oh, don\xe2\x80\x99t worry about it. Have you seen some of Kevin\xe2\x80\x99s films?\nKevin: You\xe2\x80\x99re cruisin\xe2\x80\x99 for a beatin\xe2\x80\x99, Wheaton. Anyway, man, I dug the ape movie, Penny. And I thought you were, like, really great in it.\nPenny: Aw.\nWil: You know, I\xe2\x80\x99m in the movie, too.\nKevin: Yeah, whatever. Penny. Penny, how come you\xe2\x80\x99re not in more stuff, man? I\xe2\x80\x99d cast you in a minute.\nPenny: Seriously?\nKevin: Oh, yeah, man. I\xe2\x80\x99m actually in pre-production on a movie right now. Way different than anything I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever done before. It\xe2\x80\x99s called Clerks 3. You should come over and read for a part.\nPenny: Oh, my, I would love that.\nLeonard: You have a new job.\nPenny: Well, maybe I can do both.\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you can do both.\nPenny: I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I asked you.\nKevin: Yeah, you tell him, Penny.\nLeonard: Stay out of it, Kevin Smith.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Do you think there comes a point in life when it stops feeling bad to be left out of things?\nAmy: Probably not. It\xe2\x80\x99s an evolutionary advantage to be included in group activities.\nSheldon: You know what? I used to be a fan of evolution, but I\xe2\x80\x99ve since evolved, and now I think it\xe2\x80\x99s dumb.\nAmy: Being left out is a terrible feeling. No one understands that better than I do.\nSheldon: Hey, look at that. Even in your example, you\xe2\x80\x99re all by yourself.\nAmy: When there was a lice epidemic at my school, everybody got it except me. I tried to fool everyone by sprinkling sugar in my hair, but I just got attacked by bees.\nSheldon: I can just picture them all right now at Feynman\xe2\x80\x99s house, probably discussing Schrodinger and at the same time, not discussing Schrodinger. See? They\xe2\x80\x99re missing out on hilarious jokes like that.\nAmy: And at the same time, not.\nSheldon: It reminds me of when my stupid brother and sister would build forts in the living room and wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t let me in. I hated that so much.\nAmy: You know, there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing I can do about getting you invited to the symposium, but if you wanted, we could build a fort.\nSheldon: Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that a little juvenile?\nAmy: More juvenile than this?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99ll get the blankets. You Google how to have childlike fun.\nScene: Mrs Wolowitz\xe2\x80\x99s house.\nHoward: You know what, I\xe2\x80\x99m being a bad host. Let me get some more coffee.\nBernadette: Oh, let me do it, Howard.\nHoward: No, I got it.\nBernadette: So, Josh, what do you do?\nJosh: I\xe2\x80\x99m studying oceanography down in San Diego.\nBernadette: Oh, how nice. I loved Finding Nemo.\nRaj: Enough chitchat. How do we know you are who you say you are?\nJosh: Why would I lie?\nRaj: Okay, you got me there. You here looking for money?\nJosh: No.\nRaj: A kidney, cornea, piece of his liver?\nJosh: No.\nRaj: You\xe2\x80\x99re in a Beatles cover band and you need Howard to replace your dad as Ringo.\nBernadette: Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you help with the coffee?\nRaj: Okay, but something smells fishy. And not just because you work around sea animals. That actually sounds interesting, and I\xe2\x80\x99d like to learn more about it. Hey, you okay?\nHoward: Not really. This guy shows up out of the blue, and now I have a brother? My father has another family?\nRaj: I get it. What do you want to do?\nHoward: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I, I\xe2\x80\x99d just like him to go away. I can\xe2\x80\x99t deal with this.\nRaj: All right, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got your back.\nHoward: Thank you. Come on. And I\xe2\x80\x99d like to point out, this wall just provided a lot of privacy.\nJosh: I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe my brother\xe2\x80\x99s an astronaut. That\xe2\x80\x99s amazing. What was it like?\nRaj: Listen, dude, it\xe2\x80\x99s time for you to hit the road.\nHoward: Hey, hey, the young man asked a good question.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nWil: So, for those of you just tuning in, we are listening to a really fun fight between my co-star\xe2\x80\xa6\nLeonard: No, no, no. We\xe2\x80\x99re not fighting, we\xe2\x80\x99re just having a conversation.\nWil: All right. We\xe2\x80\x99re listening to a really fun conversation between my co-star from Serial Ape-ist 2 and her fianc\xc3\xa9, who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t believe women should have dreams.\nLeonard: Give me back that juice.\nPenny: What is the harm if I audition?\nLeonard: Well, what if you get it?\nPenny: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, I make a movie, become rich and famous, win an Oscar, a Golden Globe and live an incredibly wonderful life.\nLeonard: From a Kevin Smith movie?\nKevin: Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m hanging up now.\nWil: Don\xe2\x80\x99t you listen to him, buddy. You\xe2\x80\x99re awesome. You\xe2\x80\x99re one of the greatest directors of our time.\nKevin: I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a part for you, Wheaton.\nWil: And that was Kevin Smith.\nPenny: Thanks a lot.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m just trying to protect you. How many times did I see you get your heart broken trying to make it as an actress?\nPenny: Okay, instead of protecting me, why don\xe2\x80\x99t you try being excited when something good happens?\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m always excited for you. I\xe2\x80\x99m excited that you found this new job where you\xe2\x80\x99re making decent money.\nPenny: Decent? I make twice what you make.\nLeonard: Wait, twice?\nPenny: Yeah.\nLeonard: Like, times two twice?\nWil: For those of you at home, Leonard just found out his fianc\xc3\xa9e makes way more money than he does. Let\xe2\x80\x99s listen.\nLeonard: I went to school for half my life. I have a doctorate. I\xe2\x80\x99m still paying off college loans.\nPenny: Well, how much do you owe? Maybe I can help you out.\nLeonard: Wil, can we just turn off the podcast for a little bit?\nWil: For those of you at home, I am shaking my head no.\nScene: The apartment. Including fort.\nAmy: How\xe2\x80\x99s it going, Sheldon?\nSheldon: Wonderful. I just finished hanging the lights.\nAmy: Can I come in?\nSheldon: Yes, oh, but enter through the side. Batman is a load-bearing blanket.\nAmy: Amazing.\nSheldon: I know. This isn\xe2\x80\x99t the printout. This is my real face.\nAmy: What are we doing? This is a fort. Let\xe2\x80\x99s sit on the floor.\nSheldon: Roughing it? Okay. Everything looks so big from down here. This must be how Leonard feels.\nScene: Mrs Wolowitz\xe2\x80\x99s house.\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m surprised you could hear me with this Thin Mint in your ear. Yeah, pretty cool, huh?\nJosh: Yeah. Anyway, I should probably get going.\nBernadette: Howie, have you noticed how often people say that when you start to do magic?\nJosh: Sorry, I have a long drive.\nHoward: Well, I hope I get to see you again.\nJosh: I hope so, too. I\xe2\x80\x99ve always dreamed of having a brother to play catch with.\nBernadette: Keep dreaming.\nHoward: Hey, I threw out the first pitch at an Angels game.\nJosh: Wow.\nBernadette: He did it with a robot.\nJosh: You had sex with a robot?\nHoward: That\xe2\x80\x99s not what she meant.\nRaj: But technically, yes.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nLeonard: Hang on, if you\xe2\x80\x99re making all this money, where is it?\nPenny: In a safe place.\nLeonard: What does that mean, under your bed?\nPenny: No, it means a diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds. I\xe2\x80\x99m not overly conservative. I\xe2\x80\x99m young, so my guy said I can afford to take some risks.\nLeonard: Wait a minute, you have a guy?\nPenny: Don\xe2\x80\x99t you have a guy?\nLeonard: Why would I have a guy? I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any money.\nPenny: Oh, sweetie, you should really get some money.\nWil: For those of you listening at home, how great is this?\nLeonard: Wil, I\xe2\x80\x99m begging you, just please turn that off.\nWil: Sure. And we\xe2\x80\x99re back.\nPenny: Leonard, why are you making such a big deal out of this? So our roles have changed a bit over the last couple years. This is the way life is. And I\xe2\x80\x99m sure in time they\xe2\x80\x99ll change again.\nLeonard: Great, you\xe2\x80\x99re not only more successful than me, now you\xe2\x80\x99re more mature.\nPenny: Okay, look, would it make you feel better if I did something dumb like sneak out of work one day to go audition for a Kevin Smith movie?\nLeonard: That would be great, thank you.\nWil: I\xe2\x80\x99m just gonna jump in here real quick. Leonard, a moment ago, you were dead set against Penny resuming her acting career, but now you\xe2\x80\x99re all for it. Is it fair to say that she played you like a violin?\nLeonard: Yes, it is, Wil.\nScene: Mrs Wolowitz\xe2\x80\x99s house.\nJosh: So, I have to ask, was the robot sexy?\nHoward: It was actually just a mechanical hand.\nJosh: \xe2\x80\x98Cause that\xe2\x80\x99s all you need, right?\nHoward: You are my brother.\nScene: The fort.\nSheldon: Okay, so the final four forts in the first annual best fort ever contest, or fort off, are, Fort Knox, Fort Ticonderoga, Fort Sumter and Fort Cozy McBlanket.\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99d say, Knox over Ticonderoga, \xe2\x80\x99cause it\xe2\x80\x99s got the gold.\nSheldon: Mm-hmm.\nAmy: And McBlanket over Sumter \xe2\x80\x99cause it has a higher thread count. Oh. Ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock. Date night\xe2\x80\x99s over.\nSheldon: Wait, no. We haven\xe2\x80\x99t picked a winner.\nAmy: We both know this one\xe2\x80\x99s gonna win.\nSheldon: Well, of course we do. Fort Knox doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have a secret physics lending library.\nAmy: Come on, I\xe2\x80\x99ll help you take this down.\nSheldon: Well, wait. What if, just this once, we suspend the date night parameters and you stay later?\nAmy: Well, as long as we\xe2\x80\x99re suspending the parameters, I could stay really late and we could have our first sleepover.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s a big step.\nAmy: It\xe2\x80\x99s a big fort.\nSheldon: Very well. I will agree to a family-friendly, G-rated, boy-girl sleepover.\nAmy: PG. Some scenes may be too intense for younger viewers.\nSheldon: G-rated, with a warning for families with babies and toddlers.\nAmy: You got yourself a sleepover.\nSheldon: Do you need to borrow a toothbrush or pajamas?\nAmy: Would it alarm you to know that I hid those things here two years ago just in case this ever came up?\nSheldon: It would, but you know how much I admire preparedness. How did you know we\xe2\x80\x99d be in the living room?\nAmy: Who says this is the only one I hid?\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: Hello? What is this?\nSheldon: We built a fort.\nLeonard: Are those my sheets?\nAmy: Yes, they are.\nLeonard: Okay. Well, you kids have fun. I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna go to sleep.\nSheldon: Well, Leonard, don\xe2\x80\x99t you want to see the inside of the fort?\nLeonard: Yeah, I\xe2\x80\x99m good.\nSheldon: Oh, come on. I really wanted to tell someone they can\xe2\x80\x99t come in.\nLeonard: Okay, fine. Sheldon, may I please visit your fort?\nSheldon: I want to say no, but it\xe2\x80\x99s too glorious. Get in here.\nLeonard: Thank you.\nAmy: Okay, have a seat on the floor.\nSheldon: Not there. That\xe2\x80\x99s my spot.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
