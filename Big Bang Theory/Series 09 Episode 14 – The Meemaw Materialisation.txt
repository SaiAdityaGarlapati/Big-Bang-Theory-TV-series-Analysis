b'Scene: The foyer.\nSheldon: Here\xe2\x80\x99s a fun Postal fact. The inner side of our mailbox is under federal jurisdiction. So, if you broke my right thumb, that\xe2\x80\x99s Pasadena city police. But if you broke my left thumb, that\xe2\x80\x99s the FBI.\nLeonard: If I\xe2\x80\x99m going to jail, I\xe2\x80\x99m killing him, not breaking his thumb.\nPenny: Yeah.\nSheldon: Oh, I got a letter from my Meemaw. Umm. Smell this.\nPenny: What is that?\nSheldon: Uh, roses, bengay, and Dr. Scholls\xe2\x80\x99 foot powder.\nPenny: Ah, yeah, Grandma by Calvin Klein. You know, the last time I got a hand written letter it was from someone who told me I parked like a blind person.\nLeonard: That someone has a name.\nSheldon: Uh, thank you. Oh, Meemaw got a new set of teeth. Oh, but then she found her old ones. Oh, so now the new ones are just gonna be her church teeth.\nLeonard: Fun. Like your Comic-Con Spock ears and your around the house Spock ears.\nPenny: I park fine.\nSheldon: Oh, my goodness, she\xe2\x80\x99s coming to visit!\nLeonard: Oh, it\xe2\x80\x99ll be nice to finally meet her.\nSheldon: Oh, you are going to love her. She is the kindest, sweetest woman you\xe2\x80\x99ll ever meet. Unless you\xe2\x80\x99re a gopher digging up her vegetable garden. In that case, you can expect to have your head bashed in with a shovel.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The airport arrivals area.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s not her. That\xe2\x80\x99s not her. That\xe2\x80\x99s not her. That\xe2\x80\x99s not her. That\xe2\x80\x99s not her. That\xe2\x80\x99s not her. That\xe2\x80\x99s not her. That\xe2\x80\x99s not her.\nLeonard: Really? The old Asian man is not your Meemaw?\nSheldon: And that\xe2\x80\x99s not helpful. You know, I got her an iPhone for Christmas. I\xe2\x80\x99ll see where she is.\nLeonard: Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s nice. Most people her age don\xe2\x80\x99t embrace technology.\nSheldon: Oh, no, she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t even know she has it. No, I had my sister slip it in her bag so that I can track her like a sea turtle.\nLeonard: Same as when we lost you at the zoo.\nSheldon: Uh, for the hundredth time, I smelled kettle corn and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t find the cart.\nLeonard: Still doesn\xe2\x80\x99t explain how you ended up on the freeway divider.\nMeemaw: Moon Pie.\nSheldon: Meemaw. I\xe2\x80\x99m so happy to see you.\nMeemaw: I\xe2\x80\x99m so happy to see you, too.\nSheldon: Oh. You got even smaller. I love it. Uh, Meemaw, this is Leonard. Leonard, this is my Meemaw.\nLeonard: Hi. So nice to finally meet you. Let me take this for you, Meemaw.\nMeemaw: Thank you.\nSheldon: No. Oh, no. Now you call her Constance. I call her Meemaw. You have your own Meemaw. It\xe2\x80\x99s not my fault she died when you were four.\nMeemaw: Is that nice to say to your friend?\nSheldon: It isn\xe2\x80\x99t, Meemaw. Sorry, Leonard.\nLeonard: Can you please live with us forever?\nScene: The comic book store.\nHoward: That\xe2\x80\x99s ridiculous. If you had a superpower, and spent your whole life being told to suppress it, when you finally decide to embrace that power, why hide in isolation?\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, and how much money did your version of Frozen make?\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m just saying, instead of Let it Go, she should really sing, Look At Me Hiding in a Freezer Like a Dove Bar.\nRaj: She built an ice castle, made a snow monster and gave herself a complete makeover in one day. You know what I saw you do today? Eat a block of cream cheese straight from the foil and lie about it to your wife.\nGirl: Sorry for eavesdropping, but did you know they actually had the song Let It Go in place before they finalized the story?\nRaj: Yeah, that\xe2\x80\x99s true. In fact, they liked the song so much, they retooled the whole script around it.\nGirl: Which is probably why that movie sucks.\nHoward: Here we are talking about Frozen, and yet, you got burned.\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99m so sorry but, how can you not like that movie?\nGirl: I just think it gets more credit than it deserves.\nHoward: Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s what I said an hour ago.\nGirl: Wow. You\xe2\x80\x99ve been talking about Frozen for an hour?\nHoward: You should\xe2\x80\x99ve seen us after The Good Dinosaur.\nRaj: It was a classic western set in the post-Jurassic period, and it changed my life.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Are you comfortable?\nMeemaw: Very. It\xe2\x80\x99s nice to rest after 800 flights of stairs.\nSheldon: You were so cute, huffin\xe2\x80\x99 and puffin\xe2\x80\x99. There\xe2\x80\x99s Amy. I just know you\xe2\x80\x99re gonna hit it off. You both have the same fashion sense. Hello. Come in, say hi to my Meemaw.\nAmy: Hi. Nice to meet you.\nMeemaw: Nice to meet you, too.\nAmy: How was your trip?\nMeemaw: Wonderful. And the pilot did such a good job, I gave him a butterscotch.\nAmy: That\xe2\x80\x99s great. And look at you, sitting in Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s spot. You know, I don\xe2\x80\x99t even get to sit there.\nSheldon: Yeah. And you never will. Ooh, hey, oh, ask her to do the tissue thing. Do it, ask her.\nAmy: Can I have a tissue?\nMeemaw: Of course.\nSheldon: Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that the best? She\xe2\x80\x99s like Grandma Spider-Man.\nMeemaw: He\xe2\x80\x99s been saying that since he was little. I still don\xe2\x80\x99t know what it means.\nSheldon: Oh, well, you two sit down and get to know each other. I\xe2\x80\x99ll get your room ready.\nMeemaw: Oh, now don\xe2\x80\x99t you go looking through my suitcase for presents.\nSheldon: If I did, would I find any?\nMeemaw: Maybe. But you also might find my brassieres and bloomers.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s a risk I\xe2\x80\x99m willing to take.\nAmy: Well, this is so nice. He\xe2\x80\x99s so excited to have you here and\xe2\x80\xa6\nMeemaw: Okay, now let\xe2\x80\x99s you and me get something straight. He may think that I came to bake him cookies, but the real reason is to size you up.\nAmy: S, s, si, size me up?\nMeemaw: Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s mother may be okay with you, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not so easy.\nAmy: Well, I, I\xe2\x80\x99m, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you\xe2\x80\x99ll like me once you get to know me.\nMeemaw: Oh, you better hope so.\nSheldon: A Texas Special cattle and calf car train set with authentic horn and bell. Thank you, Meemaw.\nMeemaw: Oh, you\xe2\x80\x99re welcome, Moon Pie.\nSheldon: Amy, why don\xe2\x80\x99t you look excited? Well, you get to watch me play with this.\nScene: The comic book store.\nRaj: Oh, I see you\xe2\x80\x99re reading Saga.\nGirl: Yeah, I hear it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty good.\nRaj: It is, and not a lot of comics have a woman with wings breastfeeding a baby right on the cover.\nGirl: I\xe2\x80\x99ll take your word for it.\nHoward: You should. He\xe2\x80\x99s really looked.\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99m Raj, by the way. This is Howard.\nHoward: Hi.\nGirl: Claire.\nRaj: Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen you here before, Claire.\nClaire: It\xe2\x80\x99s my first time. I\xe2\x80\x99m looking for inspiration for this movie I\xe2\x80\x99m writing.\nHoward: You\xe2\x80\x99re a screenwriter?\nClaire: Well, screenwriter, slash bartender, slash, a month away from living in my car.\nRaj: Yeah, I get that. I\xe2\x80\x99m a scientist, slash party planner, slash small-dog enthusiast, slash guy who probably should have stopped at scientist.\nClaire: You\xe2\x80\x99re really a scientist?\nRaj: Well, astrophysicist.\nClaire: That\xe2\x80\x99s perfect. Do you think I could pick your brain for my movie some time? It\xe2\x80\x99s animated sci-fi for kids.\nRaj: Sure. I love animated movies.\nHoward: He does, and he has the Lilo & Stitch collector plates to prove it.\nRaj: Excuse me for wanting a little magic in my life.\nClaire: Here\xe2\x80\x99s my number. Give me a call, we\xe2\x80\x99ll get together.\nRaj: Yeah, great.\nClaire: See ya.\nRaj: Yeah, bye.\nHoward: What are you doing? You have a girlfriend.\nRaj: So?\nHoward: So, how do you think she\xe2\x80\x99d feel about you helping a beautiful girl with her screenplay?\nRaj: I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say she\xe2\x80\x99s beautiful.\nHoward: Really? You don\xe2\x80\x99t think she\xe2\x80\x99s attractive?\nRaj: I do. I just wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t tell my girlfriend.\nScene: The apartment.\nPenny: Constance, are you sure I can\xe2\x80\x99t pour you some wine?\nMeemaw: Oh, no wine for me. Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s bringing me my whiskey.\nSheldon: Here you go, Meemaw. I made it just how you like, a lot in a glass.\nMeemaw: Thank you, Moon Pie.\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99m curious. Why do you call Sheldon Moon Pie?\nMeemaw: \xe2\x80\x98Cause he\xe2\x80\x99s so nummy-nummy.\nLeonard and Penny: She could just eat him up.\nSheldon: And I call her Meemaw because, well, just, well, look at her.\nMeemaw: It\xe2\x80\x99s interesting that Leonard and Penny know about his nickname and you don\xe2\x80\x99t.\nAmy: Oh, well, you know, now, now that I\xe2\x80\x99m hearing it, it does sound familiar.\nSheldon: How could it? I never told you, and you never bothered to ask.\nAmy: Well, now I know.\nSheldon: Yeah.\nMeemaw: So, Penny, I understand you have a new job.\nPenny: Yes. I\xe2\x80\x99m a pharmaceutical sales rep.\nMeemaw: Oh. It\xe2\x80\x99s so wonderful that you modern gals can have it all. A husband and a full-time career.\nAmy: I have a relationship and a full-time career, too.\nMeemaw: That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t bode well.\nAmy: Why not? You, you just said it\xe2\x80\x99s okay for her to work.\nMeemaw: Well, Leonard doesn\xe2\x80\x99t need as much tending to as Sheldon does. And as Moon Pie explained, Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s work is more of a hobby.\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99s my best friend.\nPenny: Yeah.\nAmy: Look, I, I get that you\xe2\x80\x99re protective of your grandson, but he\xe2\x80\x99s an adult now. Maybe I understand what he needs better than you do.\nMeemaw: I appreciate your honesty, dear.\nAmy: Thank you.\nMeemaw: And here\xe2\x80\x99s some more honesty. I don\xe2\x80\x99t like you very much.\nAmy: Well, maybe I don\xe2\x80\x99t like you either.\nSheldon: Well, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. You have to like each other. Well, we have a 4:30 reservation at Applebee\xe2\x80\x99s.\nAmy: I think I should leave.\nSheldon: But why? Other than you two fighting, we\xe2\x80\x99re having such a good time.\nAmy: The minute you left the room, your precious meemaw started giving me a really hard time. I don\xe2\x80\x99t need this.\nMeemaw: Let her go. And under no circumstance will you give her that engagement ring.\nAmy: What ring?\nLeonard: Maybe we should give them some privacy.\nPenny: Yeah, yeah, yeah. You go ahead. I\xe2\x80\x99ll catch up with you.\nAmy: You have an engagement ring?\nSheldon: Yes.\nAmy: Penny, did you know about this?\nPenny: All right, let\xe2\x80\x99s go.\nAmy: When did you get an engagement ring?\nSheldon: My mother gave it to me, and I had been thinking about giving it to you, but then we broke up.\nMeemaw: Well, thank goodness for that.\nAmy: Sheldon, will you please tell your grandmother to stay out of this?\nSheldon: Oh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I could do that.\nMeemaw: Sheldon, tell this girl that my ring will never be on her finger.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna opt out of that one, too.\nAmy: Who said I even want to be engaged to him? And if I do, I, I don\xe2\x80\x99t need your hand-me-downs.\nSheldon: All right, all right, look, l, let\xe2\x80\x99s all, let\xe2\x80\x99s remain calm and analyse this situation. Now, I realize that you\xe2\x80\x99ve only known each other for less than a day, but is it possible this crankiness is because your cycles have synced?\nMeemaw: You leave the room and let the grown-ups talk. Now.\nAmy: Don\xe2\x80\x99t speak to him like he\xe2\x80\x99s a child.\nSheldon: Thank you. I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna go next door and play with Leonard.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s kitchen.\nBernadette: Okay, so you met this girl, you exchanged numbers, and you\xe2\x80\x99re gonna meet up with her.\nRaj: Just to help her with her screenplay.\nBernadette: Oh. Well, I guess that\xe2\x80\x99s not so bad.\nHoward: You weren\xe2\x80\x99t there. He was really flirting.\nRaj: Hey, it\xe2\x80\x99s not my fault if American women project their fantasies on foreigners with the kind of magical voice that grants wishes.\nBernadette: I\xe2\x80\x99m sure it was harmless. People flirt. No big deal.\nHoward: Really? So it\xe2\x80\x99s okay if I fl\xe2\x80\xa6\nBernadette: Not you. I own your ass. The real question is, where are you with Emily?\nRaj: Uh, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to say. I think we\xe2\x80\x99re good, but things like this make me wonder if Emily\xe2\x80\x99s really the right person for me. I mean, did you guys ever have doubts about each other?\nHoward: No. Never.\nBernadette: Absolutely.\nHoward: What?\nBernadette: Howie, you forget how much of our early dates involved you doing magic and me doing this.\nHoward: Fine. I had reservations about you, too.\nBernadette: No, you didn\xe2\x80\x99t.\nHoward: No, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t.\nBernadette: Well, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter now, \xe2\x80\x99cause I love how things worked out.\nHoward: Me, too. And I think you\xe2\x80\x99re even more beautiful than this rose.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nPenny: Wow. You know, the last time I saw my grandma, the most exciting thing was watching the ash of her cigarette get longer and wondering if it was gonna fall in her pudding.\nLeonard: Did it?\nPenny: Yeah, right in there. She ate it and everything.\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard and Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard and Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard and Penny.\nPenny: Come in.\nLeonard: Hey. What happened? Is Amy gone?\nSheldon: No. They asked me to leave so they could speak privately.\nPenny: Uh-oh.\nSheldon: Yeah, I know. It was quite tense. So here\xe2\x80\x99s the million dollar question, uh, who wants to pop over there and get my trains?\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s kitchen.\nRaj: All right. I\xe2\x80\x99ve made up my mind. I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna do the right thing, call this girl, and let her know that I\xe2\x80\x99m in a relationship.\nHoward: Okay, so far we\xe2\x80\x99ve heard, made up my mind I\xe2\x80\x99m dumping Emily.\nBernadette: Made up my mind to date both of them by pretending to be twin brothers.\nHoward: And made up my mind, I\xe2\x80\x99ll ask for a threesome and if they say no, play it off as a joke.\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99m calling her. And the threesome didn\xe2\x80\x99t deserve the belly laugh it got.\nBernadette: You\xe2\x80\x99re right. It could totally happen.\nClaire (voice): Hello?\nRaj: Hi. Hi. Yeah, it\xe2\x80\x99s Raj. Rajesh. We met at the comic book store.\nClaire: Hey, what\xe2\x80\x99s up? Figure out what time you\xe2\x80\x99re free?\nRaj: Actually, that\xe2\x80\x99s why I\xe2\x80\x99m calling. I, um, I just, I need to let you know that I have a girlfriend.\nClaire: Okay. Good for you.\nRaj: Well, no, no. I, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to mislead you after you asked me out.\nClaire: I didn\xe2\x80\x99t ask you out. I just need help with my screenplay.\nRaj: Wait, are you saying that we didn\xe2\x80\x99t have a vibe?\nClaire: Why do you care if we have a vibe? You have a girlfriend.\nRaj: Come on, I just told you I had a girlfriend. The least you can do is tell me if we had a vibe.\nClaire: Sure, we had a vibe.\nRaj: I knew it. Okay, we did have a vibe. This is exciting. What\xe2\x80\x99s my next move?\nBernadette: You still have a girlfriend.\nRaj: Right. Good catch. Anyway, so I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry to waste your time. And, uh, and good luck with your screenplay.\nClaire: Hang on. We\xe2\x80\x99re both adults. We can still get together without it meaning anything.\nRaj: Not me. Ever since you admitted we had a vibe, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been planning our wedding.\nClaire: Look, it\xe2\x80\x99s just coffee. I\xe2\x80\x99ll ask you some questions about science, and if you propose, I promise to say no.\nRaj: Okay. That hurts a little, but okay.\nClaire: Great. I\xe2\x80\x99ll text you.\nRaj: Bye. All right. So, uh, we\xe2\x80\x99re meeting for coffee like two adults. Everybody\xe2\x80\x99s happy. Easy peasy.\nBernadette: Are you gonna tell Emily?\nRaj: Yeah, of course. We have no secrets.\nHoward: When are you gonna tell Emily?\nRaj: He lied about the cream cheese. He ate the whole thing. I saw him.\nScene: The apartment.\nAmy: Look, I know you think I\xe2\x80\x99m not right for Sheldon, but trust me, I\xe2\x80\x99m his best shot. You have no idea how much I put up with.\nMeemaw: I know more than you think I do.\nAmy: Really? You know what it\xe2\x80\x99s like to have date night ruined because Google changed their font?\nMeemaw: Young lady, if you think I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what it\xe2\x80\x99s like to live with a stubborn, egotistical man, then you\xe2\x80\x99re wrong. \xe2\x80\x98Cause that was my husband.\nAmy: Really?\nMeemaw: There were days I wanted to fill his pockets with corn and toss him in the pigpen.\nAmy: Well, if you understand, then why are you giving me such a hard time?\nMeemaw: Because when you broke up with Sheldon, it hurt him deeply, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to see that happen again.\nPenny: Hi. Sorry. Sheldon would like to say something to you.\nSheldon: No, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t.\nLeonard: Just get in here.\nSheldon: Hello.\nPenny: Go ahead.\nSheldon: Meemaw, look, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, but I have to defend my girlfriend to you.\nAmy: Oh, Sheldon, thank you.\nSheldon: Oh, great, now you\xe2\x80\x99re gonna get emotional. I always looked up to you and Pop-Pop. I, I know what a challenging man he could be, but I saw you stand by him and-and make him into a better person.\nMeemaw: I did.\nSheldon: Yeah, well, that is exactly what I\xe2\x80\x99ve been doing the last five years with this little work in progress.\nLeonard: He never disappoints, does he?\nAmy: I think what Sheldon means to say is we\xe2\x80\x99ve both grown together. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that right?\nSheldon: Well\xe2\x80\xa6\nPenny: Say yes.\nSheldon: Yes.\nMeemaw: Fine. If you feel so strongly, I won\xe2\x80\x99t stand in your way.\nSheldon: Thank you.\nAmy: So if he wanted to give me that engagement ring, we would have your blessing?\nMeemaw: I suppose.\nSheldon: I just gave you my virginity, woman. Cool your jets.\nScene: The comic book store.\nRaj: Yeah, see, if you just change the story to the destruction of our galaxy, then a super massive black hole could work.\nClaire: This is great. Thank you so much. I just got to figure out a way for everyone to die that isn\xe2\x80\x99t too scary for children.\nFantasy seqeunce.\nRaj: And that\xe2\x80\x99s how Mommy and Daddy met.\nClaire: Hey, did you ever tell Emily about us?\nRaj: I will.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
