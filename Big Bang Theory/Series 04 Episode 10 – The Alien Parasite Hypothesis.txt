b'Scene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Clarify something for me. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t the point of a communal meal the exchange of ideas and opinions? An opportunity to consider important issues of the day?\nLeonard: It is. You just kind of put a damper on things when you said, the next person I see talking with food in their mouth will be put to death.\nSheldon: Well, we could argue about who said what all night long, but to set things back on course, I will propose a new topic of conversation.\nLeonard: Great.\nSheldon: What is the best number? By the way, there\xe2\x80\x99s only one correct answer.\nRaj: Five million, three hundred eighteen thousand and eight?\nSheldon: Wrong. The best number is 73. You\xe2\x80\x99re probably wondering why.\nLeonard: No.\nHoward: Uh-uh.\nRaj: We\xe2\x80\x99re good.\nSheldon: 73 is the 21st prime number. Its mirror, 37, is the 12th, and its mirror, 21, is the product of multiplying, hang on to your hats, seven and three. Eh? Eh? Did I lie?\nLeonard: We get it. 73 is the Chuck Norris of numbers.\nSheldon: Chuck Norris wishes. In binary, 73 is a palindrome, one-zero-zero-one-zero-zero-one which backwards is one-zero-zero-one-zero-zero-one, exactly the same. All Chuck Norris backwards gets you is Sirron Kcuhc.\nRaj: Just for the record, when you enter five million three hundred eighteen thousand and eight in a calculator, upside-down it spells boobies.\nLeonard: Remember when you were wondering why the girls didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to eat with us tonight?\nHoward: Yeah, I get it now.\nScene: A bar.\nPenny: I love your little heart locket, Bernadette.\nBernadette: Oh, thanks. Howard gave it to me. It\xe2\x80\x99s the cutest thing. Every time I have dinner with his mom, the next day I get jewellery.\nAmy: Did you know that the iconic Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s heart shape is not actually based on the shape of a human heart, but rather on the shape of the buttocks of a female bending over?\nPenny: Oh, so I spent seventh grade dotting my I\xe2\x80\x99s with little asses? Cool.\nZack: Hey, Penny, how\xe2\x80\x99s it going?\nPenny: Hey, Zack, what are you doing here?\nZack: My dad\xe2\x80\x99s company prints the menus for this place. I\xe2\x80\x99m just dropping off some new ones laminated. Makes \xe2\x80\x99em easier to clean if people throw up on \xe2\x80\x99em. Guess how I got the idea?\nPenny: Yeah, I got it, I got it. Uh, Zack, these are my friends Bernadette and Amy.\nBernadette: Hi.\nZack: Hey.\nAmy: Hoo.\nZack: Okay, well, it was good to see you.\nPenny: Yeah, you, too.\nBernadette: He\xe2\x80\x99s really cute. How do you know him?\nPenny: Oh, we went out a couple of times.\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99m often flummoxed by current slang. Does went out mean had intercourse?\nBernadette: Yes.\nPenny: No, no. But in this case, yes.\nAmy: Interesting. And was it not satisfactory?\nPenny: No, it was great. He just didn\xe2\x80\x99t really challenge me on an intellectual level.\nBernadette: Couldn\xe2\x80\x99t you just fool around with him and then listen to NPR?\nPenny: Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t help. Zack can\xe2\x80\x99t even spell NPR.\nBernadette: It\xe2\x80\x99s what I do with Howard. I\xe2\x80\x99m much smarter than he is. But it\xe2\x80\x99s important to protect his manhood.\nAmy: Hoo.\nBernadette: What\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99m suddenly feeling flushed. My heart rate is elevated, my palms are clammy, my mouth is dry. In addition, I keep involuntarily saying hoo.\nPenny: Oh, we know what\xe2\x80\x99s causing that, don\xe2\x80\x99t we?\nAmy: It\xe2\x80\x99s no mystery. I obviously have the flu coupled with sudden-onset Tourette\xe2\x80\x99s syndrome.\nCredits sequence.\n  Scene: The university cafeteria.\nHoward: Did you hear about the accident at the bio lab?\nLeonard: No. What happened?\nHoward: They were injecting rats with radioactive isotopes and one of the techs got bit.\nRaj: Did he get superpowers?\nHoward: No, he got five stitches and a tetanus shot.\nRaj: Oh. Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s disappointing.\nHoward: Why?\nRaj: Well, you get bit by a radioactive animal in a lab, you kind of want to turn into a superhero.\nHoward: Yeah, but who\xe2\x80\x99d want to become Rat-Man?\nRaj: Who wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t? You could zip through a maze in nothing flat, squeeze through really small holes, and shut down restaurants in a single bound. And the best part is, if I were Rat-Man, you could be my sidekick, Mouse Boy.\nHoward: Mouse Boy?\nRaj: You don\xe2\x80\x99t like Mouse Boy? How about, uh, uh, Kid Vermin?\nHoward: First of all, if we had superpowers, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be the sidekick. You\xe2\x80\x99d be the sidekick.\nRaj: Rat-Man is nobody\xe2\x80\x99s sidekick.\nHoward: Leonard, settle this. Of the two of us, who\xe2\x80\x99s the obvious sidekick?\nRaj: Yeah, Leonard, who?\nLeonard: 12 years after high school, and I\xe2\x80\x99m still at the nerd table.\nScene: Amy\xe2\x80\x99s lab.\nSheldon: Aren\xe2\x80\x99t you slicing that man\xe2\x80\x99s brain a little too thin?\nAmy: It\xe2\x80\x99s too thin if I were making a foot-long brain sandwich at Quiznos. For examination under a two-photon microscope, it\xe2\x80\x99s fine.\nSheldon: Well, you\xe2\x80\x99re the expert. If the correct way to do it is the wrong way, then I yield.\nAmy: Very well. If you die and donate your body to science, I promise to slice your brain like Canadian bacon.\nSheldon: Thank you.\nAmy: Now, if you\xe2\x80\x99ll excuse me, I have to take my temperature.\nSheldon: Are you monitoring your circadian rhythms in order to identify your periods of maximum mental acuity? I did that one summer. Ah, youth.\nAmy: No, I experienced some distressing symptoms last night, so I\xe2\x80\x99m checking my vital signs every hour.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99d be happy to create a chart and participate in a differential diagnosis.\nAmy: Oh, that sounds like fun.\nSheldon: All right. What were the symptoms?\nAmy: Elevated heart rate, moist palms, dry mouth and localized vascular throbbing.\nSheldon: Localized to what region?\nAmy: Ears and genitalia.\nSheldon: Interesting. Not body parts that usually team up. What about environmental factors? Describe the scene for me.\nAmy: I was sitting in a restaurant with Penny and Bernadette, drinking water, carbonated as it was a special occasion. Penny\xe2\x80\x99s friend Zack stopped by and said hello and I said hoo.\nSheldon: Who?\nAmy: Zack.\nSheldon: Then why did you ask?\nAmy: Ask what?\nSheldon: Who.\nAmy: Zack.\nSheldon: All right, let\xe2\x80\x99s start over. What did you say when Zack walked in?\nAmy: Hoo.\nSheldon: Zack.\nAmy: Why do you keep saying Zack?\nSheldon: Because you keep saying who.\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99m not saying hoo now. I said hoo last night.\nSheldon: And the answer was Zack, correct?\nAmy: There was no question. I simply said hoo.\nSheldon: All right, I think I have enough to go on. Possible explanations for your symptoms are, in descending order of likelihood, hyperthyroidism, premature menopause, hosting an alien parasite or, and I only include it for the sake of covering absolutely all bases, sexual arousal.\nAmy: Where would I have picked up an alien parasite?\nScene: The cafeteria.\n  Howard: There you are.\nRaj: Oh, hey.\nHoward: Let me ask you a question. What are you most afraid of?\nRaj: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Um, nuclear war. Accidentally being buried alive. Any of those movies where you get that phone call that says you\xe2\x80\x99re going to die, and then you do.\nHoward: No. Something very specific that we both know you, Rajesh Koothrappali, are terrified of.\nRaj: Well, type two diabetes runs in my family. The thought of losing a toe\xe2\x80\xa6\nHoward: Spiders! You\xe2\x80\x99re afraid of spiders!\nRaj: What the heck is this?\nHoward: A jar with a big spider in it, of course. Bravery test. First one to take his hand out is the sidekick.\nRaj: Are you crazy?\nHoward: Perhaps. Are you scared?\nRaj: No. But it\xe2\x80\x99s a stupid test.\nHoward: Oh, really? What if the earth was in danger and the only way to save it was to stick your hand in a jar with a spider?\nRaj: Oh, yeah? What if the earth was in danger and the only way to save it was to take a shower in the locker room and let other guys see you naked?\nHoward: Oh, come on. That\xe2\x80\x99s never gonna happen. Now put your hand in the jar or forever be revealed as my sidekick.\nRaj: All right, I will.\nHoward: How did you get so brave all of a sudden?\nRaj: It\xe2\x80\x99s easy. The spider\xe2\x80\x99s crawling up your arm.\nHoward: Get it off! Get it off! Please, Raj! Ah! Ah! Ah! Please. Oh!\nScene: Amy\xe2\x80\x99s lab.\nAmy: My blood work shows thyroid function normal. Cortisol levels normal.\nSheldon: How about your follicle-stimulating hormone levels?\nAmy: Sheldon, I am not going through menopause.\nSheldon: Are you sure? You said that with the testy bark of an old biddy.\nAmy: I think we need to face the cold, hard truth, I was sexually aroused by Penny\xe2\x80\x99s friend Zack.\nSheldon: Hang on. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that we\xe2\x80\x99ve given the alien parasite hypothesis a fair shake.\nAmy: Let\xe2\x80\x99s look at this logically. I have a stomach, I get hungry. I have genitals, I have the potential for sexual arousal.\nSheldon: A cross we all must bear. You know, in difficult moments like this, I often turn to a force greater than myself.\nAmy: Religion?\nSheldon: Star Trek. Did you see Star Trek: The Motion Picture?\nAmy: No.\nSheldon: Don\xe2\x80\x99t. It\xe2\x80\x99s terrible. However, in it, we learn that when Spock finds himself drawn off the path of logic by feelings bubbling up from his human half, he suppresses them using the Vulcan mental discipline of Kolinar.\nAmy: Are you suggesting we live our lives guided by the philosophies found in cheap science fiction?\nSheldon: Cheap science fiction?\nAmy: What are you doing?\nSheldon: Using Kolinar to suppress my anger at that last comment.\nAmy: Is it possible that your concern for me at this moment is motivated by nothing more than simple jealousy?\nSheldon: I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t considered that. Give me a moment. All right, I\xe2\x80\x99ve considered it.\nAmy: And?\nSheldon: I reject it.\nAmy: You reject it because you don\xe2\x80\x99t feel jealousy, or because you are suppressing jealousy?\nSheldon: I think I\xe2\x80\x99ll eat my lunch at home.\nAmy: That\xe2\x80\x99s not your lunch, Sheldon, those are the cadaver brain specimens.\nSheldon: Oh. As they were incorrectly sliced, you can see how I could mistake them for my sashimi.\nScene: The laundry room.\nSheldon: Hello.\nPenny: Hey. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t tomorrow your usual laundry night?\nSheldon: The supermarket was out of my regular fabric softener. If this one under or over-softens, I\xe2\x80\x99ll need time to make things right.\nPenny: That\xe2\x80\x99s thinking ahead.\nSheldon: The alternative would be to think backwards. And that\xe2\x80\x99s just remembering.\nPenny: So how\xe2\x80\x99s Amy?\nSheldon: Amy\xe2\x80\x99s changed. I might have to let her go.\nPenny: Oh, no. Why?\nSheldon: I thought she was a highly evolved creature of pure intellect, like me. But recent events indicate that she may be a slave to her baser urges. Like you.\nPenny: Just going to skip over that insult.\nSheldon: What insult?\nPenny: Yeah. That\xe2\x80\x99s why I\xe2\x80\x99m going to skip over it. Are you saying that Amy is, oh, what\xe2\x80\x99s the\nscientific word?\nSheldon: Forget science. She\xe2\x80\x99s horny.\nPenny: Oh! Okay. Wow.\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s simple biology. There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing I can do about it.\nPenny: Are you sure?\nSheldon: What are you suggesting?\nPenny: I\xe2\x80\x99m suggesting there might be something you could do about Amy\xe2\x80\x99s urges?\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s illegal to spay a human being.\nPenny: Yeah. That\xe2\x80\x99s not what I had in mind.\nSheldon: Oh. Oh! You mean something I could do.\nPenny: Exactly.\nSheldon: Well, I was hoping to avoid this. But I might as well get it over with. Thank you, Penny. I\xe2\x80\x99ll let you know what happens.\nPenny: Oh, Amy, you lucky girl.\nScene: The apartment. Sheldon is on the phone.\nSheldon: Yes. This is Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Is this the Zack Johnson who used to have coitus with my neighbour Penny? Sorry to bother you. Hello. I\xe2\x80\x99m looking for a Zack Johnson who used to have coitus with my neighbour Penny. Coitus. It means intercourse. And I have a feeling I\xe2\x80\x99m speaking to the right Zack. This is Sheldon Cooper. Fine. Shelly. Yes, that does sound like a girl\xe2\x80\x99s name. No, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t bother me. Yes, Smelly Shelly does bother me. Let me tell you why I\xe2\x80\x99m calling. I\xe2\x80\x99d like to know if you\xe2\x80\x99d be interested in having sex with Amy Farrah Fowler. Amy Farrah Fowler. Yes, that is a girl\xe2\x80\x99s name. Good grief. It\xe2\x80\x99s like trying to talk to a dolphin.\nScene: A gymnasium.\nLeonard: Really? This is going to decide who\xe2\x80\x99s the hero and who\xe2\x80\x99s the sidekick?\nHoward: You got a better idea?\nLeonard: Every idea is better than this idea.\nHoward: Ding!\nRaj: Wait. What the hell is ding?\nHoward: It\xe2\x80\x99s a bell.\nRaj: I don\xe2\x80\x99t think this kind of wrestling has a bell.\nHoward: Fine. How do you want to start?\nRaj: I say, uh, how about one, two, three, go?\nHoward: One-two-three-go? That\xe2\x80\x99s for babies.\nRaj: Okay, how about, uh, on your mark, get set, go?\nHoward: That\xe2\x80\x99s for a footrace. If you want to race, we have to go outside.\nRaj: No, it\xe2\x80\x99s chilly outside. Didn\xe2\x80\x99t bring my jacket.\nHoward: Oh, for crying out loud. What kind of superhero needs a jacket?\nRaj: What kind of superhero says dibs on the red tights, dibs on the red tights.\nHoward: All right, how about this? Ready, wrestle.\nRaj: Wait. Are we starting now? Or is that what you\xe2\x80\x99re going to say when we do start, or\xe2\x80\xa6\nHoward: We\xe2\x80\x99re starting now!\nRaj: Don\xe2\x80\x99t yell at me!\nLeonard: Suppose there are worse ways to spend a Friday night. None come to mind.\nScene: A bar.\nSheldon: Look at this stamp. On what authority are they permitted to mutilate patrons as they enter?\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99m sure it\xe2\x80\x99ll wash off.\nSheldon: Little comfort tonight. I look like a Hell\xe2\x80\x99s Angel.\nAmy: There\xe2\x80\x99s Zack.\nSheldon: Are you sure this is what you want to do?\nAmy: It\xe2\x80\x99s not what I want to do, it\xe2\x80\x99s what I have to do.\nSheldon: Go, Amy Farrah Fowler. Follow your endocrine system.\nAmy: Thank you, Sheldon. You\xe2\x80\x99re a good friend.\nSheldon: Please don\xe2\x80\x99t drag this out. This is never going to come off.\nAmy: Excuse me? Zack? I am Amy Farrah Fowler. We met the other night. I have spent my life in pursuit of pure knowledge. Until I met you, my decisions were founded in logic and reason. And yet here I stand before you, 130 pounds of raging estrogen, longing to grab hold of your gluteus maximus and make Shakespeare\xe2\x80\x99s metaphorical beast with two backs.\nZack: My gluteus what?\nAmy: On the other hand, as I look at the blank, ape-like expression on your face, I have decided to adopt the Vulcan practice of Kolinar. Good-bye, Zack.\nZack: Bye. Hoo. That should hold me for a while.\nScene: The gymnasium.\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m legally obligated to inform you that I took a karate lesson when I was 11. I\xe2\x80\x99d be a regular ninja by now if my mom could\xe2\x80\x99ve arranged a carpool.\nRaj: Oh, yeah? Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been taking Pilates class at the rec center, and my abs look like sections of a Hershey bar.\nHoward: Oh, yeah? Won\xe2\x80\x99t matter, you\xe2\x80\x99re going down!\nRaj: No, uh-uh, you\xe2\x80\x99re going down!\nHoward: If anybody\xe2\x80\x99s going to go down, it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be you.\nLeonard: Fellas. It\xe2\x80\x99s been 30 minutes. Nobody\xe2\x80\x99s touched each other.\nScene: A street.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m glad you decided to reject your animal hindbrain and return to the realm of pure intellect.\nAmy: As am I. (Holds Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s hand)\nSheldon: What are you doing?\nAmy: An experiment. Nope. Nothing. Never mind.\nScene: The gymnasium.\nRaj: You realize you can\xe2\x80\x99t win.\nHoward: I prefer to think that I can\xe2\x80\x99t lose.\nRaj: You\xe2\x80\x99re wrong. It\xe2\x80\x99s only a matter of time before you fall into Rat-Man\xe2\x80\x99s rat trap.\nHoward: You pathetic fool! If there were a rat-catcher, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it catch Rat-Man?\nRaj: Just because I didn\xe2\x80\x99t express myself well doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean my underlying point was invalid! You bloviating buffoon!\nHoward: You narcissistic nincompoop!\nRaj: You crimson coward! Oh, Leonard, wake up, you\xe2\x80\x99re missing some very excellent superhero quips.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
