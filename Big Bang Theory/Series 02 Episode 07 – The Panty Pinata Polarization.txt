Yeah.\nHoward: And Kreplach.\nRaj: Hold on a second. Kreplach?\nHoward: Yeah.\nRaj: That isn\xe2\x80\x99t Klingon, it\xe2\x80\x99s Yiddish for meat-filled dumpling.\nHoward: Well, as it turns out, it\xe2\x80\x99s also a Klingon word.\nLeonard: Really? Define it.\nHoward: Kreplach, A hearty Klingon\xe2\x80\xa6 dumpling.\nRaj: Judge\xe2\x80\x99s ruling?\nSheldon: Bilurrrbe.\nPenny (entering): Hey, guys, I need to use your TV.\nSheldon: What\xe2\x80\x99s wrong with your TV?\nPenny: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, it just died, I\xe2\x80\x99m getting a bunch of static.\nHoward: Did you pay your cable bill?\nPenny: You sound just like the cable company. All right, so, shh, Tyra Banks is about to kick someone off  America\xe2\x80\x99s Next Top Model.\nSheldon: Excuse me, Penny, but we\xe2\x80\x99re\xe2\x80\xa6\nLeonard: No, no, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell her.\nSheldon: \xe2\x80\xa6playing Klingon Boggle.\nLeonard: Aw!\nHoward: What do you mean, aw? Like she didn\xe2\x80\x99t know we were nerds?\nSheldon: All right, if you must watch, then mute it with closed captions, please.\nPenny: Fine.\nSheldon: All right, Boggle warriors, kapla\xe2\x80\x99!\nHoward: Look at those women.\nLeonard: They\xe2\x80\x99re gorgeous.\nSheldon: Oh! Worf, nice! Too bad that\xe2\x80\x99s a proper noun.\nHoward: Oh, look, the\xe2\x80\x99s the future Mrs. Wolowitz. No, wait, that\xe2\x80\x99s the future Mrs. Wolowitz. With her head in the lap of, what a coincidence. It\xe2\x80\x99s the future Mrs. Wolowitz.\nLeonard: Yeah, and they can all move in with you and your mother, the current Mrs. Wolowitz.\nSheldon: Is qochbe\xe2\x80\x99 spelled with a (gargling) or a (guttural grunt)?\nHoward: Why is that Mrs. Wolowitz crying?\nPenny: Oh. That\xe2\x80\x99s Anais, none of the other girls in the house like her.\nHoward: House? What house?\nPenny: They all live in a house together.\nHoward: A house, where?\nPenny: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Somewhere in L.A.\nHoward: Wait a minute, you\xe2\x80\x99re telling me that I\xe2\x80\x99m within driving distance of a house filled with aspiring supermodels?\nPenny: Yeah, I guess.\nHoward: And they live together and shower together and have naked pillow fights?\nLeonard (to Penny who has got up to leave): Hey, wh-where are you going?\nPenny: To pay my cable bill.\nSheldon: All right, pencils down! I have lokh, makh, and cherrrkh. Anybody got those?\nCredits Sequence.\nScene: The living room. Howard and Raj are staring intently at the television. Leonard enters.\nLeonard: Did I miss anything? Did they kick Giselle off?\nRaj: Not yet, but her underwater photo shoot was an embarrassment.\nHoward: Sadly, Mrs. Giselle Wolowitz is sensitive to chlorine. Lucky for her I like my fashion models pruny and bug-eyed.\nLeonard: Sheldon, the food\xe2\x80\x99s here.\nRaj: There\xe2\x80\x99s the house, freeze frame, freeze frame.\nLeonard: What are you doing?\nRaj: Marking the star positions and physical landmarks so we can find the house of the supermodels.\nLeonard: Why?\nHoward: Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it obvious? Every week, they kick out a beautiful girl, making her feel unwanted and without self-esteem, a.k.a. the future Mrs. Howard Wolowitz.\nSheldon: Is my hamburger medium well?\nLeonard: Yes.\nSheldon: Dill slices, not sweet?\nLeonard: Yes.\nSheldon: Individual relish packets?\nLeonard: Yes.\nSheldon: Onion rings?\nLeonard: Yes.\nSheldon: Extra breading?\nLeonard: I asked.\nSheldon: What did they say?\nLeonard: No.\nSheldon: Did you protest?\nLeonard: Yes.\nSheldon: Vociferously?\nLeonard: No.\nSheldon: Well, then what took you so long?\nLeonard: Just eat.\nPenny (entering): Hey, guys, what\xe2\x80\x99d I miss? What\xe2\x80\x99d I miss?\nHoward: Giselle\xe2\x80\x99s hanging by a thread.\nPenny: Oh, good, I hate her.\nHoward: Then you\xe2\x80\x99re not invited to our wedding.\nLeonard: Here you go.\nPenny: Thank you.\nSheldon: Oh, do we have to suffer through this transparently manipulative pseudo-reality again?\nAll: Yes.\nSheldon: You and I have a standing TV schedule which is the result of extensive debate and compromise. Any alterations except for breaking news have to be pre-approved at the weekly roommate meeting.\nLeonard: Put it on the agenda.\nSheldon: But you have to make a motion to put it on agenda.\nLeonard: Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99ll make a motion, but you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to like it.\nSheldon: Fine. Mock Parliamentary procedure. At least put it on mute.\nPenny: Oh, Giselle\xe2\x80\x99s not getting kicked off. It\xe2\x80\x99s totally going to be Summer. (She picks up one of Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s onion rings. Raj lets out a high pitched squeak and points.) What?\nLeonard: Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s onion ring. Just put it back!\nPenny: It\xe2\x80\x99s one onion ring.\nHoward: Just put it back before he comes!\nLeonard: No, no, no,  no, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x99s where it was.\nHoward: Okay, here he comes, deny, deny, people, wall of silence.\nSheldon: Who touched my\xe2\x80\xa6\nAll: Penny! Penny did it.\nSheldon: Why would you do that?\nPenny: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I was hungry? What\xe2\x80\x99s the big deal?\nSheldon: The big deal is that nobody touches food on my plate.\nPenny: All right. Look, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.\nSheldon: Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, but that is your second strike.\nPenny: What?\nSheldon: You have two strikes. Three strikes and you\xe2\x80\x99re out. It\xe2\x80\x99s a sports metaphor.\nPenny: A sports metaphor?\nSheldon: Yes, baseball.\nPenny: All right, yeah, I\xe2\x80\x99ll play along. What was my first strike?\nSheldon: March 18th. You violated my rule about forwarding email humour.\nPenny: I did?\nSheldon: The photo of the cat who wants to \xe2\x80\x9chas cheezburger\xe2\x80\x9d?\nPenny: Oh, come on, everybody loves LOLcats. They\xe2\x80\x99re cute and they can\xe2\x80\x99t spell \xe2\x80\x99cause they\xe2\x80\x99re cats.\nSheldon: I trusted you with my email address, and you betrayed that trust by sending me Internet banality, strike one. Touching my food, strike two.\nLeonard: Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry. They only stay on your record for a year.\nHoward: You can get them removed early, but you have to take his class.\nPenny: Come on, I touched one onion ring.\nSheldon: And then you put it back, compromising the integrity of all the other onion rings.\nPenny: Oh, honey, the buses don\xe2\x80\x99t go where you live, do they?\nSheldon: Look, Penny, I wish I could be more lenient with you, but since you\xe2\x80\x99ve become a permanent member of our social group I have to hold you to the same standards as everybody else.\nLeonard: Congratulations. You\xe2\x80\x99re officially one of us.\nHoward: One of us, one of us.\nPenny: Well, what a thrill.\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re sitting in my spot.\nPenny: Oh, jeez, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to be kidding me.\nSheldon: Leonard, she\xe2\x80\x99s in my spot.\nLeonard: Yeah, yeah. Uh, see, here\xe2\x80\x99s the thing, after you leave, I still have to live with him.\nPenny: I don\xe2\x80\x99t care. I\xe2\x80\x99m taking a stand. Metaphorically.\nSheldon: All right, that\xe2\x80\x99s it. Strike three.\nPenny: Ooh, strike three.\nScene: The hallway, Penny exits the guys apartment.\nPenny: I\xe2\x80\x99m banished? What the hell kind of crap is that?\nLeonard: Listen, don\xe2\x80\x99t worry. I\xe2\x80\x99ll talk to him.\nPenny: Yeah, you do that.\nLeonard: Just so I know, would you be open to taking his class? You can do it online!\nScene: The Cheesecake Factory.\nHoward: So based on our triangulation we\xe2\x80\x99ve narrowed down the location of the top model house to three square miles in the Hollywood Hills.\nRaj: Or possibly Durham, North Carolina.\nHoward: When we find it, you want to go with us?\nLeonard: To do what?\nRaj: Party with the pretty girls, dude!\nLeonard: Are you insane? You\xe2\x80\x99re not going to party with them, you\xe2\x80\x99re not even going to get anywhere near that place.\nHoward: That\xe2\x80\x99s what they said to Neil Armstrong about the moon.\nSheldon: No one said anything of the kind to Neil Armstrong, the entire nation dedicated a decade of effort and treasure to put a man on the moon.\nHoward: Well, my fellow Americans, before this year is out we will put a Wolowitz on one of America\xe2\x80\x99s top models.\nRaj: And a large number of people will believe it never happened.\nPenny (arriving): Okay, let me guess. A quesadilla with soy cheese for the lactose-intolerant Leonard.\nLeonard: Thank you.\nPenny: Shrimp Caesar salad with no almonds for the highly allergic kosher-only-on-the-high-holidays Howard, and for our suddenly back on the Hindu wagon Raj, meatlover\xe2\x80\x99s pizza, no meat. Coming right up.\nSheldon: Wait. Excuse me. You forgot my barbecue bacon cheeseburger, barbecue sauce, bacon and cheese on the side.\nPenny: Oh, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t tell you? You\xe2\x80\x99re banished from the Cheesecake Factory.\nSheldon: Why?\nPenny: Well, you have three strikes. One, coming in. Two, sitting down. And three, I don\xe2\x80\x99t like your attitude.\nSheldon: You can\xe2\x80\x99t do that. Not only is it a violation of California state law, it flies directly in the face of Cheesecake Factory policy.\nPenny: Yeah, no, there\xe2\x80\x99s a new policy. No shoes, no shirt, no Sheldon.\nHoward: I bet we could sell that sign all over Pasadena.\nLeonard: Penny, can I talk to you for a minute? Hi.\nPenny: Hi.\nLeonard: Look, here\xe2\x80\x99s the thing, um, I talked to Sheldon and he feels terrible and he agrees that he was unreasonable and out of line.\nPenny: Really? Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s great.\nLeonard: Yeah, so just apologize to him, okay?\nPenny: What? I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to apologize to that nutcase.\nLeonard: Oh, come on, it\xe2\x80\x99s easy, he\xe2\x80\x99ll even tell you what to say.\nPenny: Leonard, don\xe2\x80\x99t you get it? If you guys keep going along with his insanity, you\xe2\x80\x99re just encouraging him.\nLeonard: We\xe2\x80\x99re not encouraging. It\xe2\x80\x99s more like knuckling under.\nPenny: Look, I like hanging out with you guys, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to apologize for something I didn\xe2\x80\x99t do.\nLeonard: Well, actually, technically, you did do it.\nPenny: That\xe2\x80\x99s strike one, Leonard.\nScene: The same, some minutes later.\nPenny: There you go, quesadilla, salad, there\xe2\x80\x99s your pizza, and thanks to Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s heated discussion with my manager one barbecue bacon cheeseburger, barbecue sauce, bacon and cheese on the side.\nSheldon: Thank you.\nPenny: Go ahead, eat it. I dare you\nScene: The living room. Howard on his laptop.\nHoward: That\xe2\x80\x99s it. There\xe2\x80\x99s the house, I found America\xe2\x80\x99s top models!\nRaj: Are you sure?\nHoward: Look, on the roof, Anais and Giselle are sunbathing. European-style.\nLeonard: You can recognize people on Google Earth?\nHoward: Of course not, I got a buddy of mine at NORAD to have a spy drone fly over.\nLeonard: NORAD? You\xe2\x80\x99re using military aircraft?\nHoward: It was already targeted to poke around a nuclear reactor in Siberia, I took it an hour out of its way, tops.\nPenny (entering, angry): Okay, where is he?\nLeonard: Sheldon? I just dropped him off at the comic book store. Why?\nPenny: Here. Try and go online.\nLeonard: Problem with the WiFi?\nPenny: No, just try.\nSheldon (on screen): Greetings, hamburger toucher. You are probably wondering why you cannot IM with your little friends about how much you heart various things. Well, this recorded message is alerting you that I am putting an end to your parasitic piggybacking upon our WiFi. If you want to remedy the situation you can contact the phone company, set up your own WiFi and pay for it, or you may apologize to me.\nPenny: Well?\nLeonard: I reiterate, knuckle under.\nPenny: No, no, no, no, no. It is on. I am gonna introduce your friend to a world of hurt.\nLeonard: Oh, Penny, you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get into it with Sheldon. The guy is one lab accident away from being a supervillain.\nPenny: I don\xe2\x80\x99t care, I was in junior rodeo, I can hogtie and castrate him in 60 seconds.\nHoward: No need to neuter the nerd, I can get you back online.\nLeonard: There, see? Problem solved.\nHoward: Voila!\nSheldon (voice from Howards laptop): Hello, puny insects. As a consequence of your efforts to circumvent my will, everyone is awarded one additional strike.\nLeonard: Thanks a lot, Howard.\nHoward: What are you complaining about? I\xe2\x80\x99m the one who has to take the class again.\nScene: The hallway. Sheldon is backing out of the apartment. Penny is waiting outside.\nSheldon: Oh! Hello.\nPenny: Time to do your laundry, huh?\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s Saturday night. Saturday is laundry night.\nPenny: I know. Every Saturday at 8:15, easy to anticipate.\nSheldon: What are you implying?\nPenny: I\xe2\x80\x99m implying that you\xe2\x80\x99re a creature of habit, and if something were to prevent you from doing your laundry on Saturday at 8:15, you might find it unpleasant. (Sheldon hurries away, disturbed) Knuckle under, my ass.\nScene: The laundry room. Sheldon, holding his laundry, is looking at the machines in dismay.\nPenny: Oh, no, are all the machines taken? What are you gonna do?\nSheldon: No problem, I\xe2\x80\x99ll just do my laundry another night.\nPenny: Another night? Well, I guess you can try, but deep inside your heart you\xe2\x80\x99ll know that laundry night is always Saturday night.\nSheldon: Woman, you are playing with forces beyond your ken.\nPenny: Yeah, well, your ken can kiss my Barbie.\nScene: The hallway, Penny comes storming up the stairs to the guys door.\nPenny (Knock, knock, knock): Sheldon (knock, knock, knock) Sheldon (knock, knock, knock) Sheldon.\nSheldon: Yes?\nPenny: Where are my clothes?\nSheldon: Your clothes?\nPenny: Yes, I left them in the washers and when I went down to get them, they were gone.\nSheldon: Really? Despite the sign that says \xe2\x80\x9cDo not leave laundry unattended\xe2\x80\x9d?\nPenny: Sheldon, where are my clothes?\nSheldon: You know, I do recall seeing some female undergarments. Where was that? Oh, yes, earlier this evening I happened to gaze out the window and a brassiere caught my eye. Do those look familiar?\nPenny: How the hell did you get them up on that telephone wire?\nSheldon: When you understand the laws of physics, Penny, anything is possible. And may I add, mwah-ha-ha!\nPenny: Get them down.\nSheldon: Apologize.\nPenny: Never.\nSheldon: Well, then may I suggest you get a very long stick and play panty pinata.\nPenny: Look, wait, Sheldon, this has gotten out of hand, okay? I\xe2\x80\x99ve done some stupid things, you\xe2\x80\x99ve done some stupid things, how about we just call it even and move on with our lives?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99ve done no stupid things.\nPenny: Look, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to meet me halfway here.\nSheldon: I am meeting you halfway, I\xe2\x80\x99m willing to concede that you\xe2\x80\x99ve done some stupid things.\nLeonard: Hey, you guys are talking again. Good. What happened?\nPenny: Leonard, remember when I said it was on? Well, now it\xe2\x80\x99s junior rodeo on.\nLeonard: Oh, not junior rodeo. What did you do?\nSheldon: I had no choice, Leonard, she ruined laundry night.\nLeonard (looking out of window): A-a-a-aw!\nSheldon: Mwah-ha-ha.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment. Leonard enters. Penny is taping together a number of long sticks.\nPenny: Telephone wires can\xe2\x80\x99t electrocute you, can they?\nLeonard: No. Look, this has to stop.\nPenny: Oh, no, no, no. It is just beginning.\nLeonard: All right, I really didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to do this, but\xe2\x80\xa6 here.\nPenny: What\xe2\x80\x99s this?\nLeonard: Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s Kryptonite.\nPenny: Oh, my God.\nLeonard: He can never know that I gave that to you.\nPenny: Look, I said I wanted to hurt him, but, but this?\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99ll shorten the war by five years and save millions of lives.\nScene: The living room.\nRaj: Oh, pause it. That\xe2\x80\x99s it. Confirmed. We now have the address of the top model house.\nHoward: God bless you, Google Street View registered trademark.\nLeonard: Okay, for the record what you\xe2\x80\x99re doing is really creepy.\nHoward: You know what? If it\xe2\x80\x99s creepy to use the Internet, military satellites, and robot aircraft to find a house full of gorgeous young models so that I can drop in on them unexpectedly, then fine, I\xe2\x80\x99m creepy.\nLeonard (into phone, which has just rung): Hello. Oh, hi. Yeah, hold on a second. I\xe2\x80\x99ll get him. Sheldon, it\xe2\x80\x99s for you.\nSheldon: Who is it?\nLeonard: Your mother.\nSheldon: Oh, good. Hi, Mom. How are you? But, Mom, she keeps sitting in my spot. And, and she touched my food. Okay, yes, I took her clothes, but she started it. No, that\xe2\x80\x99s not fair. Why should I have to apologize? Yeah, I really don\xe2\x80\x99t think this is the kind of thing Jesus concerns himself with. No, you\xe2\x80\x99re right, I don\xe2\x80\x99t really know what Jesus thinks about. All right, good-bye. Did you tell on me?\nLeonard: Are you kidding me? I already have two strikes.\nScene: Outside Penny\xe2\x80\x99s door.\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Penny, (knock, knock, knock) Penny, (knock, knock, knock) Penny\xe2\x80\xa6 (door opens) I am very, very sorry for what I have done. Here\xe2\x80\x99s your laundry, I rescind your strikes and you are no longer banished.\nPenny: Can I sit wherever I want? No, no, never mind, never mind, that\xe2\x80\x99s, that\xe2\x80\x99s not important. Sheldon, this was big of you. Thank you. I really appreciate it.\nSheldon: Thank you.\nPenny: Good night, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Penny.\nPenny: Yes?\nSheldon: Well played.\nPenny: Thank you.\nSheldon: Just remember: with great power comes great responsibility.\nPenny: Understood.\nScene: The top model house. The doorbell rings. One of the models answers. Howard and Raj are outside wearing blue jumpsuits.\nModel: Can I help you\nHoward: Yes, we here to fix the cable.\nModel: I think we have satellite.\nHoward: That\xe2\x80\x99s what I meant.\nModel: Oh. Okay, come on in.\nHoward: She\xe2\x80\x99s taller than all the women in my family combined.\nRaj: What do we do now?\nHoward: Follow Mrs. Wolowitz.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
