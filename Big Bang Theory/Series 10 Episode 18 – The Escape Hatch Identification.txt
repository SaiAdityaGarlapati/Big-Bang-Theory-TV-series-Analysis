b'Scene: The apartment.\nLeonard: Aw, man, did you see this post from Raj?\nPenny: What? Is it another video of him and his dog Lady-and-the-Tramping some spaghetti?\nLeonard: No. He can\xe2\x80\x99t afford his apartment, and he\xe2\x80\x99s asking if anyone knows of a cheap place to live. I want to say India, but it seems mean.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom.\nBernadette: What\xe2\x80\x99s so funny?\nHoward: Raj is looking for a cheap place to live, and I wrote India.\nBernadette: Don\xe2\x80\x99t post that, be supportive.\nHoward: Maybe you should be supportive of my hilarious jokes. Fine, what should we do?\nBernadette: We\xe2\x80\x99re smart. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure we can think of something.\nHoward: You want to let him live here?\nBernadette: Oh, we\xe2\x80\x99re smarter than that.\nScene: Sheldon and Amy\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom.\nSheldon: I know our apartment\xe2\x80\x99s small, but I think we can make room.\nAmy: No, Sheldon. We are not getting a life-size Spider-Man statue.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: We do have Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s old room. If he really needs a place to stay, I guess we should offer it to him.\nPenny: You\xe2\x80\x99re a good friend.\nLeonard: Am I still a good friend if I wait and hope that Howard offers him a place to live first?\nPenny: You\xe2\x80\x99re an even better husband.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom.\nHoward: I know if the roles were reversed, he would do it for me.\nBernadette: Where would he stay? We already have Stuart.\nHoward: Well, we can make some space in the garage. Maybe put a cot out there, get him a space heater, maybe a hot plate.\nBernadette: That sounds awful.\nHoward: Let\xe2\x80\x99s hope he thinks so, too.\nScene: Sheldon and Amy\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom.\nAmy: For the last time, no Hulk, no Batman, no life-size statues.\nSheldon: Wow. I\xe2\x80\x99m starting to think you didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean it when you said you wanted to spruce up the place.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: Raj\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nRaj (answering phone): Hello.\nHoward: Hey, uh, so we\xe2\x80\x99ve been talking, and if you need a place to stay, we\xe2\x80\x99d be happy to fix up the garage for you.\nRaj: That would be amazing. I was literally just looking at my moving boxes, trying to pick one to live in.\nHoward: I know it\xe2\x80\x99s not ideal, but you\xe2\x80\x99d have plenty of space for your furniture, and there\xe2\x80\x99s this cool button that makes an entire wall go up and down.\nRaj: I cannot thank you enough.\nHoward: It is our pleasure. (beep, beep, beep) Hey, can you hold on one sec? Hello?\nLeonard: Hey, buddy, you still looking for a place to live?\nRaj: Uh, yeah. Why do you ask?\nLeonard: You know, we have the extra bedroom, and if you need it, it\xe2\x80\x99s yours.\nRaj: Oh, my God, that\xe2\x80\x99s so generous.\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s the least we can do.\nRaj: I really appreciate it. Uh, can you hold on one second? Hey, so, Howard, what\xe2\x80\x99s the bathroom situation gonna be?\nHoward: Well, there\xe2\x80\x99s a sink out there, that takes care of half your problems.\nRaj: But I can use the downstairs bathroom, right?\nHoward: Yeah. We barely use it, so it\xe2\x80\x99ll be like it\xe2\x80\x99s yours.\nRaj: Cool, cool, yeah, yeah, hold on one second.\nHoward: What?\nRaj: Hey, what\xe2\x80\x99s it like sharing a bathroom with Penny? Is there hair everywhere? Does she use your loofah?\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a loofah.\nRaj: Okay, well, if I move in, you can\xe2\x80\x99t use mine. Hold on a second. Hey, Howard, uh, how\xe2\x80\x99s the Wi-Fi in the garage?\nHoward: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Why are you asking all these questions?\nRaj: Well, to be honest, Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s on the other line, and he offered me their spare bedroom.\nHoward: Great. Go live there.\nRaj: But you made the garage sound so fun.\nHoward: I just didn\xe2\x80\x99t want you to feel bad about it. Unless Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s apartment also has a raccoon that chews its way in on cold nights, go there.\nRaj: One second. Okay, I think we\xe2\x80\x99re close. How do you feel about a mini-fridge in my room?\nPenny: Hey, pal, you want to live here or not?\nRaj: Oh, uh, hi, Penny. Yes, please.\nScene: The lobby.\nLeonard: Hey.\nAmy: Hi.\nSheldon: Hi, uh, Penny, this circular is addressed to occupant, but with our apartment switch, it\xe2\x80\x99s unclear whether it\xe2\x80\x99s yours or mine.\nPenny: What\xe2\x80\x99s it for?\nSheldon: Roofing.\nPenny: Yeah, it\xe2\x80\x99s yours.\nSheldon: Okay, thanks. Just throw it out. Speaking of occupants, I\xe2\x80\x99m given to understand Raj will be moving into my old room.\nLeonard: Yeah, for a little while.\nSheldon: What about his dog?\nPenny: She\xe2\x80\x99ll be in her crate, it\xe2\x80\x99s not a big deal.\nSheldon: I suppose that\xe2\x80\x99s acceptable.\nAmy: Well, Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s getting a little better with dogs. He even took a picture with Pluto at Disneyland.\nSheldon: If real dogs gave me buttons, I\xe2\x80\x99d like them, too. Well, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s very nice that you\xe2\x80\x99re helping out our friend.\nLeonard: And I think it\xe2\x80\x99s nice that you\xe2\x80\x99re taking whatever medication Amy\xe2\x80\x99s clearly giving you.\nSheldon: And what is that supposed to mean?\nPenny: Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s like that science thing. For every action, you have a gigantic and annoying reaction.\nLeonard: Just when I thought you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get any hotter.\nPenny: Mm-hmm.\nSheldon: If you\xe2\x80\x99re implying that I\xe2\x80\x99d have some problem with him moving into my room, you\xe2\x80\x99re wrong. Raj is in a difficult financial situation, and I\xe2\x80\x99m glad that he\xe2\x80\x99s making changes to improve it.\nLeonard: Do not adjust the dosage. You nailed it.\nAmy: Don\xe2\x80\x99t listen to them. What\xe2\x80\x99s weird is that Penny almost got a science fact right.\nSheldon: I mean, it\xe2\x80\x99s unfair; people just assume I\xe2\x80\x99m going to be upset by Raj moving into my old room.\nAmy: But you are, aren\xe2\x80\x99t you?\nSheldon: Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m outraged.\nAmy: Talk to me. Tell me what\xe2\x80\x99s going on.\nSheldon: Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s been my room since before I met Leonard, and now someone else is going to be living in it. And that someone else is not me. And you know how I feel about people who aren\xe2\x80\x99t me.\nAmy: There are a lot of memories wrapped up in that room. For me, too. The first time you told me you loved me was in that room.\nSheldon: Wrong. We were standing outside my room in the hallway.\nAmy: And there is the love of which I speak.\nSheldon: I realize it\xe2\x80\x99s irrational, but with Raj moving in there, I\xe2\x80\x99m feeling a bit replaced.\nAmy: Well, this isn\xe2\x80\x99t an easy time for him. He\xe2\x80\x99s losing his apartment, he\xe2\x80\x99s in debt, he\xe2\x80\x99s probably humiliated.\nSheldon: Yes, probably. But until we know for sure, how can I feel better?\nScene: The apartment.\nRaj: Can I get anyone anything at all?\nPenny: Raj, you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to serve us.\nRaj: It\xe2\x80\x99s the least I can do for helping me carry my stuff up.\nHoward: It was really no problem.\nBernadette: Not for you, box of towels.\nRaj: Anyway, thanks again.\nHoward: Hey, look at that. You\xe2\x80\x99ve got a Raj, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a Stuart. Maybe we should take them both to the park and let them run around together.\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Yours looks like he has worms.\nScene: Sheldon and Amy\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nAmy: You ready to go?\nSheldon: All set.\nAmy: What\xe2\x80\x99s that?\nSheldon: A housewarming gift for Raj.\nAmy: Well, a bunch of fake snakes better not spring out of it, \xe2\x80\x99cause that was a lousy anniversary present.\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s nothing like that. I just, I thought about Raj\xe2\x80\x99s situation, and I had a change of heart. You know, and regarding your gift, you said surprise me, and, boy, did I. Hello.\nLeonard: Hey.\nPenny: Hi.\nLeonard: Perfect timing. Food\xe2\x80\x99s ready.\nSheldon: Uh, wait, before we eat, I have a little welcome to the building gift for Raj.\nPenny: Wait, is anything gonna jump out of that.\nAmy: No. I already asked.\nRaj: Thank you, Sheldon. It\xe2\x80\x99s a blank notebook.\nSheldon: Well, I had some of my best ideas in that room, and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you will, too.\nHoward: He also never had sex in that room. That\xe2\x80\x99s something else to look forward to.\nRaj: This means a lot.\nSheldon: Well, I know this is a difficult time for you. You\xe2\x80\x99re losing your apartment, you\xe2\x80\x99re in debt, and you just, you must be humiliated.\nAmy: Sheldon.\nSheldon: Oh, good grief. She is such a stickler for citing sources. Those were Amy\xe2\x80\x99s words.\nAmy: Sheldon.\nSheldon: I know, I know, good grief was originally said by Charlie Brown, geez.\nRaj: You\xe2\x80\x99re right, I am humiliated. Thanks for pointing it out. You\xe2\x80\x99re such a jerk.\nSheldon: Can you believe this guy?\nEveryone: Yes.\nSheldon: I thought that was gonna break the other way.\nAmy: Come on, Sheldon. Maybe we should just eat at our place.\nSheldon: Fine. You took my room. You turned my friends against me. I hope you\xe2\x80\x99re happy.\nRaj: What do I have to be happy about? My life\xe2\x80\x99s a wreck.\nSheldon: How come he can say it and I can\xe2\x80\x99t?\nAmy: Just keep walking.\nScene: Sheldon and Amy\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nBeverley (on skype): Hello, Sheldon. What a pleasant surprise. How are you?\nSheldon: Honestly, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been better. Do you have time? Leonard says you\xe2\x80\x99re very busy these days.\nBeverley: Oh, I just say that because he prattles. What\xe2\x80\x99s going on?\nSheldon: Well, our friend Raj moved into my old room, and it\xe2\x80\x99s brought up a lot of negative feelings for me.\nBeverley: Mm. Well, what do you think the loss of your room represents?\nSheldon: Beverley, you know I hold you in high esteem. Can we skip the part where you pretend not to know the answer, and get to the part where you tell me the answer?\nBeverley: Very well, but, uh, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind, I\xe2\x80\x99d still like to pause for effect. Now, you\xe2\x80\x99ve recently moved in with Dr. Fowler, yes?\nSheldon: I have.\nBeverley: Clearly, your old room represents an escape hatch, and without it, you\xe2\x80\x99re forced to confront the terrifying reality of being trapped in a relationship with Amy forever.\nSheldon: I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t thought about that.\nAmy: And don\xe2\x80\x99t start thinking about it now.\nBeverley: Hello, Amy. Your defensiveness may indicate similar insecurities about your relationship with Sheldon.\nAmy: That\xe2\x80\x99s not true.\nBeverley: She said defensively.\nAmy: This isn\xe2\x80\x99t about me and Sheldon. This is about Rajesh moving in with Leonard and Penny.\nBeverley: Interesting. They\xe2\x80\x99ve found a need to take yet another room mate. Seems they\xe2\x80\x99re avoiding some harsh realities themselves.\nSheldon: I had no idea all our relationships were such a disaster. Boy, you\xe2\x80\x99re good.\nBeverley: That is the word on the street, dear.\nScene: The apartment.\nRaj: Maybe moving in was a bad idea. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t been here one day, I\xe2\x80\x99m already causing problems.\nPenny: You didn\xe2\x80\x99t do anything. It\xe2\x80\x99s Sheldon.\nLeonard: You didn\xe2\x80\x99t do anything, it\xe2\x80\x99s Sheldon. That\xe2\x80\x99d make a nice needlepoint pillow.\nPenny: So, relax. We\xe2\x80\x99re happy to have you.\nRaj: Thank you, but how do I know you\xe2\x80\x99re not saying that just to be nice?\nPenny: Do you actually pay for that haircut?\nRaj: That\xe2\x80\x99ll do it.\nSheldon: Hey, Raj, I owe you an apology. Look, could you please put your dog on a leash?\nRaj: Sheldon, she\xe2\x80\x99s fine.\nSheldon: Well, then at least hold her still so I can pretend she\xe2\x80\x99s stuffed. Raj, I let my emotions get the best of me, and I unfairly took it out on you.\nRaj: Thank you. I appreciate that.\nSheldon: No, I can\xe2\x80\x99t take all the credit. I spoke with Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s mother, and she made me feel better.\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know who you talked to, but that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t my mother.\nSheldon: Beverly pointed out that I\xe2\x80\x99m experiencing insecurities in my relationship with Amy, in the same way that Leonard and Penny are in their relationship.\nPenny: What are you talking about? We\xe2\x80\x99re fine.\nSheldon: Yes, you\xe2\x80\x99re fine as long as you have a buffer living with you to distract from your marital problems. It used to be me. Now it\xe2\x80\x99s Raj and his attack Tribble. Anyway, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry for everything. Oh, and FYI, if you cry while they\xe2\x80\x99re fighting, they\xe2\x80\x99ll take you to McDonald\xe2\x80\x99s.\nScene: The apartment.\nBeverley (on skype): Hello, Leonard.\nLeonard: Why are you saying we have marital problems? We don\xe2\x80\x99t have marital problems.\nBeverley: I see. You must be yelling at me out of wedded bliss.\nLeonard: Look, just because we took our friend in does not mean that Penny and I are afraid to be alone.\nPenny: Yeah, this is a special circumstance.\nBeverley: Sheldon mentioned you tried to get your brother to live with you, as well.\nPenny: Yeah, well, a circumstance can happen twice and still be special.\nBeverley: Do you agree with that?\nLeonard: Well, now that you point it out\xe2\x80\xa6\nPenny: Are you kidding me?\nLeonard: We do seem to keep finding room mates.\nPenny: Now you\xe2\x80\x99re taking her side?\nBeverley: Dear, I would never come between you and Leonard. That\xe2\x80\x99s for your parade of room mates to do.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom.\nRaj: Howard? Howard? It\xe2\x80\x99s me, it\xe2\x80\x99s just me.\nHoward: What are you doing here?\nRaj: Well, I texted you, but you didn\xe2\x80\x99t respond. Leonard and Penny were arguing.\nStuart: Not on my watch.\nBernadette: It\xe2\x80\x99s fine. It\xe2\x80\x99s just Raj. You can hit him with the bat, but it\xe2\x80\x99s fine.\nStuart: And if my heart stops, just let me go.\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, guys. Sheldon was upset, Leonard and Penny were fighting, I just wanted to go some place where I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t causing problems.\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99ll say it again. India.\nRaj: Can I just stay in the garage?\nBernadette: Don\xe2\x80\x99t do that. We\xe2\x80\x99ll make up the couch for you and figure out something in the morning.\nRaj: Thank you.\nStuart: Come on, I\xe2\x80\x99ll get you some sheets. Then I\xe2\x80\x99ll see if I can beat my high score on the blood pressure machine.\nHoward: Never should\xe2\x80\x99ve had all these kids so close together.\nScene: Sheldon and Amy\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom.\nAmy: You okay?\nSheldon: I can\xe2\x80\x99t sleep.\nAmy: What\xe2\x80\x99s wrong?\nSheldon: Beverley believes I unconsciously consider my old room an escape hatch.\nAmy: Is that bothering you?\nSheldon: Yes. I don\xe2\x80\x99t care for unconscious thoughts. My brain and I are best friends. It should tell me everything.\nAmy: I mean, how it relates to our relationship, not the bromance between you and your brain.\nSheldon: What if she\xe2\x80\x99s correct? Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t that say something troubling about us?\nAmy: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I just think you\xe2\x80\x99re the kind of person who likes a contingency plan.\nSheldon: That is true. Did you know I figured out in which order I would eat all my friends in the event of an apocalypse?\nAmy: You need to stop hanging out with your brain so much. It\xe2\x80\x99s not a good influence.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s living room.\nStuart: If you\xe2\x80\x99re looking for spare change, I already cleaned it out.\nRaj: Well, didn\xe2\x80\x99t think this is where my life would be.\nStuart: Me, either. I\xe2\x80\x99m in a bedroom and you\xe2\x80\x99re on a couch. I\xe2\x80\x99m actually winning.\nRaj: You know, we\xe2\x80\x99re both down on our luck. Maybe you and I should try to get a place together.\nStuart: Okay, listen to me. There is no reason to leave here. This is great. Everyone\xe2\x80\x99s nice. It\xe2\x80\x99s comfortable. If all goes according to plan, this is my retirement home.\nRaj: Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you feel better about yourself if you were more independent?\nStuart: Better than I feel in their steam shower? I don\xe2\x80\x99t think so.\nScene: Sheldon and Amy\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom.\nSheldon: Penny would be the entree. Then Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s basically a cheese course. And because I love you, you\xe2\x80\x99re dessert.\nAmy: I want to say aw, but I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna say ew.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s living room.\nRaj: No, you see, I\xe2\x80\x99m doing this so I can stop being spoiled and, you know, grow as a person.\nStuart: Good for you. This sandwich has six dollars worth of ham in it.\nRaj: Don\xe2\x80\x99t you even feel a little bad sponging off your friends?\nStuart: Hey, look, I went to art college, I tried to make it as a graphic artist, a comic book artist, and you know what I got for my efforts? A visible rib cage. I\xe2\x80\x99m not kidding. You could see my heart beating.\nRaj: Well, no offence, but I didn\xe2\x80\x99t go to art school. I have a PhD in astrophysics.\nStuart: Oh, great, it\xe2\x80\x99ll be easier for you to look up at the stars without a roof over your head.\nScene: The apartment.\nPenny: Morning.\nLeonard: Did you know Raj moved out last night?\nPenny: What? Why?\nLeonard: Leonard and Penny, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry for all the trouble I\xe2\x80\x99ve caused. I went to stay at Howard\xe2\x80\x99s. PS Cinnamon\xe2\x80\x99s with me, but if you feel like messing with Sheldon, tell him she\xe2\x80\x99s loose in the building.\nPenny: I feel terrible.\nLeonard: Should we go bring him back?\nPenny: Well, you\xe2\x80\x99re the one worried having someone live with us is a sign of problems.\nLeonard: Oh, that was just because my mother got in my head. It\xe2\x80\x99s like being possessed, but instead of Satan it\xe2\x80\x99s, actually, it\xe2\x80\x99s the same thing.\nPenny: All right, so we\xe2\x80\x99ll ask him to come back.\nLeonard: Well, great.\nPenny: Don\xe2\x80\x99t you want to get dressed first?\nLeonard: Just one second. Help, Cinnamon\xe2\x80\x99s loose in the building.\nSheldon (off): Amy, quick, lock the door.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s living room.\nPenny: We\xe2\x80\x99re so sorry if we made you feel uncomfortable. We really weren\xe2\x80\x99t fighting about you.\nRaj: I just never want to be a burden on my friends.\nStuart: Me, either. Don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be a burden. Hey, is that the baby? I\xe2\x80\x99ll go check.\nLeonard: You are not a burden, and we want you to come back and stay with us.\nRaj: But I also upset Sheldon, and he\xe2\x80\x99s not gonna want to come over if I\xe2\x80\x99m there.\nPenny: More reasons for you to stay.\nStuart: Halley\xe2\x80\x99s fine.\nBernadette: You know she\xe2\x80\x99s at my parents\xe2\x80\x99 house, right?\nStuart: And she\xe2\x80\x99s having the time of her life.\nHoward: If you ever want to change things up, you\xe2\x80\x99re always welcome here.\nBernadette: Just not in our bedroom, you dumbass.\nRaj: I appreciate it, but I think staying with Leonard and Penny makes more sense for everyone.\nPenny: Then it\xe2\x80\x99s settled.\nRaj: And just so you know, it\xe2\x80\x99s only temporary. I\xe2\x80\x99m not gonna get too comfortable.\nBernadette: Good. Nobody needs a mooch living in their house forever.\nStuart: Hey, that\xe2\x80\x99s no way to talk about your baby.\nScene: Sheldon and Amy\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nSheldon: You know what? I\xe2\x80\x99m proud of us. Yeah, with Penny and Leonard taking in Raj, and Stuart living with Howard and Bernadette, we\xe2\x80\x99re the only couple of our social group who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t need to fill the holes in their relationship with a third party.\nAmy: Yup, we\xe2\x80\x99re killin\xe2\x80\x99 it.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
