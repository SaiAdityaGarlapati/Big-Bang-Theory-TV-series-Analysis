b'Scene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Oh, dear. Penny, have you been recording shows on our DVR again?\nPenny: No.\nSheldon: Answer honestly. This is not a trial. That\xe2\x80\x99ll come later.\nPenny: Absolutely not. Help me out here, I can\xe2\x80\x99t afford another demerit.\nLeonard: Yeah. Uh, maybe we were hacked. You know, the Chinese have been hacking everything lately.\nSheldon: Why would the Chinese make our DVR record Paul Blart: Mall Cop?\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. It\xe2\x80\x99s a fat guy on a Segway. That\xe2\x80\x99s funny everywhere.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m deleting it.\nPenny: Well, hang on. Maybe the Chinese haven\xe2\x80\x99t finished watching it yet.\nLeonard: You know, if you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to make space on the DVR, why don\xe2\x80\x99t you just get rid of some of the stuff you\xe2\x80\x99ve already watched? Like, um, Alphas.\nSheldon: No, that\xe2\x80\x99s the season two finale. That was quite the cliffhanger. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to re-watch it before season three starts.\nLeonard: There is no season three. They cancelled that show.\nSheldon: Well, they can\xe2\x80\x99t cancel it. It ended on a cliffhanger.\nLeonard: They did.\nPenny: Uh, Sheldon, there are two dumplings left. Do you want them?\nSheldon: Dumplings? Don\xe2\x80\x99t you understand what\xe2\x80\x99s going on here?\nPenny: As a rule, no.\nSheldon: That show ended with all the residents of New York either dead or unconscious. Oh, now I\xe2\x80\x99ll never know what happened.\nPenny: Well, why don\xe2\x80\x99t you make up your own ending?\nSheldon: Oh, sure, what a wonderful idea. And after that, I\xe2\x80\x99ll make up my own rules of oral hygiene. You know, instead of flossing, I\xe2\x80\x99ll rub pudding on my gums. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to get the number of the SyFy Channel and give them what for.\nLeonard: Oh, please, don\xe2\x80\x99t do that.\nSheldon: No. They can\xe2\x80\x99t just cancel a show like Alphas. You know? They have to help the viewers let go. Firefly did a movie to wrap things up. Buffy the Vampire Slayer continued on as a comic book. Heroes gradually lowered the quality season by season till we were grateful it ended.\nPenny: I feel bad for whoever gets that phone call.\nLeonard: Ah, don\xe2\x80\x99t. If they didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to be yelled at by crazy nerds, they shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have started a sci-fi channel.\nCredits sequence\nScene: Raj\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nHoward: I think you\xe2\x80\x99re gonna be really happy with this security camera. The optics are great, it\xe2\x80\x99s got infrared technology, and there\xe2\x80\x99s even a backup battery when the power goes out.\nRaj: Whatever. I can see my little princess while I\xe2\x80\x99m at work, right?\nHoward: Why can\xe2\x80\x99t you just watch porn like a regular guy? I need your laptop so I can configure the software.\nRaj: Wait, hold on. This is weird.\nHoward: What?\nRaj: I was Googling that girl I\xe2\x80\x99ve been dating, and I found her blog.\nHoward: Cool. Anything juicy?\nRaj: She said she recently went on a date with a guy named Roger? And he\xe2\x80\x99s Indian? And he\xe2\x80\x99s an astrophysicist, too?\nHoward: You know what\xe2\x80\x99s going on, don\xe2\x80\x99t you?\nRaj: Yes, Mummy was right. American girls are sexually voracious devils.\nHoward: I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe I have to explain this. People change names on blogs to protect their privacy. Roger is Raj.\nRaj: Oh. I always thought, if I had a white name, it would be Gavin.\nHoward: Keep reading. What does it say?\nRaj: No, no, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if I should. If she wanted me to know about her blog, she would\xe2\x80\x99ve told me. It\xe2\x80\x99s almost like I\xe2\x80\x99m reading her diary.\nHoward: It\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what it\xe2\x80\x99s like. Keep reading.\nRaj: No, this is creepy.\nHoward: Oh, I think we were looking at creepy in the rearview mirror when I put up that camera.\nRaj: It\xe2\x80\x99s not creepy. Don\xe2\x80\x99t listen to him. Oh, look who\xe2\x80\x99s got the sweetest kisses.\nHoward: Should I go?\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nLeonard: With all the TV Sheldon was talking about, I had the greatest idea ever. It even blows away my idea for a Star Wars themed coffee shop called Brewbacca\xe2\x80\x99s. You need to watch Buffy the Vampire Slayer. It is the perfect show for the two of us. It\xe2\x80\x99s got action and jokes and hot vampires and romance. I cannot oversell this. What do you say?\nPenny: It\xe2\x80\x99s six thirty in the morning.\nLeonard: I thought you grew up on a farm.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon (on phone): Hello, SyFy Network? Yeah, this is your vice president of programming. Now, we have made a horrible mistake regarding Alphas. Yeah, we need to uncancel it immediately. Well, you just put me through to the people who handle that, you tell them it\xe2\x80\x99s me, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to answer a lot of questions about if I really am who I say I am, you know? I just. I want this done. No, I am not the person who just called. That man was clearly a cowboy. Yeah, who was plumb concerned about y\xe2\x80\x99all cancelling his favourite show. Why do they keep hanging up on me?\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry you\xe2\x80\x99re upset. You know, Sheldon, sometimes people seek the comfort of physical contact in moments like this.\nSheldon: I am not flying back to Texas just so my mom can give me a hug.\nAmy: Okay. Well, what I think is going on here is you have a pathological need for closure.\nSheldon: Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s nonsense. I mean, you tell me stories about your day all the time. I don\xe2\x80\x99t care how they end.\nAmy: You know, I might be able to help you with this. There\xe2\x80\x99s a whole field of behavioural neuroscience that examines ways to retrain your neural pathways so stuff like this bothers you less.\nSheldon: Yeah, but I just told you, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a problem with closure.\nAmy: You sure about that?\nSheldon: Oh, quite sure. (Amy starts a knocking sequence on the table. After staring at her a moment, Sheldon completes it.) That proves nothing.\nScene: Raj\xe2\x80\x99s office.\nHoward: Ready to go to lunch?\nRaj: Do you think I\xe2\x80\x99m feminine?\nHoward: Yeah. Let\xe2\x80\x99s go.\nRaj: Thanks a lot.\nHoward: What\xe2\x80\x99s going on?\nRaj: I broke down, and I read Lucy\xe2\x80\x99s blog, and in one of the entries she said, when we first met, I struck her as a little feminine.\nHoward: Just a little? That\xe2\x80\x99s great.\nRaj: I have to talk to her about this.\nHoward: Oh, geez, why do you girls always want to talk about things? Listen to me, if she\xe2\x80\x99s writing about your relationship, use it to your advantage. Rig the game.\nRaj: Well, that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem fair.\nHoward: Is it fair that girls like confident, normal guys more than nervous weirdos?\nRaj: No, it\xe2\x80\x99s not. I\xe2\x80\x99ve always thought that was unfair.\nHoward: So take what\xe2\x80\x99s in that blog and use it to get her pants off.\nRaj: Why do you have to make everything so filthy? Why couldn\xe2\x80\x99t you just say the blog is like her giving me the key to her heart?\nHoward: The key to her heart. That\xe2\x80\x99s nice. Were you quoting someone or is it tattooed on the small of your back?\nRaj: I was quoting a man who knows a thing or two about women, Sir Elton John.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nLeonard: So, did you love it? Of course you loved it. How could you not love it? Tell me how much you loved it.\nPenny: It was cute.\nLeonard: Oh, don\xe2\x80\x99t say cute. That\xe2\x80\x99s the worst.\nPenny: What\xe2\x80\x99s wrong with cute?\nLeonard: It just makes things seem small. It diminishes them.\nPenny: So you want me to stop calling your little tushy cute?\nLeonard: You can try, but nobody\xe2\x80\x99s gonna believe you. I just, I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand how you can watch a show that great and not be excited by it.\nPenny: I liked it. I\xe2\x80\x99m excited.\nLeonard: Well, then, tell your face.\nPenny: What do you want from me?\nLeonard: You know what? Never mind. We gave it a shot. Let\xe2\x80\x99s just see what else is on.\nPenny: Oh, come on, don\xe2\x80\x99t be like that.\nLeonard: Well\xe2\x80\xa6\nPenny: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry I called it cute. Let\xe2\x80\x99s watch another one.\nLeonard: Really?\nPenny: Yeah, it was fun. Kind of reminded me of my high school. But instead of vampires, we had meth heads. But both came out at night and had messed up teeth.\nLeonard: All right, cool. I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll like the next one better. All the cheerleaders are suffering from an evil curse.\nPenny: Oh. Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s like my high school, too. But instead of a curse, it was crabs.\nScene: The apartment.\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99ve come up with a series of exercises to help with your compulsive need for closure.\nSheldon: I take issue with the word compulsive.\nAmy: All I\xe2\x80\x99m saying is, we live in a world where closure isn\xe2\x80\x99t always an op\xe2\x80\xa6\nSheldon: \xe2\x80\xa6tion. Okay. For the sake of argument, let\xe2\x80\x99s say I have a problem. What would be your plan for addressing it?\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99m going to recondition your brain so that the need for completion isn\xe2\x80\x99t so overwhelming.\nSheldon: By playing tic-tac-toe?\nAmy: Yep. Your turn.\nSheldon: Oh, Amy. And you wonder why people think neuroscience is nothing but a goofy game for diaper babies. Tic-tac-toe can only end in win, lose or draw, none of which will deny me closure. Especially since I\xe2\x80\x99m about to win. (She wipes the board clean.) B-But we didn\xe2\x80\x99t finish.\nAmy: Exactly. How does that make you feel?\nSheldon: The same way any normal person would. I feel like I want to peel off my own face and tear it in two and then again and again until I have a handful of Sheldon-face confetti.\nAmy: And that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly the feeling we want to address with this course of treatment.\nSheldon: Or you could pitch in, grab a nostril and help me get this face off.\nAmy: Come on, you can do this.\nSheldon: You don\xe2\x80\x99t know what it\xe2\x80\x99s like to feel completely frustrated. To have a desire build up within you and be denied any opportunity for release.\nAmy: Yeah, sounds like a drag.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nPenny: Okay, help me out here. Why does he love this show so much?\nBernadette: Well, there was action, it was funny. I mean, you do get that usually the monster chases the pretty girl, but this time the pretty girl chases the monsters?\nPenny: Yippee, it\xe2\x80\x99s backwards. I get it.\nBernadette: Why does this bother you so much?\nPenny: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. It\xe2\x80\x99s just, he\xe2\x80\x99s so passionate about so many different things. I just don\xe2\x80\x99t get that way. Do you?\nBernadette: Well, sure. I\xe2\x80\x99m pretty passionate about science. I remember the first time I looked through a microscope and saw millions of tiny microorganisms. It was like a whole other universe. If I wanted to, I could wipe it out with my thumb like a god.\nPenny: See? I wish I had some of that fire in my life. I mean, I want to care about things and get excited like you guys.\nBernadette: Well, there\xe2\x80\x99s no reason you can\xe2\x80\x99t.\nPenny: You think?\nBernadette: Absolutely. All we need to do is spend a little time and find something you\xe2\x80\x99re passionate about.\nPenny: Ugh, that sounds like a lot of work.\nScene: Raj\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nHoward (on webcam): Hey, what\xe2\x80\x99s up?\nRaj: Uh, Lucy\xe2\x80\x99s coming over. I need some advice.\nHoward: However long you think the foreplay should be, triple it.\nRaj: Just tell me which one you think is more manly. This hockey jersey or this football jersey.\nHoward: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Go with hockey.\nRaj: Good, black is more slimming. Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s her. I got to go be butch. Toodles. Hey.\nLucy: Hi.\nRaj: Come in.\nLucy: Oh, look how cute your little doggy is.\nRaj: Yeah, well, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t get too close. If I give the right command in German, she\xe2\x80\x99ll rip your face off.\nScene: The apartment. Montage of scenes.\n1. Amy (singing): O\xe2\x80\x99er the land of the free, and the home of the\xe2\x80\xa6 Next.\n2. (Sheldon is laying out an intricate pattern of dominoes) Amy: That\xe2\x80\x99s quite an impressive layout, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\nSheldon: Yes.\nAmy: Let\xe2\x80\x99s box it up.\nSheldon: Let\xe2\x80\x99s box it up.\n3. (Sheldon is turning the handle on a jack-in-the-box. Just before the end of the tune) Amy: That\xe2\x80\x99s enough. Sheldon, Sheldon, give it!\n4. Amy: Okay, Sheldon, make a wish and blow out the candles. Oops, missed one. Now your wish can\xe2\x80\x99t come true.\nSheldon: Lucky for you, \xe2\x80\x99cause I wished you were dead.\nScene: Raj\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nLucy: I like your jersey.\nRaj: Thanks. I love hockey.\nLucy: Oh, cool. So does my dad. We watched it all the time growing up. Who\xe2\x80\x99s your favourite player?\nRaj: Not Brian Boitano, that\xe2\x80\x99s for sure. How\xe2\x80\x99s your burrito?\nLucy: It\xe2\x80\x99s still a little frozen in the middle.\nRaj: Probably because I didn\xe2\x80\x99t read the instructions. No wrapper\xe2\x80\x99s going to tell me what to do. Unless his name is Jay-Z.\nLucy: Is something going on?\nRaj: What do you mean?\nLucy: Well, you\xe2\x80\x99re acting all weird, and I\xe2\x80\x99m pretty weird, so I think I know what I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about.\nRaj: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s all those steroids I\xe2\x80\x99ve been taking.\nLucy: I think I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna go. Thank you for the burrito and the pork rinds and the 20-minute lecture on why monster trucks are better than regular trucks.\nRaj: Wait, wait. I, I found your blog here you wrote about me.\nLucy: Oh. I kind of just write that for myself. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t think anybody actually read it.\nRaj: No kidding. You didn\xe2\x80\x99t make it easy to find. I spent hours digging around online. For the record, you have excellent credit scores. And your diabetic aunt seems to be adjusting to her new leg just fine.\nLucy: Why were you acting so strange tonight?\nRaj: You called me feminine. And I, I wanted you to think I was more manly.\nLucy: Raj, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t say feminine was a bad thing. I meant that you\xe2\x80\x99re sweet and thoughtful and your skin looks so much like caramel, I just want to dip an apple in your face.\nRaj: I do have a pretty balls-to-the-wall moisturising regimen.\nLucy: So, are you okay?\nRaj: Yeah.\nLucy: Good. Do you even like hockey?\nRaj: No. Bought this at the Staples Center when I went to see Taylor Swift.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nPenny: So, I was thinking how excited you get about stuff like Buffy or science or which TV remote you and Sheldon should buy.\nLeonard: The Harmony One was fine. We didn\xe2\x80\x99t need to upgrade to the eleven hundred, which he knows is too big for my hand.\nPenny: See, that\xe2\x80\x99s the kind of passion I didn\xe2\x80\x99t think I had. But then I realized I\xe2\x80\x99m passionate about you.\nLeonard: Oh, my cute little tushy strikes again.\nPenny: No, I\xe2\x80\x99m serious. Look, I\xe2\x80\x99ve always had these plans. I was gonna be in movies and live this glamorous life, and anything less than that just wasn\xe2\x80\x99t worth getting excited about.\nLeonard: Those things can still happen.\nPenny: Oh, obviously it\xe2\x80\x99s gonna happen. Yeah, a psychic at a bachelorette party told me so. Anyway, what I meant was, I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t wait, you know? I\xe2\x80\x99ve got you, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got Sheldon, all these wonderful friends. My life is exciting right now.\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99s a big deal.\nPenny: It is, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\nLeonard: So, does that mean we get to do stuff like talk about cool shows or get dressed up in matching costumes and go to Comic-Con?\nPenny: Leonard, I had an epiphany, not a stroke.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Amy, I must say, I was sceptical at first, but this has truly been a transformative evening.\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99m a little surprised to hear you feeling so positive.\nSheldon: Well, you\xe2\x80\x99re an excellent neuroscientist, you\xe2\x80\x99re a wonderful girlfriend, and\xe2\x80\xa6\nAmy: And?\nSheldon: Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter, does it?\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99m proud of you, Sheldon. (Exits.)\nSheldon: And a complete sucker.\n(Montage of sccenes)\n1. (Redraws tic-tac-toe board) Sheldon: Oh, yeah.\n2. (Blows out all candles on the cake)\n3. (Winds up jack-in-the-box until it pops out.) Sheldon: There he is.\n4. Sheldon (singing): And the home of the brave.\n5. (Knocks over first of intricate domino pattern) Sheldon: Don\xe2\x80\x99t stop. Yes, keep going. Just like that.\nAlmost there, almost there. Uh-huh-huh!\nPenny: Sheldon, you big weirdo, I want you to know that I love that you\xe2\x80\x99re in my life.\nSheldon: I love you, too.\nScene: Later.\nSheldon: Hello. Uh, is this the Bruce Miller who wrote the season finale of Alphas? Oh, smashing. Yeah, you already sound nicer than the last Bruce Miller who suggested I have sexual relations with myself. Now, down to business. Um, your show ended on a cliffhanger. Could you please tell me how you planned to resolve it? Uh-huh. Mm-hmm. I see. Well, that all stinks. No wonder you got cancelled. Bye.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
