b'Scene: The apartment.\nPenny (entering): Hi. Did Sheldon change the Wi-Fi password again?\nLeonard: Yeah, it\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cPenny already eats our food, she can pay for Wi-Fi.\xe2\x80\x9d No spaces.\nPenny: Okay. If you can\xe2\x80\x99t get me to stop eating your food, what makes you think you can get me to stop using your Wi-Fi?\nSheldon: I believe that you\xe2\x80\x99re capable of great change. Like when I finally got you to stop saying Valentimes Day.\nLeonard: You want to hear something weird?\nPenny: Sure.\nSheldon: In the year 2000, Pope John Paul II was named an honorary Harlem Globetrotter.\nLeonard: What are you talking about?\nSheldon: You asked Penny if she wanted to hear something weird.\nLeonard: Yeah, because I have something weird to tell her.\nSheldon: Oh. I thought it was a game.\nPenny: What\xe2\x80\x99s yours?\nLeonard: There\xe2\x80\x99s this guy, Jimmy Speckerman, who used to torment me in high school. He sent me a message through Facebook. He\xe2\x80\x99s in town and wants to have drinks.\nSheldon: Okay, Penny, if it were a game, here are your choices. An e-mail from an old acquaintance, or the head of one of the largest religious institutions in the world slam dunking to Sweet Georgia Brown. Pick.\nLeonard: Just do it, \xe2\x80\x99cause he\xe2\x80\x99s not gonna let it go.\nPenny: Basketball Pope.\nSheldon: And that\xe2\x80\x99s how it\xe2\x80\x99s done.\nPenny: What are you gonna do about your bully? Are you gonna see him?\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\nSheldon: Is this the fellow who peed in your Hawaiian Punch?\nLeonard: No, that was a different guy.\nSheldon: Was he the one who wedgied you so hard, your testicle reascended, and you spent your whole Christmas break waiting for it to come back down?\nLeonard: No, that was a different, different guy.\nSheldon: Was he the one who used your head to open a nut?\nLeonard: No.\nSheldon: Oh, oh, oh. Was he the one who made you eat your arm hair?\nLeonard: No, but, actually, that was this guy\xe2\x80\x99s sister.\nPenny: All right, well, what do you think he wants?\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\nSheldon: You know, the holidays are just around the corner. Maybe he wants to see if he can lodge the other testicle up there.\nLeonard: I told you. That was a different guy.\nPenny: Hmm. That\xe2\x80\x99s too bad. We could have spent New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Eve waiting for the ball to drop.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s two a.m. What are you doing up?\nSheldon: Nobel Prize acceptance ceremony streaming live from Stockholm.\nLeonard: Sure. You want to see what all the scientists are wearing this year.\nSheldon: Look at these men. They\xe2\x80\x99ve managed to win the top science prize in the world with no more understanding of the quantum underpinnings of the expansion of the early universe than God gave a goose. You should pay attention, Leonard. Someday this could be you up there.\nLeonard: Thanks.\nSheldon: So, what\xe2\x80\x99s got you up? Did you have a bad clam?\nLeonard: I didn\xe2\x80\x99t have clams.\nSheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t watch you 24 hours a day. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you do.\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s this Jimmy Speckerman thing. I can\xe2\x80\x99t decide if I should agree to see him or not. Of course that might be because the last time I ran into him, he made me floss with my own shoelaces.\nSheldon: Wear loafers. Look at Dr. Saul Perlmutter up there, clutching that Nobel Prize. What\xe2\x80\x99s the matter, Saul? You afraid someone\xe2\x80\x99s going to steal it? Like you stole Einstein\xe2\x80\x99s cosmological constant?\nLeonard: You know what? I am tired of living in fear of this guy. I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna go see him and finally say all the things I should have said in high school. You know, pick on someone your own size, you did not have sex with my mother, and yes, I do know why I\xe2\x80\x99m hitting myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\nSheldon: Oh, now Perlmutter\xe2\x80\x99s shaking the King\xe2\x80\x99s hand. Yeah, check for your watch, Gustaf. He might have lifted it.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom.\nBernadette: I love this dress. How come I never see you wear it?\nPenny: \xe2\x80\x98Cause when I wear it, it\xe2\x80\x99s a shirt. So, what\xe2\x80\x99s Howard doing tonight?\nBernadette: Oh, they all went with Leonard to confront his childhood bully.\nPenny: Oh, terrific. High school quarterback against four mathletes.\nAmy: When Leonard gets back, I\xe2\x80\x99d love to check his serotonin levels. Do you think he\xe2\x80\x99d let me draw a syringe full of his blood?\nPenny: Hmm, he\xe2\x80\x99s not crazy about needles, but if you get him to go jogging, it\xe2\x80\x99ll just pour out of his nose.\nBernadette: I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I can meet the girl who was always mean to me. Tammy Bodnick. One time while I was in gym class, she stole all my clothes and left an elf costume in my locker.\nPenny: Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s awful.\nBernadette: Worst part was, it was too big.\nAmy: That\xe2\x80\x99s nothing. In ninth grade, the girls put Rogaine in my hand lotion. Within six months, the nicknames began to fly. I think the one that hurt the most was Gorilla Fingers Fowler.\nPenny: Wow. You poor thing.\nBernadette: What about you?\nPenny: Oh. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I guess my school was a nice place. We didn\xe2\x80\x99t really have bullies.\nAmy: Come on, no one ever gave anyone mean nicknames or picked on them or put gum in their hairy knuckles so the school nurse had to use peanut butter to get it out?\nPenny: No, we weren\xe2\x80\x99t really like that. I mean, look, we played pranks on each other, but it was never mean. Like, okay, this one girl, Kathy Geiger, got really good grades, so we blindfolded her, tied her up and left her in a cornfield overnight.\nBernadette: Oh, my God, that\xe2\x80\x99s awful.\nPenny: No, it was funny. Everyone laughed.\nAmy: Did Kathy Geiger laugh?\nPenny: Uh, probably. It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to say. She kind of had an ear of corn in her mouth.\nAmy: Who would have thought Fuzzy Fingers Fowler is best friends with a bully?\nPenny: What? I was not a bully.\nBernadette: Kind of sounds like you were. And maybe a felon.\nAmy: Shh. That\xe2\x80\x99s how you wind up in a cornfield.\nScene: A bar.\nRaj: Is that him over there?\nLeonard: No.\nRaj: How about that guy? He looks like he\xe2\x80\x99d hate you.\nLeonard: You know, I can really do this by myself.\nHoward: Hey, we\xe2\x80\x99re here to support you, buddy.\nLeonard: No, you\xe2\x80\x99re not. You\xe2\x80\x99re here to see if I get my underwear pulled over my head.\nHoward: You wore underwear? You fool.\nRaj: So, have you figured out what you\xe2\x80\x99re going to say to him?\nLeonard: You bet. I am going to make him apologize for all the crap he pulled on me in school.\nHoward: That\xe2\x80\x99s quite a list. I can\xe2\x80\x99t read your handwriting, what\xe2\x80\x99s that word?\nLeonard: Scrotum.\nRaj: What\xe2\x80\x99s that one?\nLeonard: Uh, stapled.\nJimmy (arriving): Leonard.\nLeonard: Oh, hi.\nJimmy: Holy crap, man, it\xe2\x80\x99s good to see you.\nLeonard: Yeah. You, too. Uh, Jimmy, this is Sheldon and Raj and Howard.\nJimmy: Hi. Fellas. Hey, can I get a beer? Wow. Look at you. Little Leonard Hofstadter. I hear you\xe2\x80\x99re a big-time scientist now.\nSheldon: And there\xe2\x80\x99s the first zinger. Ouch.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m doing okay, I guess.\nJimmy: Okay? Come on, I read online you\xe2\x80\x99re a physicist at a university, you won some medal.\nLeonard: The Newcomb medal.\nJimmy: Yeah, congratulations.\nSheldon: Congratulations? The Newcomb medal? Oh, please. That\xe2\x80\x99s the scientific equivalent of a smiley face sticker on your homework.\nJimmy: From what I read, it sounded like a big deal.\nSheldon: Oh, good Lord, are we going to stand here and listen to him tear Leonard apart like this?\nRaj: Hey, I won a Newcomb medal, too.\nSheldon: My point.\nJimmy: You should have seen this guy back in the day. Huh? He was so little, he could fit in just about anywhere. Lockers, trash cans. Oh, man, how did you get inside that backpack?\nLeonard: Oh, I can\xe2\x80\x99t take all the credit. You helped a lot.\nJimmy: Yeah. We were practically a comedy team.\nHoward: Like the Black Death and Europe.\nLeonard: Jimmy, I\xe2\x80\x99m kind of curious why you wanted to see me.\nJimmy: Okay, here it is. I have this great money-making idea. I just need a gear head to get it to the finish line.\nSheldon: Technically, Howard\xe2\x80\x99s the gear head. Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s just a dime store laser jockey.\nLeonard: What\xe2\x80\x99s the idea?\nJimmy: This is just between us, right?\nLeonard: Right.\nJimmy: Okay. What do you think about a pair of glasses that makes any movie you want into 3D?\nRaj: That sounds amazing. First movie I\xe2\x80\x99m watching, Annie.\nHoward: How exactly would these glasses work?\nJimmy: How the hell should I know? That\xe2\x80\x99s why I need a nerd.\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t think something like that\xe2\x80\x99s even possible.\nJimmy: Aw, come on, you can figure it out. You\xe2\x80\x99re like the smartest guy I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever known.\nSheldon: The smartest? All right, you know, I may not have a firm grasp on sarcasm, but even I know that was a doozy. Leonard, you can\xe2\x80\x99t live in fear of this man forever.\nLeonard: Sheldon, I got this.\nSheldon: You clearly don\xe2\x80\x99t. What my spineless friend lacks the courage to say is you\xe2\x80\x99re a terrible person who took advantage of his tiny size, his uncoordinated nature and his congenital lack of masculinity.\nLeonard: Sheldon.\nSheldon: Leonard, I platonically love you, man, but face it, you\xe2\x80\x99re a mess.\nJimmy: I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand.\nLeonard: I think what he\xe2\x80\x99s trying to say is that maybe in high school you picked on me a little bit.\nSheldon: A little bit? The man Super Glued Hershey\xe2\x80\x99s Kisses to your nipples.\nRaj: That\xe2\x80\x99s funny because those aren\xe2\x80\x99t the kind of kisses you want on your nipples.\nJimmy: What is that?\nSheldon: This is a list of your heinous acts against Leonard. One of which is certainly the cause of him wetting his bed well into his teens.\nLeonard: 14 is not, oh , yeah, never mind.\nJimmy: What\xe2\x80\x99s this word?\nLeonard: Nancy. You called me Nancy for three years.\nSheldon: You really need to work on your penmanship.\nJimmy: Oh, man, I, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to say. I always thought we were just having some fun.\nLeonard: It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t fun for me.\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re being too kind, Leonard. You ruined him.\nLeonard: Come on, guys.\nRaj: That was pretty badass, dude.\nSheldon: I help the weak. It\xe2\x80\x99s yet another way I\xe2\x80\x99m exactly like Batman.\nLeonard: Hey, for the record, Jimmy wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the reason I wet the bed. That one has my mother written all over it.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom. Penny is on the phone.\nPenny: Anyway, I\xe2\x80\x99m really sorry I made fun of your stutter in high school.\nBernadette: You\xe2\x80\x99re doing great.\nPenny: Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Oh, God, just finish the sentence. Okay, well, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry you feel that way. Bye. No one wants to hear my apologies.\nAmy: I think your mistake is doing it over the phone. If they could look into your eyes, they\xe2\x80\x99d melt.\nBernadette: Penny, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter what you did in the past. You\xe2\x80\x99re a good person now.\nPenny: That\xe2\x80\x99s easy for you to say. You weren\xe2\x80\x99t just called a b-b-b-b-bitch.\nAmy: Perhaps you could assuage your guilt through altruism. Which word\xe2\x80\x99s tripping you up? Assuage or altruism?\nPenny: Both.\nBernadette: You\xe2\x80\x99ll feel better by doing something nice for someone.\nPenny: I actually knew that.\nAmy: I never doubted you.\nBernadette: Every other week I serve at a soup kitchen downtown.\nPenny: Ooh, I can\xe2\x80\x99t do that. If I stand over a steaming pot, my hair just goes boing! What else could I do?\nAmy: There\xe2\x80\x99s Habitat for Humanity, building houses for the poor.\nPenny: Okay, come on, I don\xe2\x80\x99t even have my own house, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to build one for someone else?\nAmy: How about donating some of your clothes?\nPenny: Oh, my God, that\xe2\x80\x99s perfect. \xe2\x80\x98Cause I have so many clothes I don\xe2\x80\x99t wear, and they\xe2\x80\x99re just taking up space, and I go shopping to buy more stuff and I have no place to put it. This will totally fix that.\nBernadette: What about helping people?\nPenny: And helping people.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: Here\xe2\x80\x99s your cocoa.\nSheldon: Oh, half and half instead of whole milk?\nLeonard: Yes.\nSheldon: Heated to precisely 183 degrees?\nLeonard: Yes.\nSheldon: Seven little marshmallows, no more no less?\nLeonard: You got one for good luck. (Knock on door) I\xe2\x80\x99ll get it.\nSheldon: One for good luck. Must be the kind of math they do at Princeton.\nJimmy: Hey.\nLeonard: What are you doing here?\nJimmy: I want to apologize for stapling your balls and throwing you naked in the girls\xe2\x80\x99 locker room, stuffing that parrot down your pants. What\xe2\x80\x99s this word?\nLeonard: Laxative.\nJimmy: Oh, right. Junior prom. That was not cool, man. I am so, so sorry.\nLeonard: Really?\nJimmy: Yeah. I just hope you can forgive me.\nLeonard: Uh, yeah. Sure, I guess.\nJimmy: You\xe2\x80\x99re a beautiful guy.\nLeonard: Well, yeah, thanks, Jimmy.\nJimmy: Okay, I got to go.\nLeonard: Are you okay to drive?\nJimmy: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I drive better drunk. You know, it makes you pay attention.\nLeonard: No, no, no, come on in. I\xe2\x80\x99ll make you a cup of coffee.\nJimmy: I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be imposing?\nLeonard: No.\nSheldon: Yes.\nLeonard: Sheldon, we can\xe2\x80\x99t let him drive.\nSheldon: Then take away his keys and make him wander the streets with the other drunks.\nLeonard: You remember Sheldon and Raj and Howard.\nJimmy: Not really, no. It\xe2\x80\x99s funny, huh, Leonard? Back in school, I was the winner and you were the loser. And now we\xe2\x80\x99re reversed. You\xe2\x80\x99re the winner.\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99d think a winner could make a decent cup of cocoa.\nJimmy: You mind if I use your bathroom?\nLeonard: Yeah, just back there.\nHoward: How about that? After all these years, your big bad high school bully finally apologizes.\nLeonard: Yeah. It kind of rekindles your faith in the basic goodness of people.\nSheldon: You know what would be nice?\nRaj: What\xe2\x80\x99s that?\nSheldon: As a symbolic gesture to all the bullies who\xe2\x80\x99ve tormented us for years, we open our home to Jimmy and once he\xe2\x80\x99s asleep we kill him. I said it would be nice, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t say we should do it.\nScene: The clothing bank.\nPenny: Ah, I feel just like Mother Teresa. Except for the virgin part. That ship sailed a long time ago.\nBernadette: I think Mother Teresa would have washed the clothes first.\nPenny: Yeah, well, I bet her laundry room wasn\xe2\x80\x99t down five flights of stairs. You know, giving really is better than receiving. I used to think it was such a cliche, but it seems to be the\xe2\x80\xa6 oh, look at these cute jeans someone just threw away.\nBernadette: Donated.\nPenny: Yes, to a poor waitress who loves a boot cut.\nBernadette: Penny.\nPenny: Come on, they would be so cute on me, and, ah, they go great with this sweater!\nAmy: I don\xe2\x80\x99t think Mother Teresa\xe2\x80\xa6 Oh, that is adorable.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Leonard.\nLeonard: Yeah.\nSheldon: In case it comes up again, this right here is an imposition.\nLeonard: What was I supposed to do? He needed a place to sleep it off.\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re soft. This world\xe2\x80\x99s going to chew you up and spit you out.\nJimmy (belching): When did I have tacos?\nLeonard: Morning, Jimmy.\nSheldon: Oh, there it is, tacos.\nJimmy: Man, I tied one on.\nLeonard: Yeah, you did. So, uh, listen, it was great to see you again. And , and, and thanks for the apology.\nJimmy: What apology?\nLeonard: For all the crappy stuff you did to me in high school.\nJimmy: Geez, you\xe2\x80\x99re still harping on that? What a puss.\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99s my French toast.\nJimmy: It\xe2\x80\x99s good. You really know your way around a kitchen, Nancy.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to say I told you so, but we could have killed him.\nLeonard: I might kill him right now.\nSheldon: The Dark Knight has your back. He\xe2\x80\x99s scared, but he has your back.\nLeonard: Okay, Jimmy, it\xe2\x80\x99s time for you to go.\nJimmy: Yeah, all right, let me just finish this.\nLeonard: No, you\xe2\x80\x99re done. I want you out of my apartment right now.\nSheldon: Well said, Boy Wonder.\nJimmy: Or what?\nSheldon: Don\xe2\x80\x99t answer that. It\xe2\x80\x99s a trick question. I speak from experience.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m not afraid of you any more, Jimmy. Now get out! (Pushes him) Uh-oh.\nScene: Running down the stairwell.\nSheldon: You did it, Leonard, you stood up to your bully.\nLeonard: Yeah, I feel pretty good about myself. You think we can outrun him?\nSheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t need to outrun him, I just need to outrun you.\nScene: The clothes bank.\nBernadette: I don\xe2\x80\x99t feel good about this.\nPenny: Then sit in the car and keep it running.\nAmy: You were right, a whole new load.\nPenny: Come on, yoga top. Mama needs a new yoga top.\nAmy: Check it out, Bernadette, suede boots, your size.\nBernadette: God, they\xe2\x80\x99re cute. Oh, why did they have to be cute?\nPenny: Wait, wait, wait, guys, just hang on.\nAmy: What is it, the fuzz?\nPenny: Look at us. What are we doing?\nAmy: I was gleefully following you to a life of crime, looking forward to the day we might be cell mates. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know about Bernadette.\nPenny: You know, this is wrong. Let\xe2\x80\x99s put everything back. Here.\nBernadette (taking boots and running): It\xe2\x80\x99s okay, I serve soup to poor people!\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
