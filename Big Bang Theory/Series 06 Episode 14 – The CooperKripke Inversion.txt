b'Scene: The Apartment.\nLeonard: Sheldon, your food\xe2\x80\x99s getting cold.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99ll eat later. Right now, I\xe2\x80\x99m suckling at the informative bosom of mother physics.\nPenny: It\xe2\x80\x99s hot when Sheldon talks dirty.\nRaj: So, I found this Web site where you send them pictures, they sculpt your head and make an action figure out of you. How awesome is that?\nHoward: Let me see.\nRaj: Yeah, you can pick your wardrobe. You can even choose your accessories.\nHoward: Leonard, you can get a little asthma inhaler.\nLeonard: Oh, this is neat. Think about all the action figures we\xe2\x80\x99ve bought over the years. It would be kind of cool to have ones that look like us. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you think?\nPenny: Yeah, if that\xe2\x80\x99s your idea of what\xe2\x80\x99s cool, you should get one.\nLeonard: Yeah, so, I\xe2\x80\x99m out.\nRaj: What do you think, Sheldon? Want an action figure that looks just like you?\nSheldon: Would it come with Kung-Fu grip?\nRaj: No.\nSheldon: Don\xe2\x80\x99t waste my time.\nLeonard: You get that these are personalised action figures.\nPenny: Honey, if you want one, just get one.\nHoward: You\xe2\x80\x99re still out, right?\nLeonard: Yep.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s office.\nSheldon: A hush falls over the crowd as Cooper studies the board. He makes his move. He\xe2\x80\x99s dividing both sides by I. He\xe2\x80\x99s adding back the coefficient. He has a value for P. He\xe2\x80\x99s plugging that back in. He takes the derivative, and he solves the equation. The crowd goes wild. Nobel! Nobel!\nKripke: Cooper?\nSheldon: Nobel. Kripke. Don\xe2\x80\x99t look at my board.\nKripke: What\xe2\x80\x99s that?\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s a drawing of a really cool train. Don\xe2\x80\x99t look at that, either. What do you want?\nKripke: I have some bad news. You\xe2\x80\x99re working on a gwant pwoposal fow a new fusion weactow. I\xe2\x80\x99m working on a gwant pwoposal fow a new fusion weactow. The university is only awowed to submit one pwoposal.\nSheldon: So they asked you to pack up your things and ship out. That\xe2\x80\x99s hard cheese, Barry. You\xe2\x80\x99re one of the good ones.\nKripke: No, they\xe2\x80\x99re making us work together.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s ridiculous. I am one of the great minds of our generation. I work on a level so rarified you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t even imagine it. I said stop looking at my cool train!\nScene: Howard\xe2\x80\x99s lab.\nLeonard: Hmm. Kind of a strange place to put a picture of you and Bernadette.\nHoward: Well, I wanted everybody to know I love my wife. And nobody to know I forgot to turn off the laser.\nRaj: They\xe2\x80\x99re here. Our action figures have arrived. This is the best five hundred dollars I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever spent.\nLeonard: A thousand dollars on action figures? How can you afford that?\nHoward: Easy. His family\xe2\x80\x99s loaded, and Bernadette has a great job. My wife came with both fun bags and money bags.\nRaj: Say hello to an exact scale model of me. Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m not dark chocolate. I\xe2\x80\x99m melt-in-your-mouth caramel.\nHoward: Oh, man. Look at my nose.\nLeonard: Maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s a shipping problem.\nHoward: What?\nLeonard: Yeah. Maybe Wesley Snipes and Toucan Sam just got action figures that look like you guys.\nRaj: This sucks.\nHoward: I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe I wasted all that money.\nLeonard: Aw, and my girlfriend wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t let me get one. Look at my face. Do I look smug? I feel smug.\nScene: The stairwell.\nPenny: I hate it when you make me sit through all the credits.\nLeonard: Well, sometimes there\xe2\x80\x99s a secret ending, like in The Avengers.\nPenny: Yeah, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x99s going to happen in a documentary about the Holocaust.\nLeonard: They could show bloopers. Oh, no.\nPenny: What is that?\nLeonard: That is Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m unhappy and about to destroy the planet\xe2\x80\x9d music. Come on, let\xe2\x80\x99s just go to your place.\nPenny: Well, wait, if he\xe2\x80\x99s unhappy,shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t we talk to him?\nLeonard: Shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t we talk to him? Have you learned nothing in six years?\nPenny (entering apartment): You doing okay, sweetie?\nSheldon: There is ominous music playing, and there is an afghan over my head. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know where you\xe2\x80\x99re from, but where I\xe2\x80\x99m from, that means I\xe2\x80\x99m not doing okay.\nLeonard: Want me to make you some tea?\nSheldon: Tea is for when I\xe2\x80\x99m upset. I\xe2\x80\x99m not upset. The university\xe2\x80\x99s forcing me to work with Kripke. I\xe2\x80\x99m outraged.\nLeonard: So, cocoa?\nSheldon: Yes, cocoa. Do you have any idea what it\xe2\x80\x99s like to be paired with someone who\xe2\x80\x99s so incredibly annoying?\nLeonard: Oh, teacher! Me! Me!\nSheldon: See, I did all this great work, and now he\xe2\x80\x99s just going to come along and ruin it. I am angrier than ever and filled with despair.\nPenny: What beverage do you make for that?\nLeonard: Oh, no, no, no, I know this. Uh, hot apple cider with cinnamon sticks?\nSheldon: Yes, hot apple cider with cinnamon sticks!\nScene: Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s office.\nKripke: What the fwig, Cooper? We were supposed to meet in my office a half an hour ago.\nSheldon: And yet, now you\xe2\x80\x99re in my office. Point, Cooper. Welcome to the Thunderdome, Kripke.\nKripke: We agweed to exchange copies of our work. Let me see yours.\nSheldon: Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you show me yours first.\nKripke: You think I just few off the turnip twuck? We exchange at the same time.\nSheldon: How do I know you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to take my ideas and publish them as your own?\nKripke: How do I know you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to do that with mine?\nSheldon: Because I\xe2\x80\x99m not interested in getting published in Mad magazine. Zingers fly fast in the Thunderdome, Barry.\nKripke: Are we going to do this or not? Thank you. So, we wead each other\xe2\x80\x99s work, meet again tomowow?\nSheldon: Fine.\nKripke: Nice twy. This is bwank paper.\nSheldon: And I am sure it\xe2\x80\x99s still more valuable than whatever\xe2\x80\x99s in here.\nKripke: Cough it up, Cooper.\nSheldon: Very well.\nKripke: If this one\xe2\x80\x99s bwank, too, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to be fuwious.\nSheldon: Fine.\nScene: Howard\xe2\x80\x99s lab.\nRaj: You! Always bet on black.\nHoward: Get that waste of money out of my face.\nRaj: It\xe2\x80\x99s only a waste of money if we don\xe2\x80\x99t play with them. (As doll) He\xe2\x80\x99s right, dawg.\nHoward: Please, I\xe2\x80\x99m working.\nRaj: You know, there is a way we can get action figures to look exactly like us.\nHoward: Oh, yeah? How\xe2\x80\x99s that?\nRaj: Two words, 3-D printer. Wait, maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s three words. No, hang on. Okay, one word, a letter and a number and maybe a hyphen. 3-D printer.\nHoward: I have always wanted a 3-D printer.\nRaj: Of course you have. They\xe2\x80\x99re an engineer\xe2\x80\x99s dream. Anything you can design, a 3-D printer can make out of plastic.\nHoward: Yeah, but they\xe2\x80\x99re so expensive.\nRaj: Oh, come on. You deserve one. You\xe2\x80\x99ve worked hard to find a woman who makes a lot of money.\nHoward: Well, the prices have been coming down.\nRaj: Oh, true. They\xe2\x80\x99re practically giving them away. You know, in exchange for money.\nHoward: And we can make stuff we need for work with it. Prototypes of my CAD/CAM designs, specialized tools\xe2\x80\xa6\nRaj: Not to mention Malibu Koothrappali and his totally bitchin\xe2\x80\x99 dream house.\nHoward: We don\xe2\x80\x99t need Malibu Koothrappali\xe2\x80\x99s dream house.\nRaj: Really, smart guy? Where\xe2\x80\x99s he supposed to park his sweet little Corvette?\nScene: The apartment.\nAmy:The monkey in my tobacco study has taken to smoking a pipe. I\xe2\x80\x99m supposed to remove his brain to examine, but it\xe2\x80\x99s hard because now he reminds me of my uncle. You\xe2\x80\x99ve been awfully quiet tonight. Is everything okay?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m fine.\nAmy: All right, well, how was work today? Did you exchange your research with Kripke?\nSheldon: Yes.\nAmy: Sheldon, what\xe2\x80\x99s going on?\nSheldon: I read his research, and, it\xe2\x80\x99s leaps and bounds ahead of mine. Which means the mommy of the smartest physicist at the university is not my mommy as I had thought. It\xe2\x80\x99s his mommy.\nAmy: Sheldon, I wish there was something I could do to make you feel better. May I offer you a consoling hug?\nSheldon: What do we have to lose?\nAmy: How\xe2\x80\x99s that?\nSheldon: I feel like I\xe2\x80\x99m being strangled by a boa constrictor. Why\xe2\x80\x99d you stop?\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: Come on, Sheldon, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be late.\nSheldon: I can\xe2\x80\x99t go in today. I\xe2\x80\x99m sick.\nLeonard: You\xe2\x80\x99re not sick. You just don\xe2\x80\x99t want to face Kripke.\nSheldon: No, look.\nLeonard: 128.\nSheldon: See?\nLeonard: What did you do, put this in your tea?\nSheldon: Oh, dear. Now I\xe2\x80\x99m not even smarter than you.\nLeonard: Sheldon, Kripke\xe2\x80\x99s not smarter than you. You just got stuck on a wrong path. Happened to Einstein. He got stuck on the unified field theory for decades.\nSheldon: Oh, don\xe2\x80\x99t play the Einstein card. His great breakthroughs happened when no one knew anything. So everything was a great breakthrough.\nLeonard: Sheldon Lee Cooper, I do not have time for this nonsense. Now, go put your clothes on, get in the car, and lets go to work.\nSheldon: All right, geez. What a grouch.\nLeonard: How did I do that? I got to remember how I did that.\nScene: Howard\xe2\x80\x99s lab.\nHoward: Do you realize, by owning a 3-D printer, we are reclaiming the manufacturing process and taking jobs back from sweatshops in China?\nRaj: I think this thing was made in China.\nHoward: Eh, what can you do?\nRaj: Ooh, I, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s done. Oh, it worked. We printed a whistle.\nHoward: Amazing. You realize these things go for 25 cents a pop at a party store.\nRaj: And we made it in only three hours. Sounds just like store-bought.\nHoward: Okay, give me a superhero pose, and I will scan you into the computer for your action figure.\nRaj: Oh, I wish I was in better shape.\nHoward: Stop holding your stomach in. I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you a six-pack with the computer.\nRaj: Oh, okay, great. Now I can look like Val Kilmer as Batman instead of Val Kilmer as he looks today.\nHoward: All right, you can suck it in a little bit.\nScene: Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s office.\nKripke: Cooper, we have a pwobwem. Your work is weawy not at a wevew I expected it to be.\nSheldon: I know. Go ahead, mock me. Just use small words so I understand.\nKripke: Don\xe2\x80\x99t pway dumb with me. We both know what your pwobwem is.\nSheldon: We do?\nKripke: You have a girlfwiend.\nSheldon: So?\nKripke: So my work would suffew, too, if I was getting waid all the time.\nSheldon: Yes. That is the reason. My work is suffering because of all the laid I\xe2\x80\x99m getting.\nKripke: You wucky bastard.\nSheldon: What can I say, you know? She enjoys my genitals. I am giving them to her on a nightly basis.\nKripke: Okay, stop bwagging. You had some bwiwiant insights in here, but if we\xe2\x80\x99re gonna make this work, you need to buckew down and focus.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99ll do what I can. But it\xe2\x80\x99s not going to be easy, because when I\xe2\x80\x99m with Amy and our bathing suit areas mush together, boy howdy, is it magic\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nHoward: Oh, good, you\xe2\x80\x99re home. Got a little surprise for you.\nBernadette: What?\nHoward: Say hello to my little friend.\nBernadette: Oh, my God. That\xe2\x80\x99s so cute. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t think there could be a smaller version of you.\nHoward: I know, right? And, thanks to photographs and a little 3-D modeling, here comes the bride.\nBernadette: Oh, Howie, I love these.\nHoward: I thought you might.\nBernadette: Were they expensive?\nHoward: Didn\xe2\x80\x99t cost a thing. I made them myself.\nBernadette: How?\nHoward: Koothrappali and I bought a used 3-D printer for $5,000.\nBernadette: $5,000 for a couple of dolls? Are you out of your mind?\nHoward: Not just for a couple of dolls. For as many dolls as we want. And whistles.\nBernadette: At any point, did it dawn on you to talk to me about spending this kind of money?\nHoward: It\xe2\x80\x99s kind of dawning on me now.\nBernadette: I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe you. Howie, we can\xe2\x80\x99t afford to waste money on junk like this.\nHoward: What are you talking about? We make plenty of money.\nBernadette: I make plenty of money. You make peanuts.\nHoward: Yes, but we\xe2\x80\x99re married now. That means, when you get sick, I take care of you. And when you make a bunch of money, I get to buy stuff. Sorry if you don\xe2\x80\x99t like it, but that\xe2\x80\x99s how love works.\nBernadette: No, here\xe2\x80\x99s how love works. You\xe2\x80\x99re gonna return the machine, or you can print out a working set of lady parts and sleep with those. Oh, my God! Are you actually thinking about it?\nScene: The apartment.\nPenny: All right, I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand. Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you just tell Kripke the truth?\nSheldon: Because the truth made me look bad, whereas a ridiculous bald-faced lie makes me look good. Anyway, if Kripke asks, tell him my coitus with Amy is frequent, intense and whimsically inventive.\nLeonard: Is my coitus whimsically inventive?\nPenny: That is what I write on the bathroom walls. For a whimsically inventive time, call Leonard Hofstadter.\nLeonard: I know you\xe2\x80\x99re joking, but I\xe2\x80\x99d be okay with that.\nPenny: Yeah. Sheldon, can I ask you a question?\nSheldon: Of course.\nPenny: You ever going to sleep with Amy?\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s awfully personal.\nLeonard: We don\xe2\x80\x99t ask Sheldon things like that.\nPenny: Maybe you don\xe2\x80\x99t, I do. What\xe2\x80\x99s the deal?\nSheldon: Well, word around the university is I\xe2\x80\x99m giving her sex organs a proper jostling.\nPenny: All right, come on, be serious. Look, you guys have been going out a long time. She would clearly like to have a physical relationship with you, so what are you doing?\nLeonard: All right, we\xe2\x80\x99re down the rabbit hole. What are you doing?\nSheldon: Well, first of all, I\xe2\x80\x99m quite fond of Amy.\nPenny: Then what\xe2\x80\x99s the problem?\nSheldon: Penny, all my life, I have been uncomfortable with the sort of physical contact that comes easily to others, hand-shaking, hugging, prostate exams. But I\xe2\x80\x99m working on it, you know? Just recently, I had to put VapoRub on Amy\xe2\x80\x99s chest. A year ago, that would have been unthinkable.\nLeonard: Now you know how I feel when I have to put it on you.\nPenny: Okay. Hang on. Are you saying someday you and Amy might actually get physical?\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s a possibility.\nPenny (under breath while hitting Leonard): Oh, my God! (Out loud) Sheldon, I know this wasn\xe2\x80\x99t easy for you, and I\xe2\x80\x99m really glad we could have this conversation.\nSheldon: Fine.\nPenny (under breath while hitting Leonard): Oh, my God!\nLeonard: Ow!\nScene: The cafeteria.\nRaj: Are you sure you want to do this? Give up your half of the 3-D printer?\nHoward: Yes. And can you please make that out to Bernadette? I was taken off the joint account until I learn the value of money.\nRaj: Wow, that\xe2\x80\x99s harsh.\nHoward: Tell me about it.\nRaj: Aren\xe2\x80\x99t you gonna eat lunch?\nHoward: Nah, I blew my food allowance on Pokemon cards.\nScene: Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s office.\nSheldon: Well, the equation balances, but it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly not elegant.\nKripke: Whatever. You get any wast night?\nSheldon: Yes.\nKripke: Gave it to her good, huh?\nSheldon: No, I gave it to her well. Now, over here, I was thinking the turbulence could be reduced if we just put\xe2\x80\xa6\nKripke: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Was she naked, or was she weawing wingewie?\nSheldon: I didn\xe2\x80\x99t notice.\nKripke: How could you not notice?\nSheldon: I was too busy squishing all the desirable parts of her body.\nKripke: Ah, you\xe2\x80\x99re kiwing me, Cooper!\nSheldon: Can we get back to work?\nKripke: Sure, sure, sure. You guys ever use any toys?\nSheldon: Toys? I do have a model rocket next to my bed.\nKripke: A wocket? You\xe2\x80\x99we a fweak! I wove it!\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
