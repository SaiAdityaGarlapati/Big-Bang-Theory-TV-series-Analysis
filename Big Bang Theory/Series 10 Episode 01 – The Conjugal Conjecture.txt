Leonard?\nLeonard: What?\nSheldon: You realize you and I could become brothers.\nLeonard: We\xe2\x80\x99re not gonna be brothers. We\xe2\x80\x99re not gonna be stepbrothers. Go to sleep.\nSheldon: I hope you\xe2\x80\x99re right. \xe2\x80\x98Cause a grown man living with his brother and his brother\xe2\x80\x99s wife is weird.\nLeonard: Go to sleep.\nSheldon: Okay. Do you think your father\xe2\x80\x99s doing unspeakable things to my mother?\nLeonard: No.\nSheldon: Are you saying that because the things are unspeakable?\nPenny: Your parents are old. Anything unspeakable was finished by 9:30. Go to sleep.\nSheldon: Very well.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry if this stuff is gonna make the ceremony awkward.\nPenny: God, I thought my brother fresh out of jail was gonna make everyone uncomfortable, but now this.\nSheldon: Hey, if you want me to sleep you\xe2\x80\x99re gonna have to stop talking.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The apartment.\nPenny: Okay, I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna go pick up my family. Like an hour and half, two hours, depending on traffic.\nLeonard: Yeah, drive safe.\nPenny: Oh, hey, and do yourself a favour, all right? When Beverly gets here, do not bring up last night. All right? As far as you\xe2\x80\x99re concerned, you don\xe2\x80\x99t know anything, you didn\xe2\x80\x99t see anything. I want you just to play dumb.\nSheldon: It was nice of her to show us playing dumb with an example.\nPenny: What? Oh. Hi. Okay, hey there, I got, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, I got to go now.\nBeverley: Penny, wait.\nPenny: Why?\nBeverley: I wanted to thank you for going through all the trouble of planning a second wedding ceremony for me, but unfortunately I cannot attend.\nLeonard: Well, why? What\xe2\x80\x99s wrong?\nSheldon: Whuh, are we still doing the dumb thing? Okay, why, what\xe2\x80\x99s wrong?\nBeverley: I just cannot stay here while your father goes out of his way to humiliate me.\nSheldon: Oh, golly, however did he humiliate you?\nBeverley: Stop it, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Do I say stop what, or just throw in the towel?\nBeverley: I don\xe2\x80\x99t see why I should have to watch your father parade around with some bible-thumping bumpkin.\nSheldon: Oh, excuse me, that is my mother you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about, however accurately.\nPenny: Okay, Beverley, aren\xe2\x80\x99t you overreacting a little? All we know is they shared a cab and had a nightcap.\nSheldon: And turned their phones off.\nLeonard: Not helping, buddy. Mother, Penny and I really want you to be part of this. Please stay.\nPenny: Yeah, plus if you leave, Alfred will know he got under your skin.\nBeverley: Well, we can\xe2\x80\x99t have that.\nSheldon: You know, also, if they did have coitus, we\xe2\x80\x99ll all be needing a skilled psychiatrist.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s kitchen.\nRaj: It is funny when you think about it.\nHoward: Maybe to you. You didn\xe2\x80\x99t get a $500 traffic ticket.\nBernadette: Because you were driving like a lunatic.\nHoward: Hey, if thinking secret government agents are chasing you makes you a lunatic, then, yeah, okay.\nRaj (doorbell rings): Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99ll get it.\nBernadette: It didn\xe2\x80\x99t help that you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t walk a straight line when the cop pulled you over.\nHoward: I have performance anxiety. You of all people should know that.\nRaj: Hello.\nAir Force Officer: I\xe2\x80\x99m looking for Howard Wolowitz.\nRaj: Howard Wolowitz?\nAir Force Officer: I have the right address, don\xe2\x80\x99t I?\nRaj: Address?\nAir Force Officer: Is he here?\nRaj: Um, no.\nAir Force Officer: Do you know where I can find him?\nRaj: May I ask what this is about?\nAir Force Officer: No, you may not.\nRaj: Very well.\nAir Force Officer: Have him call me.\nRaj: Okay.\nHoward (off): Raj, who\xe2\x80\x99s at the door?\nRaj: That\xe2\x80\x99s not him.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s car.\nPenny: Oh, I can\xe2\x80\x99t wait for you to meet everyone. I told them all about you.\nSusan (Penny\xe2\x80\x99s mother): Like what? Do they know about your brother?\nPenny: Uh, not everything, just, like, the jail and drugs part.\nSusan: Why would you do that?\nPenny: What?\nSusan: The world doesn\xe2\x80\x99t need to know our problems.\nPenny: Well, Mom, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, but\xe2\x80\xa6\nWyatt (Penny\xe2\x80\x99s father): Hey, look, they got Walgreens here, too.\nSusan: You really think it\xe2\x80\x99s helpful to change the subject, Wyatt?\nWyatt: Just trying to make this a happy trip, dear.\nSusan: Well, quit it.\nPenny: So, uh, Randall, can\xe2\x80\x99t believe after all these years you finally get to visit me in California.\nRandall (Penny\xe2\x80\x99s brother): Well, good thing I was a non-violent offender, otherwise I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have left the state.\nSusan: All right, that\xe2\x80\x99s enough jail talk.\nRandall: Penny knows where I was, she sent me cigarettes.\nSusan: You sent your brother cigarettes?\nWyatt: He was cooking and selling crystal meth, Susan, I think we can let the cigarettes slide.\nSusan: Stop trying to be the cool dad, you have a shirt with our cat\xe2\x80\x99s picture on it.\nWyatt: Anyway, we\xe2\x80\x99re here, slugger.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s kitchen.\nHoward: That\xe2\x80\x99s great, now they know where I live.\nRaj: What are you talking about? They\xe2\x80\x99ve always known where you live.\nBernadette: Yeah, if you want to go off the grid, you have to move out of your mother\xe2\x80\x99s house.\nRaj: Can we take a moment to discuss that I just lied to the government for you?\nHoward: Yeah. I would not have done that for you.\nBernadette: Howard, please just call the man, see what he wants.\nHoward: All right, all right.\nRaj: Hey, make sure you tell him that you weren\xe2\x80\x99t home when he came by and that your Indian friend gave you the message the moment you stepped through the door.\nHoward: Yes, hello. Uh, this is Howard Wolowitz for Colonel Richard Williams.\nRaj: Oh, I take it back, don\xe2\x80\x99t mention me.\nHoward: Hi, Colonel Williams, how can I help you? What? Oh, uh, yes, he is from India. No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know his immigration status. Relax, I\xe2\x80\x99m still on hold. Speaking. Okay, sure, I can meet with you on Thursday. Caltech is fine. Yeah, and may I ask what this is about? I may not?\nRaj: That\xe2\x80\x99s what he said to me.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: Here you are, Mother.\nBeverley: Thank you.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m glad you decided to stay. It\xe2\x80\x99s gonna be special for Penny and me to share this with you.\nBeverley: I can\xe2\x80\x99t wait for this day to be over.\nLeonard: Yeah, special, like that. (Knock on door) That\xe2\x80\x99s them. Please don\xe2\x80\x99t make things any more awkward than they already are.\nSheldon: All right, so less or equally awkward, got it.\nLeonard: Hey, guys, come on in.\nAlfred: Oh, thank you.\nMary: Good morning.\nBeverley: Morning.\nSheldon: Hello.\nAlfred: How is everyone today?\nBeverley: Good, and you?\nAlfred: Good, good.\nBeverley: Good.\nMary: I\xe2\x80\x99m good, too.\nBeverley: Good.\nSheldon: So, did you defile my mother or not?\nMary: Sheldon. You\xe2\x80\x99re being rude.\nAlfred: If I may, I can assure you, your mother and I did nothing more than share a cab and a conversation.\nSheldon: Did that conversation include the phrase your genitals are a joy to behold?\nMary: That\xe2\x80\x99s enough.\nAlfred: Look, I promise you, neither I, nor anyone, has ever said that.\nLeonard: You don\xe2\x80\x99t know his girlfriend very well.\nSheldon: Or what a joy it is to behold my genitals.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nPenny: All right, you guys, uh, get settled in, then we\xe2\x80\x99ll go across the hall and say hi to everyone.\nRandall: You know, It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to believe I\xe2\x80\x99ve never met Leonard.\nWyatt: Well, he probably buys his illegal drugs from a local vendor.\nSusan: Not funny, Wyatt.\nPenny: I thought it was really funny.\nWyatt: Thanks.\nSusan: Well, fine, if everyone wants to make jokes about our problems, then I can, too. Knock, knock. Who\xe2\x80\x99s there? Our family is an embarrassment.\nRandall: That\xe2\x80\x99s not much of a joke.\nPenny: Okay. Listen, Mom, I know you\xe2\x80\x99re nervous, but I promise you, no one is gonna judge you or this family.\nSusan: Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. It\xe2\x80\x99s just we\xe2\x80\x99re meeting Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s parents for the first time, and, and they\xe2\x80\x99re academics and, and intellectuals, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t want them thinking we\xe2\x80\x99re white trash.\nRandall: Well, what colour trash do you think they\xe2\x80\x99ll believe?\nScene: The apartment.\nMary: How could you think that I would spend the night with a man I just met?\nSheldon: A man named Jesus convinced you to build a church in Africa. You\xe2\x80\x99re kind of a sucker.\nLeonard: Well, nothing happened, right? It\xe2\x80\x99s over. Until we get married a third time, you guys will never have to see each other again.\nAlfred: Well, you know, actually that\xe2\x80\x99s not the case. Mary may visit me in New York.\nMary: Mm-hmm. And he\xe2\x80\x99s never been to Texas.\nAlfred: Maybe we meet halfway.\nSheldon: What? In the Chattahoochee National Forest in Georgia? I can\xe2\x80\x99t be the only one that knows that\xe2\x80\x99s halfway.\nBeverley: You\xe2\x80\x99re not seriously going to visit each other.\nAlfred: And why wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t we?\nBeverley: Oh please, you\xe2\x80\x99re just saying this to antagonize me.\nAlfred: Oh, not at all. Mary happens to be a wonderful woman. And if it antagonizes you, that\xe2\x80\x99s just a bonus.\nLeonard: Mary, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry you\xe2\x80\x99re in the middle of this.\nMary: No, no, nothing to be sorry about. I genuinely like your father.\nSheldon: What? But he\xe2\x80\x99s a mediocre academic. And according to Beverley, his sexual prowess is sub-par. He\xe2\x80\x99s basically Leonard with a bigger prostate.\nLeonard: Are you saying that my dad\xe2\x80\x99s not good enough for your mom?\nSheldon: Yes, while also getting in a solid dig at you. Pretty efficient, huh?\nLeonard: This is ridiculous. I\xe2\x80\x99m going across the hall.\nSheldon: But why should you get to go and leave me here with your bickering parents?\nLeonard: Fine, then you go.\nMary: Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to stay here with her. I\xe2\x80\x99ll go.\nAlfred: I\xe2\x80\x99ll go with you.\nLeonard: That still leaves me here with him.\nSheldon: Hang on, hang on. We\xe2\x80\x99re smart, we can figure this out. Okay, so: Mary and Beverley can\xe2\x80\x99t be together. Uh, Alfred and Beverley can\xe2\x80\x99t be together. Leonard and I can\xe2\x80\x99t be together. Now, I could be with Alfred but I don\xe2\x80\x99t like his face. Oh, here. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got it.\nAmy: Who\xe2\x80\x99s ready for a wedding?\nSheldon: Great, now I have to start all over.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nWyatt: So how\xe2\x80\x99s the world of pharmaceuticals treating you?\nPenny: Pretty good. I actually just got assigned a much better territory.\nSusan: See what happens when you work hard?\nRandall: Hey, she just sells drugs. I had to make \xe2\x80\x99em.\nSusan: Okay, that\xe2\x80\x99s enough. No more drug talk for the rest of this trip.\nWyatt: I\xe2\x80\x99ll drink to that.\nSusan: Haven\xe2\x80\x99t you had enough?\nWyatt: Penny drinks more than I do.\nPenny: Well, I learned from the best.\nWyatt: Aw.\nPenny: Aw.\nSusan: Very nice, Wyatt. And you wonder why this one turned out the way he did.\nRandall: You see what I\xe2\x80\x99ve gotta put up with.\nSusan: What you\xe2\x80\x99ve gotta put up with? Why did you have to go to jail?\nRandall: It\xe2\x80\x99s called getting caught, Mother.\nLeonard: Hello.\nWyatt: Hey, there he is.\nPenny: Hey.\nSusan: Oh, Leonard. It\xe2\x80\x99s so nice to see you again.\nLeonard: Oh, you, too. Hey, everyone, this is my mother, Beverley.\nBeverley: Hello.\nSusan: Hi.\nRandall: We are not white trash.\nScene: The apartment.\nAmy: Are you excited to see your son walk down the aisle?\nAlfred: Yes, I am. I\xe2\x80\x99m just feeling a little guilty about all the trouble I\xe2\x80\x99ve caused.\nMary: Oh, so am I.\nSheldon: You made God sad today, Mom.\nAmy: Sheldon, they haven\xe2\x80\x99t done anything wrong. I think it\xe2\x80\x99s nice they\xe2\x80\x99re hitting it off.\nSheldon: Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s still no reason to rush into anything. I mean, look at us. We took things remarkably slow. You and I, we didn\xe2\x80\x99t even hold hands for two years.\nAmy: It was a lot hotter than it sounds.\nAlfred: You\xe2\x80\x99re a patient young lady.\nSheldon: Hey, hey. She\xe2\x80\x99s mine, take a cold shower, grandpa.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s kitchen.\nHoward: Why wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t that colonel say what the meeting\xe2\x80\x99s about? It has to be bad news.\nRaj: Calm down, okay? Try not to think about it.\nHoward: That\xe2\x80\x99s really stupid advice.\nRaj: You know that hurts my feelings.\nHoward: Calm down, try not to think about it.\nRaj: Okay.\nHoward: Why do I bother talking to you?\nRaj: Oh, come on. What\xe2\x80\x99s the worst that could come of this meeting?\nHoward: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. They take the invention away, and I get nothing?\nRaj: Okay, that\xe2\x80\x99s not so bad. You know what happened to the scientists that worked on the Manhattan Project? The government forced them to move to the desert. They had to live in secret, and when Oppenheimer objected to what they made him do, they destroyed his reputation.\nHoward: What\xe2\x80\x99s the point of that story?\nRaj: I just read a book about Oppenheimer, seemed like a chance to show off. (Howard laughs) There he is, there\xe2\x80\x99s my happy Hebraic homeboy. Yeah, that\xe2\x80\x99s the smile I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna remember when you\xe2\x80\x99re living in the desert and I\xe2\x80\x99m living with your wife.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nBeverley: So, what do you do for a living?\nRandall: Mommy, you want to take this one?\nSusan: Um, Randall\xe2\x80\x99s in between jobs.\nRandall: And court appearances.\nWyatt: It\xe2\x80\x99s nice to meet the woman who raised this fine young man. I\xe2\x80\x99m looking forward to meeting his father.\nBeverley: Prepare to be disappointed.\nLeonard: And he can\xe2\x80\x99t wait to meet you, too. Can I get anyone a drink?\nWyatt: Well, I could use another beer.\nSusan: You\xe2\x80\x99re done. He\xe2\x80\x99s done.\nPenny: Hey. Is everyone getting to know each other?\nRandall: Not at all.\nScene: The wedding ceremony.\nStuart: Nice to see you again, Dr. Hofstadter. I\xe2\x80\x99m, uh, Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s friend, Stuart.\nBeverley: Nice to see you, too.\nStuart: Hi, I\xe2\x80\x99m Stuart.\nAlfred: Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m Alfred. Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s father.\nStuart: Oh. Oh, hi. Uh, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, did you two want to sit together?\nTogether: No.\nStuart: I was wondering why the front row was available.\nBernadette: Okay, I think we\xe2\x80\x99re ready.\nSheldon: Why do people cry at weddings?\nMary: They\xe2\x80\x99re practicing for what\xe2\x80\x99s coming later.\nSusan: Thank you for cleaning yourself up for your sister\xe2\x80\x99s wedding.\nRandall: Thank you for my new teeth.\nWyatt: Welcome to the family, Leonard. Don\xe2\x80\x99t lend your new brother-in-law money.\nBernadette: We\xe2\x80\x99re here today to celebrate love.\nBeverley: Urgh.\nAlfred: Sigh louder, no one heard you.\nStuart: Really, I can move.\nBernadette: Not just Leonard and Penny\xe2\x80\x99s love, but the love we have for them, as well as each other.\nSheldon: Speaking of love, STDs among the elderly are skyrocketing.\nBernadette: Love is patient, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not gonna put up with all the side chatter, so let\xe2\x80\x99s knock it off.\nHoward: At least she\xe2\x80\x99s yelling at someone else for a change.\nBernadette: Howard.\nPenny: Okay, I understand everyone\xe2\x80\x99s a little tense today, so I am just gonna get to the important stuff. Leonard, standing here with you in front of our family and friends is bringing up a lot of feelings. Like what a good idea it was to elope the first time. But also how incredibly happy you make me. Thank you for marrying me. Hopefully for the last time.\nLeonard: Penny, as a scientist, my job is to figure out why things happen. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I\xe2\x80\x99ll ever understand how someone like me could get to be with someone like you. You know, maybe I don\xe2\x80\x99t\nneed to understand it, I just need to be grateful. I love you, Penny.\nPenny: Oh.\nBernadette: Anybody have anything snarky to say about that? Didn\xe2\x80\x99t think so.\nAlfred: I\xe2\x80\x99d like to say something. Beverly, I know that we don\xe2\x80\x99t bring out the best in each other.\nBut something wonderful did come from our relationship. That young man right there.\nBeverley: I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t agree more.\nStuart: That\xe2\x80\x99s beautiful.\nBernadette: Thank you. All right, let\xe2\x80\x99s continue.\nSheldon: Yeah, excuse me, I need to say something to someone pretty special, and I just can\xe2\x80\x99t wait any longer.\nAmy: It\xe2\x80\x99s happening.\nSheldon: Leonard, you and I have our ups and downs. But I have always considered you my family. Even before the recent threat of our parents fornicating like wrinkly old rabbits. I don\xe2\x80\x99t always show it, but you are of great importance to me. Both of you.\nPenny: Oh.\nLeonard: Thank you.\nBernadette: Okay. I now pronounce you husband and wife. And weird other husband who came with the apartment.\nScene: Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s car.\nBeverley: Thank you for taking us to the airport.\nLeonard: Hey, I\xe2\x80\x99m just thrilled we\xe2\x80\x99re all getting along for a minute.\nAlfred: Yeah, me, too. Beverly, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry if I upset you.\nBeverley: Water under the bridge, Alfred. Leonard, why don\xe2\x80\x99t you get into the carpool lane?\nAlfred: Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s a solid line. He can\xe2\x80\x99t cross that.\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99s okay. I can make it over.\nBeverley: No, no, let\xe2\x80\x99s plod along. It\xe2\x80\x99ll make your father feel more comfortable.\nAlfred: What makes me comfortable is knowing I don\xe2\x80\x99t have to wake up tomorrow morning and see your sour face.\nBeverley: Do the world a favour, and don\xe2\x80\x99t wake up tomorrow morning.\nLeonard: That was almost a minute.\nScene: Amy\xe2\x80\x99s car.\nMary: There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of traffic. Are we gonna be okay?\nAmy: You\xe2\x80\x99ll be at the airport an hour before your flight.\nMary: Good. Thank you.\nSheldon: Plenty of time for you to meet another geriatric boy toy.\nMary: Hey. I will not have you be disrespectful to me.\nSheldon: Yes ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\nAmy: Sheldon, you\xe2\x80\x99re mother\xe2\x80\x99s an attractive woman. You need to get use to the fact that men are going to be interested in her.\nSheldon: Well, and you need to drive the car and mind your business.\nAmy: I will not have you be disrespectful to me.\nSheldon: What, you\xe2\x80\x99re not my mother.\nMary: Don\xe2\x80\x99t you be disrespectful to her.\nSheldon: Yes ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\nMary: You\xe2\x80\x99ll get there. You\xe2\x80\x99ve just gotta put some zing on it.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s car.\nSusan: Penny, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what I was worried about. You\xe2\x80\x99re friends are just lovely.\nPenny: Oh, thanks, Mom.\nSusan: Although that Sheldon is a bit peculiar.\nPenny: Is he? I never noticed.\nWyatt: He reminds me of that turkey we had who drowned looking up at the rain.\nRandall: Cops, cops, be cool.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
