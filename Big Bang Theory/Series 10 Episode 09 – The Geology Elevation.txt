b'Scene: The cafeteria.\nBert: Thank you very much. Thanks.\nLeonard: That is unbelievable. Good for Bert.\nHoward: Damn, the MacArthur Genius Grant.\nRaj: Couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have happened to a nicer guy.\nSheldon: Everything is stupid and I want to go home.\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99s Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s way of saying he\xe2\x80\x99s proud of Bert, too.\nHoward: Ah.\nSheldon: Hey, it\xe2\x80\x99s not even called the Genius Grant, it\xe2\x80\x99s the MacArthur Fellowship. Just like it\xe2\x80\x99s not Frankenstein, it\xe2\x80\x99s Frankenstein\xe2\x80\x99s Monster. Which brings us back to that hulking simpleton over there. And if anyone\xe2\x80\x99s a genius, it\xe2\x80\x99s me for the way I brought that full circle.\nLeonard: How much money did he win?\nRaj: Over half a million dollars.\nLeonard: Wow.\nHoward: And he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have to use it for research, he can do whatever he wants with it.\nSheldon: Oh, good, maybe he can build a nicer bridge to live under.\nHoward: Here he comes.\nLeonard: Right. Be polite.\nSheldon: I know how to behave.\nHoward: Do you?\nRaj: Hey, congratulations Bert.\nLeonard: Yeah, good for you.\nHoward: That\xe2\x80\x99s amazing.\nBert: Thanks. I was as surprised as anybody. When they called and told me I won, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t believe them. And then they said, no, you really won. And then I said, cool.\nSheldon: Someone call George R. R. Martin, this guy knows how to finish a story.\nBert: I\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten pretty good at telling it. Well, see ya.\nSheldon: Some genius. I zinged him with sarcasm, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t even notice.\nLeonard: I know, and it was the greatest sarcastic quip I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever heard.\nSheldon: Well, aren\xe2\x80\x99t you a peach.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The stairwell.\nSheldon: Who leaves their bike in the hallway? You know, if I knew how to ride one, I\xe2\x80\x99d steal it.\nLeonard: Ignore him, he\xe2\x80\x99s just cranky because Bert from the geology lab won a big grant.\nPenny: Oh, I heard him interviewed on the radio. You know, when they told him he won, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t believe it, but then he did believe it. It was so funny.\nSheldon: Who listens to the radio any more?\nAmy: Bert is studying the way microbes in rocks can survive in extreme environmental conditions.\nLeonard: They say it could be a potential indicator of life on other planets.\nPenny: You know what, I\xe2\x80\x99ve met Bert. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t he an indicator of life on other planets?\nSheldon: You used to make those jokes about me. Now everything is Bert, Bert, Bert.\nAmy: You know, Sheldon, maybe if you take the time to actually read Bert\xe2\x80\x99s research, you\xe2\x80\x99d be less bitter about him winning.\nSheldon: You want me to read a geology paper?\nAmy: Honestly, I just want you to be quiet but I\xe2\x80\x99m all out of taffy.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s kitchen.\nHoward: You busy? There\xe2\x80\x99s somebody out here who wants to meet you.\nBernadette: Who is it?\nHoward: Say hello to everybody\xe2\x80\x99s little friend, remote control Stephen Hawking.\nBernadette: Where did you get that?\nHoward: I found him in an old box.\nBernadette: Why would you buy it?\nHoward: I didn\xe2\x80\x99t buy it. I made it.\nBernadette: Last question. What is wrong with you?\nHoward: What\xe2\x80\x99s the big deal?\nBernadette: Howie, it\xe2\x80\x99s in poor taste.\nHoward: No, it\xe2\x80\x99s not. Check it out, he says fun stuff.\nRemote-control Hawking: Hey good lookin\xe2\x80\x99, want to go for a spin?\nHoward: His eyes also light up in the dark.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s always fun watching him read someone else\xe2\x80\x99s work.\nPenny: It\xe2\x80\x99s like scrolling through the emojis on my phone.\nSheldon: Yeh, why? Eh, why? Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s why.\nAmy: Sounds like the night we had coitus.\nSheldon: I hope you\xe2\x80\x99re happy making me read this. Bert\xe2\x80\x99s work is remarkable, and I\xe2\x80\x99m more upset than ever. This is worse than when I had to admit that Cedric the Entertainer\xe2\x80\x99s actually entertaining.\nAmy: Sheldon, it\xe2\x80\x99s foolish to be angry that Bert\xe2\x80\x99s work has merit.\nSheldon: Yeah, well I am angry. And you telling me not to be angry makes me angry. And do you know how hearing myself say the word angry over and over makes me feel?\nPenny: Ooh, ooh, ooh, angry?\nLeonard: What are you doing?\nPenny: I, I knew the answer. I got excited.\nLeonard: Hey, buddy, why don\xe2\x80\x99t we go for a walk, so you can calm down.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s a good idea. I guess everyone\xe2\x80\x99s having them now.\nLeonard: Hey, I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to help you.\nSheldon: Fine. You can walk ahead of me and scare off the pigeons.\nLeonard: You just wave your arms a little and they fly away, it\xe2\x80\x99s not\xe2\x80\xa6\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s kitchen.\nHoward: Okay, Raj, I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna show you something. Now, one of us thinks it\xe2\x80\x99s offensive, the other thinks it\xe2\x80\x99s hilarious and a great idea. But, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to tell you who likes it.\nRaj: This is tough, but I\xe2\x80\x99m going to say it\xe2\x80\x99s the guy who shows me YouTube videos of people getting hit in the nuts.\nHoward: You\xe2\x80\x99re crazy. I\xe2\x80\x99ve worked with Hawking. He\xe2\x80\x99s got a great sense of humour, and I think he\xe2\x80\x99d like it.\nBernadette: Okay, call him and show him. I dare you.\nHoward: I have no problem calling him.\nBernadette: Fine, then do it.\nHoward: Fine, I will.\nBernadette: While you\xe2\x80\x99re bothering the world\xe2\x80\x99s most famous scientist, be sure to show him how funny he looks getting stuck under our dishwasher.\nRaj: What\xe2\x80\x99s this button do?\nRemote-control Hawking: Gentlemen, start your wheelchairs.\nHoward: You laughed when that guy got hit in the nuts.\nRaj: I laughed because the guy was Leonard.\nScene: The park.\nSheldon: I admire you, Leonard.\nLeonard: Really, why?\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re happy with who you are. You don\xe2\x80\x99t get jealous of other people. Instead of being weighed down by ambition, you just float along like a dead body in a river.\nLeonard: I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t just take the compliment. I had to ask why. You know, I do understand what you\xe2\x80\x99re feeling. My brother and sister\xe2\x80\x99s accomplishments have always been held over my head.\nSheldon: How did you deal with it?\nLeonard: I wet the bed until college, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x99s a quality fix.\nSheldon: I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe I was surpassed by a geologist. I mean, rocks. He studies rocks. If rock is so great, how come paper beats it? Leonard, I\xe2\x80\x99m having a primal urge to throw this rock.\nLeonard: Do it. Visualize it as your anger and, and toss it out of your life.\nSheldon: Perhaps I will. This rock encapsulates all my negative emotions. I will cast you far away. Feel free to take out a pigeon while you\xe2\x80\x99re at it.\nLeonard: Let it fly.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow\xe2\x80\xa6\nAmy: What happened?\nSheldon: I tried to let go of anger and threw a rock into my foot.\nLeonard: Then he got more angry and kicked the rock with his other foot.\nPenny: Well, and what happened to you?\nLeonard: Oh, I laughed so hard, I burst a blood vessel in my nose. It\xe2\x80\x99s fine.\nAmy: You know, it\xe2\x80\x99s one thing to be envious, but now you\xe2\x80\x99re injuring yourself. It has to stop.\nLeonard: Although if you are gonna do it again, please let me know, so I can get it on video.\nAmy: You know, Sheldon, instead of fixating on what Bert has, you should appreciate all of the good things in your life. You\xe2\x80\x99ve got love, you\xe2\x80\x99re in good health, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got a roof over your head.\nSheldon: Yeah, but you\xe2\x80\x99ve got all those things, and no one\xe2\x80\x99s lining up to be you.\nAmy: Anybody else want to try? I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna go make some more tea and question my life choices.\nLeonard: You\xe2\x80\x99re up.\nPenny: This is getting old fast, Dolores, knock it off.\nSheldon: Uh, do you really think calling me names is helpful?\nPenny: I do, your life is fine you big baby.\nSheldon: Maybe you\xe2\x80\x99re right.\nAmy: Really?\nLeonard: If it helps, I\xe2\x80\x99m questioning your life choices, too.\nSheldon: Thank you, Penny. You know, I just need to keep reminding myself that Bert\xe2\x80\x99s success is not my failure.\nPenny: There you go.\nSheldon: And that men of his large stature are more susceptible to a wide array of life-threatening diseases.\nPenny: There you go.\nScene: Outside Amy\xe2\x80\x99s lab. Howard knocks on the door.\nAmy: What\xe2\x80\x99s up?\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m conducting a quick survey. Do you think this respectful and loving tribute to a great man is in poor taste?\nAmy: Yep.\nScene: The cafeteria.\nHoward: Do you think this is in poor taste?\nLeonard: Does it spin around and do tricks?\nHoward: Yeah\nLeonard: Then yeah.\nScene: Barry Kripke\xe2\x80\x99s office.\nHoward: What do you think?\nBarry: That is hiwawious. Give me the wemote contwol, I want to dwive him into the girls\xe2\x80\x99 westwoom.\nHoward: All right, we\xe2\x80\x99re done. It\xe2\x80\x99s offensive.\nScene: The cafeteria.\nSheldon: Top of the afternoon, gentlemen.\nHoward: You\xe2\x80\x99re in a good mood.\nSheldon: Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s a new day. I have a new outlook. You know, I realized I don\xe2\x80\x99t need to worry about other people. I just need to think more about myself.\nLeonard: Oh, how will we ever get used to the new you?\nRaj: Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m glad to see you moving forward.\nSheldon: Bert did quality research, and he deserves whatever accolades he receives.\nHoward: What is going on? Did you upgrade his software last night?\nLeonard: I think he might be learning on his own.\nRaj: Then the robot uprising has begun.\nSheldon: Excuse me, I need to pay Bert a proper congratulations.\nRaj: He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t just look like C-3PO, now he walks like him.\nSheldon: Bert? I wanted to let you know that I read your research, and your award is well-deserved.\nBert: Thanks. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been hearing that a lot. Ever since I won, people think I\xe2\x80\x99m great.\nSheldon: Well, just this once, you can count me as people, too.\nBert: You know, as a MacArthur Grant winner, I\xe2\x80\x99m allowed to nominate someone for next year.\nSheldon: Really? I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know that.\nBert: So I was thinking, you know, engineers don\xe2\x80\x99t get a lot of respect. Is your friend Howard working on anything cool?\nSheldon: You know, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure. You know, you\xe2\x80\x99d have to ask him. Excuse me. (Off) Aah. Leonard, I hurt myself again.\nLeonard: Excuse me, I have to go take some pictures.\nScene: The apartment.\nAmy: I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe you head-butted a water fountain.\nSheldon: No, I went to punch the water fountain, slipped in water in front of the water fountain, and hit my head on the water fountain.\nBernadette: I can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine you being violent.\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s not hard. Just picture the Three Stooges, and then take away two stooges.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m so disappointed in myself. Jealousy is completely illogical.\nRaj: It\xe2\x80\x99s a human emotion, Sheldon. Everyone gets jealous. I\xe2\x80\x99m jealous of Leonard and Penny and Howard and Bernadette for being in such happy relationships.\nAmy: What about me and Sheldon?\nRaj: Sure.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99ve always been jealous of how much money Raj\xe2\x80\x99s family has.\nRaj: Thank you for saying that. Next to buying things, that is the best part about having money.\nAmy: Ever since I met Penny, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been envious of her looks.\nPenny: Aw, thank you.\nAmy: That\xe2\x80\x99s why I was so happy when you cut your hair off.\nPenny: What?\nAmy: You know what I mean. You were still hot, but more like a why\xe2\x80\x99d that hot girl cut off all her hair, hot.\nPenny: You liked my short hair, right?\nLeonard: Yeah. I loved it. Love you, love the hair, would love to change the subject.\nPenny: Seriously, none of you liked it?\nBernadette: I thought it was brave. Does that count as liking it?\nPenny: You know, how come nobody\xe2\x80\x99s talking about Howard\xe2\x80\x99s dopey haircut?\nBernadette: I think he looks cute.\nHoward: And I think you\xe2\x80\x99re cute.\nRaj: I think you\xe2\x80\x99re both cute.\nPenny: I think I hate all of you nerds.\nScene: A corridor at the university.\nSheldon: Sorry I\xe2\x80\x99m moving slowly.\nLeonard: Oh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind. If you pull a butterscotch out of your pocket, it would be like I\xe2\x80\x99m walking with my grandma.\nSheldon: Oh, no. A plaque? Nobody wants to see this.\nLeonard: Well, change plaque to mixed-race couple and you are my grandma.\nSheldon: I can\xe2\x80\x99t take this any more. (Knock, knock, knock) Bert. (Knock, knock, knock) Bert. (Knock, knock, knock) Bert.\nBert: Come in.\nSheldon: All right, let\xe2\x80\x99s do this, Bert? We need to talk.\nBert: What happened to you?\nSheldon: Rock, rock, water fountain. I am not proud of this, but I have been envious of your recent success.\nBert: Wow, I won the MacArthur Grant, everyone\xe2\x80\x99s jealous of me. Once I get Lasik, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be out of things to wish for.\nSheldon: I was hoping by admitting my weakness to you, I\xe2\x80\x99d somehow be unburdened.\nBert: Is it working?\nSheldon: No. Now that you know my weakness, I hate you more than ever.\nBert: Well, you know, we\xe2\x80\x99re both pretty smart. I bet if we put our heads together, we could come up with a solution.\nSheldon: We, hang on, you\xe2\x80\x99re my enemy. Now, the enemy of the enemy is my friend. And right now, I\xe2\x80\x99m my own worst enemy. That makes you my friend. Okay, I\xe2\x80\x99m good to go.\nBert: Great. Now that we\xe2\x80\x99re friends, want to see if we can get tickets to a taping of Ellen?\nSheldon: You know what? This isn\xe2\x80\x99t gonna work.\nBert: Sheldon, wait. You know, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got a lot to be happy about. You\xe2\x80\x99re at the top of your field, you have a great girlfriend.\nSheldon: Yes, that\xe2\x80\x99s right. I have Amy. In the past, you\xe2\x80\x99ve professed feelings for her. Does it eat you up inside that I have her and you don\xe2\x80\x99t?\nBert: It used to. But now that I\xe2\x80\x99m rich and successful, I think I can do better.\nScene: The apartment.\nPenny: I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe you punched Bert.\nSheldon: I didn\xe2\x80\x99t punch him. He turned around, and I gave him a Captain Kirk karate chop. I\xe2\x80\x99m not even sure he knows I did it.\nLeonard: Hey, Sheldon, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got someone here who might make you feel better.\nStephen Hawking (on skype): Hello, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Professor Hawking.\nHawking: I understand you\xe2\x80\x99re struggling with professional jealousy.\nSheldon: Thanks, Leonard, now he\xe2\x80\x99s not gonna think I\xe2\x80\x99m cool.\nHawking: Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry, I know how you feel. I have never won a Nobel Prize.\nPenny: Oh, wow, that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem fair.\nHawking: It\xe2\x80\x99s fine. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been on The Simpsons.\nSheldon: How do you deal with the success of your colleagues?\nHawking: I remind myself every scientific advancement is a victory. Also, I was on Star Trek.\nLeonard: Oh, it was a good one. He played poker with Sir Isaac, you don\xe2\x80\x99t care.\nHawking: Don\xe2\x80\x99t waste your time on jealousy Sheldon, you\xe2\x80\x99re too brilliant.\nAmy: How can you feel bad if Stephen Hawking says you\xe2\x80\x99re brilliant?\nSheldon: I can\xe2\x80\x99t. Thank you, Professor Hawking. You are a gift to mankind. There should be statues of you everywhere. You know, the Lincoln Memorial has a big chair. We could swap you right in.\nHawking: I always thought a motorized toy of me would be cool.\nSheldon: What a wonderful idea, how does this man not have a Nobel?\nLeonard: Do not tell Wolowitz.\nAmy: Way ahead of you.\nScene: The Ellen Show.\nEllen: A new study came out, and it said that laughing makes your brain work better. And I know that\xe2\x80\x99s true because laughing has made me the smartiest. Although, on the other hand, babies laugh a lot, and they\xe2\x80\x99re dumb.\nSheldon: Do people know about her? \xe2\x80\x98Cause she\xe2\x80\x99s delightful.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
