b'Scene: The apartment.\nPenny: Hey, how are things going with your parents?\nRaj; Not great. They hired divorce attorneys.\nSheldon: You know, speaking of attorneys, if I ever needed a lawyer, I would not hire She-Hulk.\nPenny: You know what? That was almost on topic. I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna say good job, Sheldon.\nAmy: Wait, She-Hulk\xe2\x80\x99s a lawyer?\nHoward: Yeah, she works at a law firm in New York.\nSheldon: Yes, but she\xe2\x80\x99s the only monster at the firm. Between you, me and the wall, I think she\xe2\x80\x99s an affirmative action hire.\nRaj: Anyway, Dad\xe2\x80\x99s gonna be here in town, so I won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to do Christmas dinner this year.\nAmy: If you\xe2\x80\x99re not up to hosting Christmas dinner, I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to do it. You can even bring your father.\nRaj: That would be nice.\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99ve always wanted to do a traditional Victorian Christmas. Parlour games, goose and figgy pudding.\nSheldon: Ugh. English pudding. You get yourself all excited for pudding, and here comes a cake with raisins in it. I\xe2\x80\x99m not going.\nAmy: You\xe2\x80\x99re going.\nSheldon: Why do you hate me?\nAmy: I don\xe2\x80\x99t hate you. I love you.\nSheldon: Well, you call it love, but it has a lot of raisins in it.\nRaj: Amy, good luck getting these guys excited about a dinner with a theme. I gave up when no one cared about my Tom Hanks-giving.\nBernadette: I think a Victorian Christmas sounds nice.\nHoward: I agree.\nLeonard: Why not?\nPenny: Me, too.\nRaj: You guys suck.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The University clean room.\nLeonard: You know the best part of working in the clean room? No allergies. Check it out. Oh, that, that, that\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of oxygen.\nHoward: We should get going to Amy\xe2\x80\x99s.\nLeonard: Can you believe there was a time when we would have needed an array of giant Cherenkov telescopes to detect cosmic particles? And here we are building our own multi-wire detector like a couple of badasses.\nHoward: I know. If we were still single, we\xe2\x80\x99d be tripping over all that booty.\nLeonard: Ladies do love a man dressed like a kitchen garbage bag. Oh, no.\nHoward: How the hell did a pigeon get in here?\nLeonard: You shut the loading doors, right?\nHoward: I thought you did.\nLeonard: Do you know what a disaster this is?\nHoward: You mean \xe2\x80\x99cause this room isn\xe2\x80\x99t supposed to have dust in it, and we just let in a flying crap machine?\nLeonard: What do we do? Should we call someone?\nHoward: And tell them that we compromised all the equipment? Let\xe2\x80\x99s just get it out of here before anyone knows.\nLeonard: Okay, how do we catch it?\nHoward: Well, what if we turn off all the lights except for one, and it\xe2\x80\x99ll come to it.\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s not a moth.\nHoward: Don\xe2\x80\x99t yell at me. You\xe2\x80\x99re not gonna get any good ideas out of me if you\xe2\x80\x99re yelling.\nLeonard: Okay, so if I remain calm, I\xe2\x80\x99ll get more gems like turn off the lights?\nHoward: Great, we\xe2\x80\x99re turning on each other. That\xe2\x80\x99s just what the bird wants us to do.\nScene: Amy\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nPenny: So, Dr. Koothrappali, long flight?\nDr Koothrappali: Twenty hours.\nPenny: Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s rough.\nDr Koothrappali: Not at all. Did you know that when you fly transcontinental without your wife, you don\xe2\x80\x99t pray for the plane to crash?\nRaj: Can we please talk about anything else?\nDr Koothrappali: Forgive me. How are you and Leonard?\nPenny: Oh, great. Everything\xe2\x80\x99s good.\nDr Koothrappali: I see you got engaged.\nPenny: Yes, we did.\nDr Koothrappali: Let me tell you a story.\nRaj: Dad.\nDr Koothrappali: Sorry. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you won\xe2\x80\x99t grow to hate each other.\nRaj (on phone): Hey, Leonard. What\xe2\x80\x99s up? What? How did that happen? Yeah, okay. I\xe2\x80\x99ll be there as soon as I can. Sorry. I have to run to the university.\nAmy: What\xe2\x80\x99s going on?\nRaj: There\xe2\x80\x99s been a problem with an experiment. A bird got into the clean room.\nDr Koothrappali: You want me to come?\nRaj: Uh, no. You had a long flight. You stay here and relax.\nDr Koothrappali: Relax. Easy for you to say. Your mother isn\xe2\x80\x99t cleaning out your bank account. Forty years, the woman never cleaned a thing.\nPenny: You\xe2\x80\x99re just gonna leave him here?\nDr Koothrappali: Relax, he says.\nRaj: Yup. Bye.\nScene: Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s car.\nBernadette (singing): Here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus, right down Santa Claus Lane. Vixen and Blitzen and all his reindeer pulling on the reins.\nSheldon: Yeah, I appreciate the ride.\nBernadette (singing): Bells are ringing, children singing, all is merry and bright. So hang your stockings and say your prayers \xe2\x80\x99cause Santa Claus is coming tonight. Why\xe2\x80\x99d you turn it off?\nSheldon: Because in the last ten minutes, Santa came to town, kissed Mommy and ran Grandma over with a reindeer. I had a drunk uncle who did all those things. Nobody sings songs about him.\nBernadette: Maybe you\xe2\x80\x99d like it more if you thought of Santa as a superhero and his power is bringing joy to children.\nSheldon: My uncle was accused of that, too. It turned out to be legal in Oklahoma.\nBernadette: Okay, new subject. Let\xe2\x80\x99s talk about presents. What did you get Amy?\nSheldon: Oh, we\xe2\x80\x99re not exchanging gifts.\nBernadette: Come on, Sheldon, you have to get her something.\nSheldon: Why should I? She knows that I don\xe2\x80\x99t like Christmas, and yet, every year, she forces me to celebrate it. Not only am I going to this foolish dinner against my will, at the Christmas tree lot, there was mistletoe, and she kissed me under it in public. Like we were the stars of a Tijuana sex show.\nBernadette: She\xe2\x80\x99s just excited about the holidays.\nSheldon: Yes, and she\xe2\x80\x99s not taking my feelings into account at all. Maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s time I teach her a lesson.\nBernadette: How?\nSheldon: Hmm. It\xe2\x80\x99d have to be something heinous, something that makes her as miserable as she\xe2\x80\x99s making me. Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got it. This is good.\nBernadette: What?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m going to buy her a present.\nBernadette: Yeah, you\xe2\x80\x99re gonna have to walk me through that.\nSheldon: With gift-giving, there\xe2\x80\x99s an implied social contract. If I show up tonight with a present, and she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have one for me, she\xe2\x80\x99ll feel terrible.\nBernadette: Then you\xe2\x80\x99re both sad?\nSheldon: Yes. Maybe she\xe2\x80\x99ll feel so guilty, she\xe2\x80\x99ll never make me celebrate the holidays again.\nBernadette: So your evil plot here is to buy your girlfriend a present?\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s right. So stay on my good side, or I\xe2\x80\x99ll get you a little something, too.\nScene: The clean room.\nHoward: Okay, here\xe2\x80\x99s the plan. I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna put the food in the bag, and when he lands in the bag to eat it, we close it up.\nLeonard: A Slim Jim?\nHoward: It\xe2\x80\x99s all I could find. It\xe2\x80\x99ll work.\nLeonard: Sure. If the pigeon\xe2\x80\x99s stoned or a trucker.\nHoward: Okay, well, what\xe2\x80\x99s your plan?\nLeonard: I told you my plan. Let\xe2\x80\x99s call Building Services and get help.\nHoward: And admit that we contaminated the clean room?\nLeonard: No, admit that you contaminated the clean room.\nHoward: Why do you keep assuming it was me?\nLeonard: Because you do this kind of thing all the time, and then you try to cover it up.\nHoward: Like when?\nLeonard: What about when you flipped the Mars Rover, or lost Koothrappali\xe2\x80\x99s dog, or almost drove off with that baby?\nHoward: Again, it looked like my car, and the baby didn\xe2\x80\x99t even cry until his mother punched me with her keys.\nLeonard: Fine, put the Slim Jim in the garbage bag.\nHoward: Well, what if you said it without sounding so condescending?\nLeonard: I can try, but your plan has the words garbage bag and Slim Jim in it.\nRaj: Hey, what\xe2\x80\x99s going on?\nLeonard: Oh. Genius here wants to catch a bird with a garbage bag and a Slim Jim.\nRaj: Should have put it in the bag first.\nScene: Amy\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nPenny: So, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind me asking, do you think you might start dating again?\nDr Koothrappali: It\xe2\x80\x99s much too soon for that. Why? Do you know someone?\nPenny: No, but if things don\xe2\x80\x99t work out with me and Leonard, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you a call. Wait. How much do you talk about Star Trek?\nAmy: Okay, let\xe2\x80\x99s get this Victorian party started. I\xe2\x80\x99ve done some research about some traditional parlour games we can play.\nPenny: Like what?\nAmy: Well, there\xe2\x80\x99s a fun one called Ball of Wool. You take a ball of wool, and you put it right in the centre of the table. Then people sit on opposite sides of the table and try to blow the wool off.\nPenny: Sorry. She\xe2\x80\x99s taken, too.\nScene: The clean room.\nHoward: You know what I think your problem is? You\xe2\x80\x99re jealous because you and I used to be best friends until Koothrappali came along.\nLeonard: And you found somebody you could push around?\nRaj: Hey.\nHoward: Stay out of this.\nRaj: Okay.\nHoward: You know, maybe I\xe2\x80\x99m best friends with Raj because he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t think he\xe2\x80\x99s smarter than me.\nRaj: Actually.\nHoward: I said, stay out of it.\nLeonard: No, no, no. No, Raj, go ahead, say what you were gonna say.\nRaj: All I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna say is you guys need to stop this right now. It. it\xe2\x80\x99s bad enough that my parents are fighting, now I have to hear the two of you? And who cares who\xe2\x80\x99s smarter? If it\xe2\x80\x99s Leonard or me or, you know, it\xe2\x80\x99s Christmas, let\xe2\x80\x99s say it\xe2\x80\x99s Howard.\nHoward: Well, if you\xe2\x80\x99re so smart, you get the bird out.\nRaj: No, you\xe2\x80\x99re the one who let him in.\nHoward: How do you know it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t Leonard?\nRaj: Come on.\nScene: A shopping mall.\nBernadette: What about that sweater?\nSheldon: No, it\xe2\x80\x99s not good enough. It has to be perfect.\nBernadette: I think the nicest gifts I\xe2\x80\x99ve got from Howie show how well he knows me.\nSheldon: Hmm. Let\xe2\x80\x99s see, what do I know about Amy? She loves medieval literature, Chaucer\xe2\x80\x99s her favourite. And her eyes sparkle when she watches old French movies. I enjoy how harp music causes her fingers to dance as if she\xe2\x80\x99s playing along.\nBernadette: Wow, you really do love her.\nSheldon: I do. Now, let\xe2\x80\x99s find the kind of gift that makes her feel small and worthless.\nScene: Amy\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nAmy: You won.\nPenny: Certainly doesn\xe2\x80\x99t feel like it, does it?\nDr Koothrappali: You know, my wife used to throw theme parties like this all the time.\nPenny: Oh, I guess that\xe2\x80\x99s where Raj gets it from.\nDr Koothrappali: Well, he and his mother spent a lot of time together when he was young. I was always working.\nPenny: Hey, you know, Raj is dating a doctor who works a lot. Him and his mom have a type. You, you got to laugh at that, right? No? All right.\nScene: Santa\xe2\x80\x99s grotto.\nSanta: All right, let me see if I\xe2\x80\x99ve got this straight. A picture of you on my lap is a way to punish your girlfriend for making you celebrate Christmas?\nSheldon: Correct.\nSanta: Santa thinks dating you may be punishment enough.\nSheldon: There\xe2\x80\x99s an argument for that. But I want to make sure.\nPhotographer: Smile.\nSanta: Ho, ho. ho.\nScene: The clean room.\nLeonard: Okay. On the count of three, I\xe2\x80\x99ll shoot the fire extinguisher and get him airborne. Howard, you wave the blanket and guide him towards the exit. Raj, you hold open the curtain so he can fly out.\nHoward: Are you sure a dummy like me can handle something as complicated as a blanket?\nLeonard: Do you want the fire extinguisher?\nHoward: Yeah, I do.\nLeonard: Great. Here you go.\nHoward: Okay. One, two, three.\nRaj: Uh, you have to take the pin out.\nLeonard: You miss the blanket now, don\xe2\x80\x99t you?\nHoward: On three. One, two, three.\nRaj: What did you do?\nHoward: It was an accident. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.\nLeonard: Relax, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t your fault.\nHoward: Uh, maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s just stunned.\nRaj: Dude, it\xe2\x80\x99s not breathing.\nHoward: Oh, no. I killed it. Oh, not again.\nRaj: What do you mean, not again?\nHoward: When I was ten, I was playing in my backyard and sat on a blue jay. I mean, I tried to bring it back to life with electricity, but it just caught on fire. The worst part was it smelled delicious.\nLeonard: Uh, guys, I found an article here that says you can do CPR on birds.\nHoward: Great. Do it.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m not doing it. You killed him, you do it.\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99ll do it.\nHoward: No. I need to do it. This is on me.\nLeonard: Okay. Mouth over beak and light chest compressions.\nRaj: Don\xe2\x80\x99t blow too hard. If you pop him, I will vomit.\nLeonard: Anything?\nHoward: I am tasting a lot of Slim Jim.\nLeonard: Wait, wait, his wing moved.\nHoward: Oh, he blinked his eyes. He\xe2\x80\x99s alive.\nRaj: It\xe2\x80\x99s a Christmas miracle.\nHoward: I might argue a Hanukkah miracle, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll take it. Come on, little guy, let\xe2\x80\x99s get you outside. Get the curtain.\nRaj: Someone should really close that loading door.\nScene: The same, later.\nRaj: Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s that. The room\xe2\x80\x99s compromised. They\xe2\x80\x99ll have to change all the filters, probably shut it down for weeks.\nHoward: You were right. Go ahead, call Building Services. Tell them it was my fault.\nLeonard: No, we\xe2\x80\x99re both to blame. You know, let me take the heat on this one.\nRaj: Yeah, just leave me out of it. You know if they come here and see crap everywhere, they\xe2\x80\x99re just gonna blame the Indian guy.\nLeonard (on phone): Hey. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, we\xe2\x80\x99re still here. Is everything okay?\nPenny: It\xe2\x80\x99s kind of boring. Although it did get exciting for a minute when Amy inhaled a wool ball. How much longer do you think you\xe2\x80\x99ll be?\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. There\xe2\x80\x99s still a bird in here. We are gonna get in a ton of trouble.\nPenny: Honey, it\xe2\x80\x99s Christmas Eve. Who even knows you\xe2\x80\x99re in there?\nLeonard: No, our names are on the sign-in sheet.\nPenny: So erase them and walk out.\nLeonard: I can\xe2\x80\x99t do that.\nHoward: Can\xe2\x80\x99t do what?\nLeonard: She says take our names off the sign-in sheet and leave.\nHoward: We can\xe2\x80\x99t do that.\nLeonard: Yeah.\nScene: Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s car.\nLeonard, Howard and Raj (singing): Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way. Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh, hey.\nScene: Amy\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nRaj: Mmm. Amy, that pudding was delicious.\nSheldon: If you like raisins.\nAmy: Thank you. And it\xe2\x80\x99s figs.\nSheldon: Oh. Oh, in that case, it was pretty good.\nBernadette: You feeling okay? You hardly touched your goose.\nHoward: It smelled too much like blue jay.\nDr Koothrappali: Can I help you clean up?\nAmy: Oh, you Heimliched a ball of wool out of me; you\xe2\x80\x99re good.\nSheldon: Uh, what do you say we exchange gifts?\nPenny: Oh, Sheldon, we didn\xe2\x80\x99t bring any.\nLeonard: I thought you hate giving gifts.\nSheldon: Yeah, I do. Which is why I got Amy this.\nAmy: You got me something?\nSheldon: Oh, not just something, no. It\xe2\x80\x99s from the heart, it\xe2\x80\x99s holiday-themed, and I swallowed the gift receipt so you cannot return it.\nAmy: Look at you on Santa\xe2\x80\x99s lap. That\xe2\x80\x99s so sweet.\nSheldon: Of course it is. It\xe2\x80\x99s the perfect gift. How are you feeling right now? Guilty? Sad? Wishing you were Jewish?\nAmy: No, I love it.\nSheldon: Oh, really? Well, how about now? (On recording) Happy holidays to my dear Amy. I hope you treasure this as much as I treasure you. (Not on recording) And you got me nothing. Christmas is ruined. Let\xe2\x80\x99s never speak of it again. Well, this was fun.\nAmy: Actually, I did get you something.\nSheldon: But what about our agreement?\nAmy: Well, you got me something. Here.\nSheldon: Cookies?\nAmy: They\xe2\x80\x99re your Meemaw\xe2\x80\x99s Christmas cookies. I called and got the recipe.\nSheldon: They\xe2\x80\x99re perfect. It tastes like her hugs.\nAmy: Merry Christmas, Sheldon.\nSheldon: I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe this. You\xe2\x80\x99re happy, I\xe2\x80\x99m happy. Well, maybe a holiday that\xe2\x80\x99s all about giving isn\xe2\x80\x99t so\xe2\x80\xa6 Get your hand out of that box.\nScene: The same, later.\nAmy: Okay. The next game is called Hot Boiled Beans.\nPenny: Of course it is.\nAmy: One person is sent out of the room while the others hide a small item. Then they invite the first person back by saying hot boiled beans and bacon for supper, hurry up before it gets cold.\nRaj: If you people think this is better than Tom Hanks-giving, you\xe2\x80\x99re all crazy.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
