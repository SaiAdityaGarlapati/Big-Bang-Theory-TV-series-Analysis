b'Scene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Boy, do I have to urinate.\nLeonard: If only there were a solution to that.\nSheldon: Seriously. I feel like I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a fish tank in my pelvis.\nLeonard: So go to the bathroom.\nSheldon: I can\xe2\x80\x99t.\nLeonard: Why not?\nSheldon: Because I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to decide between getting an Xbox One or a PS4. Oh, pee, why\xe2\x80\x99d I say that?\nLeonard: Forgive me for asking a stupid question, but why are you being stupid?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m not being stupid. I\xe2\x80\x99m employing the work of Dutch researcher, Mirjam Tuk, who found that people with full bladders make better decisions.\nLeonard: Why did I pee before I decided to move in here?\nPenny: Hi.\nLeonard: Hey. Oh, how\xe2\x80\x99d the audition go?\nPenny: I killed it. I was even able to cry real tears right on the spot.\nLeonard: Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s great.\nPenny: I know. Next time I get pulled over for a speeding ticket, here come the waterworks.\nSheldon: Here come the waterworks.\nLeonard: Aren\xe2\x80\x99t you gonna ask?\nPenny: What is this, my first day?\nCredits sequence.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nBernadette: Can I get your opinion on something that happened at work today?\nPenny: Yeah, sure.\nAmy: Of course.\nBernadette: Okay, well, I did something that will either make me look like a lovable goof or a horrible monster damned to spend eternity in hell.\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99m sure it\xe2\x80\x99s lovable.\nPenny: I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna go with monster. What do you got?\nBernadette: Well, there\xe2\x80\x99s this lady in our office who\xe2\x80\x99s retiring, and they were passing around one of those big cards for us to sign.\nAmy: Okay.\nBernadette: But no one told me she was in a horrible car accident over the weekend and what I was signing was not a retirement card but was actually a get well card.\nPenny: I\xe2\x80\x99m liking my odds here.\nBernadette: So on the card, in the hospital, next to the woman who\xe2\x80\x99s clinging to life are the words, \xe2\x80\x9cHey, Vivian. You deserve this. And at least with you gone, no one will steal my yoghurt out of the fridge.\xe2\x80\x9d\nPenny: No.\nBernadette: \xe2\x80\x9cLOL.\xe2\x80\x9d Smiley face.\nAmy: Oh, my gosh.\nBernadette: \xe2\x80\x9cP.S. Good luck wherever you wind up.\xe2\x80\x9d\nPenny: Oh. Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t I put money on this? (Phone rings) Hey, that\xe2\x80\x99s my agent. If I got the part, it\xe2\x80\x99s still the second best thing I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard all day. Hello?\nBernadette: Am I a terrible person?\nAmy: No. No, it was a mistake.\nBernadette: Am I a terrible person that it crossed my mind that she might die and never see the card?\nAmy: Now I think you\xe2\x80\x99re flirting with the line. Good news?\nPenny: No, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t get it.\nBernadette: I\xe2\x80\x99m so sorry.\nAmy: You\xe2\x80\x99ll get offered something soon.\nPenny: I kind of did. The part in that awful horror movie I passed on came back around. Apparently, it\xe2\x80\x99s mine if I want it.\nBernadette: Are you gonna take it?\nPenny: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to do.\nAmy: Maybe you\xe2\x80\x99ll get hit by a car and die. LOL, right?\nScene: A coffee shop.\nRaj: Hey. Emily, right?\nEmily: Yeah.\nRaj: I, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if you remember me.\nEmily: From the dating Web site. Your friend e-mailed me because you were afraid to, then you tracked me down and acted like a lunatic?\nRaj: Yes, Rajesh Koothrappali. Look, uh, I just, I wanted to say I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. Okay? You were, like, the coolest person I ever found online, and I got really nervous and I, I just blew it.\nEmily: Uh, don\xe2\x80\x99t worry about it. And if it makes you feel any better, you\xe2\x80\x99re not the weirdest guy I\xe2\x80\x99ve met off the Internet.\nRaj: Well, give me a chance, you don\xe2\x80\x99t even know me.\nEmily: All right, here\xe2\x80\x99s your chance.\nRaj: Ah, really? Thank you. Fate has given me a rare second chance, and I swear to Vishnu I\xe2\x80\x99m not gonna blow it. Or normal words followed by a charming smile.\nScene: Amy\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nSheldon: So, first there was PlayStation, aka PS1, then PS2, PS3 and now PS4. And that makes sense. You\xe2\x80\x99d think after Xbox, there\xe2\x80\x99d be Xbox 2. But no, next came Xbox 360. Hmm? And now, after 360, comes Xbox One. Why one? Maybe that\xe2\x80\x99s how many seconds of thought they put into naming it.\nAmy: Can you get the butter, please?\nSheldon: You know, however, with the Xbox One, I can control my entire entertainment system using voice commands. Up until now, I\xe2\x80\x99ve had to use Leonard.\nAmy: Then get the other one. Pass the butter.\nSheldon: Get? Hang on. I don\xe2\x80\x99t feel like you\xe2\x80\x99re taking this dilemma seriously.\nAmy: Fine, Sheldon. You have my undivided attention.\nSheldon: Okay, now, the PS4 is more angular and sleek-looking.\nAmy: No way.\nSheldon: Yeah, well, it\xe2\x80\x99s true. But the larger size of the Xbox One may keep it from overheating.\nAmy: Well, you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want your gaming system to overheat.\nSheldon: No, see? Well, you absolutely would not. And furthermore, the Xbox One now comes with a Kinect included.\nAmy: Included?\nSheldon: Yes. Not sold separately. Although the PS4 uses cool new GDDR5 RAM, while the Xbox One is still using the conventional DDR3 memory.\nAmy: Why would they still be using DDR3? Are they nuts?\nSheldon: See? That\xe2\x80\x99s what I thought. But then they go and throw in an ESRAM buffer.\nAmy: Whoa, whoa. Wait a second. Who\xe2\x80\x99s they?\nSheldon: Xbox.\nAmy: You\xe2\x80\x99re kidding.\nSheldon: No, I am not. And this ESRAM buffer should totally bridge the 100-gigabit-per-second bandwidth gap between the two RAM types.\nAmy: This is a nightmare. How will you ever make a decision?\nSheldon You see? I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. What should I do?\nAmy: Please pass the butter!\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nPenny: Okay, it\xe2\x80\x99s not me, right? This script is terrible.\nLeonard: Yeah. I had higher hopes for a movie called Serial Ape-ist 2: Monkey See, Monkey Kill. You know, it\xe2\x80\x99s still possible for you to be good in a bad movie.\nPenny: Okay. (Reading) Sometimes I feel like I can control the killer gorilla instinct inside of me, but then I see these bananas and I just want to eat them and then kill people. What am I gonna do?\nLeonard: Well, for starters, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t eat the bananas.\nPenny: No, come on. This is serious.\nLeonard: Uh, uh, does it at least pay well?\nPenny: Less than I was making at The Cheesecake Factory.\nLeonard: What does your agent think?\nPenny: She\xe2\x80\x99s thinking of taking a job at The Cheesecake Factory.\nLeonard: You know what, why don\xe2\x80\x99t you just do it? You\xe2\x80\x99ll go have fun for a few weeks, make some money, and who knows what it might lead to?\nPenny: Okay, look, here, page 58. I oil-wrestle an orang-utan in a bikini.\nLeonard: Just to clarify, which one of you is wearing the bikini?\nPenny: Both of us.\nLeonard: So it\xe2\x80\x99s a family film.\nScene: Amy\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nSheldon: Thank you again for dinner.\nAmy: You\xe2\x80\x99re welcome.\nSheldon: Good night.\nAmy: Uh, it\xe2\x80\x99s date night. Aren\xe2\x80\x99t you, uh, forgetting something?\nSheldon: Oh, of course. (They kiss) Did I mention the PS4 controllers light up?\nAmy: No.\nSheldon: Well, they do.\nScene: The apartment.\nRaj: And then after coffee, we went for a walk and she told me she always thought people from India were exotic and mysterious. So, with my mouth, I said, we\xe2\x80\x99re just like anybody else, but with my eyes, I said, straight up, Red, hop on my flying carpet.\nLeonard: So, are you gonna see her again?\nRaj: Yeah, we have plans this weekend. And if it\xe2\x80\x99s a clear night, I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna lay some romantic astronomy on her.\nPenny: Okay, like what? Show me.\nRaj: I can\xe2\x80\x99t do that to Leonard. This is some powerful panty-dropping stuff.\nLeonard: You have my blessing. Go for it.\nRaj: Okay. Penny, two of the brightest stars in the night sky are Altair and Vega. And it is said they were deeply in love but forever separated by the celestial river of the Milky Way.\nPenny: Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s sad.\nRaj: It is. But once a year, on the seventh day of the seventh month, Vega cries so hard that all the magpies in the world fly up and create a bridge with their wings so the two lovers can be together for a single night of passion.\nPenny: Wow.\nLeonard: Okay, that\xe2\x80\x99s enough.\nSheldon: Quick poll, PS4 or Xbox One? Raj?\nRaj: Uh, Xbox One.\nSheldon: Penny?\nPenny: Huh?\nSheldon: Leonard?\nLeonard: PS4.\nSheldon: Wolowitz?\nHoward: Both great.\nSheldon: Bernadette?\nBernadette: I like the Wii.\nSheldon: Thanks, Grandma.\nRaj: Oh, my goodness.\nLeonard: What\xe2\x80\x99s up?\nRaj: I just got an e-mail from my ex-girlfriend Lucy. She misses me and wants to get together.\nLeonard: Two women at the same time? Nice job, playa.\nPenny: Really?\nLeonard: Was it the two women thing or the playa? It was the playa.\nScene: The same, later.\nRaj: What am I supposed to do? How am I supposed to choose between Emily and Lucy?\nHoward: Why do you have to choose? Date both of them.\nRaj: I can\xe2\x80\x99t date two women at once. Zero women, that\xe2\x80\x99s my sweet spot.\nPenny: Unless you\xe2\x80\x99re sleeping with one of them, seeing other people isn\xe2\x80\x99t a big deal.\nRaj: But what if one of them asks me what I was up to the night before and I was with the other one? Then, what, do I lie?\nHoward and Bernadette (together): Yes.\nBernadette: What do you mean, yes?\nHoward: What do you mean, yes?\nBernadette: Were you seeing other women when we started dating?\nHoward: No. Were you seeing other men?\nBernadette: No.\nLeonard: Were you seeing other men?\nPenny: No.\nLeonard: Aren\xe2\x80\x99t you gonna ask me?\nPenny: Come on, really?\nScene: A coffee shop.\nLeonard: Thank you so much for letting us pick your brain.\nWil Wheaton: Yeah, happy to help. So, what\xe2\x80\x99s going on?\nPenny: Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m having an impossible time getting my career off the ground, and I got offered a role in this crappy horror movie, and I just don\xe2\x80\x99t know if I should take it.\nWil: Well, I have certainly taken some jobs that I\xe2\x80\x99ve been embarrassed by.\nPenny: I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t exactly call Star Trek embarrassing.\nWil: I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t.\nPenny: Me, either.\nLeonard: So, what do you think, is there a professional downside to doing it?\nWil: Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s tricky. You want to take projects that you\xe2\x80\x99re excited about, but sometimes you also have to pay the bills. When you\xe2\x80\x99re on the set working on something that you just know in your heart is bad, not Star Trek.\nPenny: Yeah, beam me up. I love it.\nWil: Anyway, those jobs can be soul-crushing.\nPenny: That\xe2\x80\x99s what I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid of.\nWil: So, I was in Stand By Me when I was a kid, and it was a huge success. The terrible movies I did came after that. I mean, imagine how that feels.\nLeonard: Sounds rough.\nWil: I\xe2\x80\x99m telling you, this business is brutal. To this day, I hate going on auditions. Okay, I walk in, and I can just feel them thinking, he was such a cute kid, what happened to him? And then I don\xe2\x80\x99t get the job, and I can never find out why. Honestly, I get so depressed, there are entire weeks that I can\xe2\x80\x99t even get out of bed.\nLeonard: Okay, this was helpful.\nScene: The stairwell.\nRaj: Any news on your co-worker who\xe2\x80\x99s in the hospital?\nBernadette: Poor thing, she was in surgery for 18 hours. She\xe2\x80\x99s alive, but she\xe2\x80\x99s still in critical condition.\nRaj: Oh, no.\nBernadette: The one bit of good news is they put her in a medically induced coma before she read the card. So, you know, silver linings.\nHoward: Were you like this when I married you?\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard (on phone): Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry about it, buddy. Okay, bye. That was Wil, he\xe2\x80\x99s feeling a lot better. Apparently, he\xe2\x80\x99s 12-down in the TV Guide crossword puzzle.\nRaj: Did he help you make a decision about the movie?\nPenny: No. Did you figure out what you\xe2\x80\x99re gonna do about the two girls?\nRaj: As a matter of fact, I did. I\xe2\x80\x99ve spent so many years living in fear, saying no to new experiences, but from now on, I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna say yes, yes to love, yes to adventure, yes to life. Whatever it may be, the answer\xe2\x80\x99s going to be yes.\nHoward: He\xe2\x80\x99s gonna die alone, right?\nLeonard: Yes.\nPenny: Yes.\nBernadette: Yes.\nScene: An electrical store.\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99m proud of you, Sheldon.\nSheldon: You know, I\xe2\x80\x99m proud of me, too. I\xe2\x80\x99ve done all my research, I conducted an informal poll, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve arrived at the rock-solid certainty I\xe2\x80\x99ve made the right choice.\nAmy: Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s got to be a good feeling.\nSheldon: Oh, it is. Although.\nAmy: Oh, crap.\nSheldon: I had the same feeling when I made my dad buy a Betamax instead of a VHS.\nAmy: You were just a little kid.\nSheldon: Yeah, a little kid who picked the wrong format to record The MacNeil/Lehrer Report. Now I also was certain that HD DVD would win out over Blu-ray.\nAmy: How old were you then?\nSheldon: Old enough to know better. You know, and now that I think about it, I stood in front of a case of iPods and I bought a Zune.\nAmy: What\xe2\x80\x99s a Zune?\nSheldon: Yeah, exactly. It\xe2\x80\x99s an MP3 player brought to us by the makers of Xbox.\nAmy: No, what are you doing? No, no, pick that back up. You know it\xe2\x80\x99s good. You did the research.\nSheldon: But what if I\xe2\x80\x99m wrong?\nAmy: You know what? How about I buy it for you? How about I buy you both?\nSheldon: You know I only have one slot available in my entertainment centre.\nAmy: Then I\xe2\x80\x99ll buy you a new entertainment centre.\nSheldon: Well, yeah, okay, sure. But which one?\nAmy: How about this? I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard that if you flip a coin, it will tell you how you actually feel. Because you\xe2\x80\x99ll either be disappointed or excited by the outcome.\nSheldon: Interesting.\nAmy: So, heads it\xe2\x80\x99s PS4, tails it\xe2\x80\x99s Xbox One.\nSheldon: All right, I\xe2\x80\x99ll try.\nAmy: What is it?\nSheldon: A quarter.\nAmy: Could have given it back to me. That was a choice.\nScene: A restaurant.\nRaj: You look, you look really pretty tonight.\nEmily: Thanks. I love that jacket.\nRaj: Thank you. Thanks, thanks. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. I can\xe2\x80\x99t do this. My, my ex-girlfriend e-mailed me, and I\xe2\x80\x99m seeing her Saturday, And I\xe2\x80\x99m glad you like it, it\xe2\x80\x99s from J. Crew.\nEmily: I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand.\nRaj: My friends told me it was okay to see more than one person at a time, but it, it feels like I\xe2\x80\x99m being deceitful.\nEmily: Are you getting back together with her?\nRaj: No. I, I have no idea. What would you do?\nEmily: Uh, usually on first dates, I talk about music and stuff, but I was promised weird, so let\xe2\x80\x99s do this. How serious were you two?\nRaj: Well, to be honest, we only went on four dates, hugged twice, kissed once, and there was a handshake loaded with sexual innuendo.\nEmily: Wait, so, a girl you never slept with sent you an e-mail and you felt so guilty about it that you had to tell me?\nRaj: Yeah.\nEmily: That\xe2\x80\x99s kind of adorable.\nRaj: Are you, are you sure? Because this is the part of the night where I\xe2\x80\x99ve said something stupid and the girl usually leaves.\nEmily: I\xe2\x80\x99m still here.\nRaj: Yeah, but now you make me wonder what\xe2\x80\x99s wrong with you.\nEmily: We just met. You don\xe2\x80\x99t need to tell me about other people you\xe2\x80\x99re seeing.\nRaj: Really? Because I\xe2\x80\x99m dating two women is basically the only cool thing I can say about myself.\nScene: The electrical store.\nSheldon: On the one hand, the Xbox One has a better camera, but the PS4 has a removable hard drive. Thoughts?\nAmy: I can\xe2\x80\x99t feel my legs.\nStore assistant: Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, guys, but the store closed five minutes ago.\nSheldon: But I haven\xe2\x80\x99t decided yet.\nStore assistant: You\xe2\x80\x99ll have to come back tomorrow. The registers are closed.\nAmy: Let\xe2\x80\x99s get you some food. You, You\xe2\x80\x99ll feel better after you eat.\nSheldon: Okay.\nAmy: What-what do you want, like, Thai food? A burger?\nSheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Hey, look, a quarter.\nScene: A film set. Penny is being fitted with gorilla hands.\nCostume guy: How\xe2\x80\x99s that feel?\nPenny: Great. Not like regret at all.\nWil: Penny? We\xe2\x80\x99re working together. Awesome.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
