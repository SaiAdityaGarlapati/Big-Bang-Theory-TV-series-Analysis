b'Scene: Sheldon and Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99ve been thinking about time travel again.\nLeonard: Why, did you hit a roadblock with invisibility?\nSheldon: Put it on the back burner. Anyway, it occurs to me, if I ever did perfect a time machine, I\xe2\x80\x99d just go into the past and give it to myself, thus eliminating the need for me to invent it in the first place.\nLeonard: Interesting.\nSheldon: Yeah, it really takes the pressure off.\nLeonard: Sounds like a breakthrough, should I call the science magazines and tell them to hold the front cover? (Exiting the apartment.)\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s time travel, Leonard, I will have already done that.\nLeonard: Then I guess congratulations are in order.\nSheldon: No, congratulations will have been in order. You know, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to enjoy this party.\nLeonard: I know, I\xe2\x80\x99m familiar with you.\nSheldon: At the last department party, Dr Finkleday cornered me and talked about spelunking for 45 minutes.\nLeonard: Yes, I was there.\nSheldon: You know what\xe2\x80\x99s interesting about caves, Leonard?\nLeonard: What?\nSheldon: Nothing.\nLeonard: Well then we\xe2\x80\x99ll avoid Finkleday, we\xe2\x80\x99ll meet the new department head, congratulate him, shake his hand and go.\nSheldon: How\xe2\x80\x99s this? Pleased to meet you, Dr Gablehouser. How fortunate for you that the University has chosen to hire you, despite the fact that you\xe2\x80\x99ve done no original research in 25 years, and instead have written a series of popular books that reduce the great concepts of science to a series of anecdotes, each one dumbed down to accommodate the duration of an average bowel movement. Mahalo.\nLeonard: Mahalo\xe2\x80\x99s a nice touch.\nSheldon: Do you know there are only eight consonants in the Hawaiian language.\nLeonard: Interesting, you should lead with that.\nScene: The department party. Sheldon, Raj and Leonard are at the buffet table.\nRaj: Oh, God, Look at this buffet. I love America.\nLeonard: You don\xe2\x80\x99t have buffets in India?\nRaj: Of course, but it\xe2\x80\x99s all Indian food. You can\xe2\x80\x99t find a bagel in Mumbai to save your life. Schmear me.\nSheldon: Well here\xe2\x80\x99s an interesting turn of events.\nLeonard: What. (Sees Howard entering with a statuesque blonde) Howard brought a date?\nSheldon: A more plausible explanation is that his work in robotics has made an amazing leap forward.\nHoward: Hey, what up, science bitches? May I introduce my special lady friend, Summer. (Puts arm around her.)\nSummer: I already told you, touching\xe2\x80\x99s extra.\nHoward: Right. Sorry.\nLeonard (to Sheldon): Here comes our new boss, be polite.\nGablehouser: Hi fellas, Eric Gablehouser.\nHoward: Howard Wolowitz.\nGablehouser: Howard, nice to meet you, and you are?\nSheldon: An actual real scientist. (To Leonard) How was that?\nScene: The stairwell of the apartment building. Sheldon is carrying a box of his things.\nSheldon: I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe he fired me.\nLeonard: Well, you did call him a glorified high-school science teacher whose last successful experiment was lighting his own farts.\nSheldon: In my defence, I prefaced that by saying \xe2\x80\x9cwith all due respect.\xe2\x80\x9d\nCredit sequence.\nScene: The apartment, Sheldon is in the kitchen cooking, Leonard enters.\nLeonard: Morning\nSheldon: Morning.\nLeonard: You\xe2\x80\x99re making eggs for breakfast?\nSheldon: This isn\xe2\x80\x99t breakfast, it\xe2\x80\x99s an experiment.\nLeonard: Huh? Cos it looks a lot like breakfast.\nSheldon: I finally have the time to test my hypothesis, about the separation of the water molecules from the egg proteins, and its impact vis-a-vis taste.\nLeonard: Sounds yummy. I look forward to your work with bacon.\nSheldon: As do I.\nLeonard: You know, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure if you just apologised to Gablehauser he would give you your job back.\nSheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t want my job back. I\xe2\x80\x99ve spent the last three and a half years staring at greaseboards full of equations. Before that I spent four years working on my thesis. Before that I was in college, and before that, I was in the fifth grade. This is my first day off in decades, and I\xe2\x80\x99m going to savour it.\nLeonard: Okay. I\xe2\x80\x99ll let you get back to fixing your eggs.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m not just fixing my eggs, I\xe2\x80\x99m fixing everyone\xe2\x80\x99s eggs.\nLeonard: And we all thank you.\n(Sheldon takes his eggs and sits down. Takes a photograph of them. Writes in his notebook, then takes a forkful. Writes in notebook again.)\nSheldon: Use new eggs. (There is a knock on the door).\nPenny (popping her head round): Hi, hey. I\xe2\x80\x99m running out to the market, do you guys need anything?\nSheldon: Oh, well this would be one of those circumstances that people unfamiliar with the law of large numbers would call a coincidence.\nPenny: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry?\nSheldon: I need eggs. Four dozen should suffice.\nPenny: Four dozen?\nSheldon: Yes, and evenly distributed amongst brown, white, free range, large, extra-large and jumbo.\nPenny: Okay, one more time?\nSheldon: Never mind, you won\xe2\x80\x99t get it right, I\xe2\x80\x99d better come with you.\nPenny: Oh, yay!\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s car\nPenny: How come you didn\xe2\x80\x99t go into work today.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m taking a sabbatical, because I won\xe2\x80\x99t kow-tow to mediocre minds.\nPenny: So you got canned, huh?\nSheldon: Theoretical physicists do not get canned. But yeah.\nPenny: Well, maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s all for the best, you know I always say, when one door closes, another one opens.\nSheldon: No it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t. Not unless the two doors are connected by relays, or there are motion sensors involved.\nPenny: No, no, I meant\xe2\x80\xa6\nSheldon: Or the first door closing causes a change of air pressure that acts upon the second door.\nPenny: Never mind.\nSheldon: Slow down. Slow down, please slow down.\nPenny: We\xe2\x80\x99re fine.\nSheldon: Look, you\xe2\x80\x99re not leaving yourself enough space between cars.\nPenny: Oh, sure I am.\nSheldon: No, no. Let me do the math for you, this car weighs let\xe2\x80\x99s say 4,000lb, now add say 140 for me, 120 for you.\nPenny: 120?\nSheldon: Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, did I insult you? Is your body mass somehow tied into your self worth?\nPenny: Well, yeah.\nSheldon: Interesting. Anyway, that gives us a total weight of, let\xe2\x80\x99s say, 4,400lb.\nPenny: Let\xe2\x80\x99s say 4,390.\nSheldon: Fine. We\xe2\x80\x99re travelling forward at, good Lord, 51 miles an hour. Now let\xe2\x80\x99s assume that your brakes are new and the callipers are aligned, still, by the time we come to a stop, we\xe2\x80\x99ll be occupying the same space as that Buick in front of us, an impossibility that nature will quickly resolve into death, mutilation and\xe2\x80\xa6 oh look, they built a new put-put course.\nScene: The supermarket.\nSheldon: This is great. Look at me, out in the real world of ordinary people, just living their ordinary, colourless, workaday lives.\nPenny: Thank you.\nSheldon: No, thank you. And thank you, ordinary person. Hey, you want to hear an interesting thing about tomatoes.\nPenny: Uh, no, no not really. Listen, didn\xe2\x80\x99t you say you needed some eggs.\nSheldon: Uh, yes, but anyone who knows anything about the dynamics of bacterial growth knows to pick up their refrigerated foods on the way out of the supermarket.\nPenny: Oh, okay, well maybe you should start heading on out then.\nSheldon: No, this is fun. Oh, the thing about tomatoes, and I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll really enjoy this, is, they\xe2\x80\x99re shelved with the vegetables, but they\xe2\x80\x99re technically a fruit.\nPenny: Interesting.\nSheldon: Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\nPenny: No, I mean what you find enjoyable.\nSheldon (as Penny selects vitamin supplements): Oh boy.\nPenny: What now?\nSheldon: Well, there\xe2\x80\x99s some value to taking a multivitamin, but the human body can only absorb so much, what you\xe2\x80\x99re buying here are the ingredients for very expensive urine.\nPenny: Well, maybe that\xe2\x80\x99s what I was going for.\nSheldon: Well then you\xe2\x80\x99ll want some manganese.\nScene: On the stairwell of the apartment building.\nSheldon: That was fun. Maybe tomorrow we can go to one of those big warehouse stores.\nPenny: Oh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know Sheldon, it\xe2\x80\x99s going to take me a while to recover from all the fun I had today.\nSheldon: Are you sure. There are a lot of advantages to buying in bulk. For example, I noticed that you purchase your tampons one month\xe2\x80\x99s supply at a time.\nPenny: What?\nSheldon: Well think about it, it\xe2\x80\x99s a product that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t spoil, and you\xe2\x80\x99re going to be needing them for at least the next thirty years.\nPenny: You want me to buy thirty years worth of tampons?\nSheldon: Well, thirty, thirty five, hey, when did your mother go into menopause?\nPenny: Okay, I\xe2\x80\x99m not talking about this with you.\nSheldon: Oh, Penny, this is a natural human process, and we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about statistically significant savings. Now, if you assume 15 tampons per cycle and a 28 day cycle, are you fairly regular? (Penny shuts door in his face.) Okay, no warehouse store, but we\xe2\x80\x99re still on for put-put golf, right?\nScene: The apartment, Sheldon has several bowls containing goldfish.\nLeonard (entering): Hey, I just ran into Penny, she seemed upset about something.\nSheldon: I think it\xe2\x80\x99s her time of the month. I marked the calendar for future reference.\nLeonard: What\xe2\x80\x99s with the fish?\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s an experiment.\nLeonard: What happened to your scrambled egg research?\nSheldon: Oh, that was a dead end. Scrambled eggs are as good as they\xe2\x80\x99re ever going to be.\nLeonard: So\xe2\x80\xa6 fish.\nSheldon: I read an article about Japanese scientists, who inserted DNA from luminous jellyfish into other animals, and I thought hey, fish nightlights.\nLeonard: Fish nightlights.\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s a billion dollar idea. Shhhhh!\nLeonard: Mum\xe2\x80\x99s the word. Sheldon, are you sure you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to just apologise to Gablehauser and get your job back.\nSheldon: Oh, no, no, no. No, I\xe2\x80\x99ve too much to do.\nLeonard: Like luminous fish.\nSheldon: Shhhhh!\nLeonard: Right\xe2\x80\xa6 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\xa6.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s just the beginning. I also have an idea for a bulk mail-order feminine hygiene company. Oh, glow in the dark tampons! Leonard, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be rich.\nScene: The stairwell of the apartment building.\nLeonard: Thank you for coming on such short notice.\nMrs Cooper: You did the right thing calling.\nLeonard: I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what else to do, he\xe2\x80\x99s lost all focus, every day he\xe2\x80\x99s got a new obsession. (They enter the apartment. Sheldon is weaving on a loom. He is wrapped in a poncho.) This is a particularly disturbing one.\nSheldon (looking round): Mommy.\nMrs Cooper: Hi baby.\nSheldon (mouths): You called my mother?\nMrs Cooper: Oh, you got yourself a loom, how nice.\nSheldon: Thank you.\nMrs Cooper: Honey, why did you get a loom?\nSheldon: I was working with luminous fish, and I thought, hey, loom! Mom, what are you doing here?\nMrs Cooper: Leonard called me.\nSheldon: I know, but why?\nLeonard: Because one of the great minds of the twenty-first century is raising glow-in-the-dark fish and weaving sarapes.\nSheldon: This is not a sarape. This is a poncho. A sarape is open at the sides, a poncho is closed, this is a poncho, and neither is a reason to call someone\xe2\x80\x99s mother.\nLeonard: Really, when was the last time you left the house.\nSheldon: I went to the market with Penny.\nLeonard: That was three weeks ago.\nSheldon: Well then buckle up, in the next four to eight days she\xe2\x80\x99s going to get very crabby.\nMrs Cooper: Sweetheart, your little friend is concerned about you.\nSheldon: Yes, well I\xe2\x80\x99m not a child, I\xe2\x80\x99m a grown man capable of living my life as I see fit. And I certainly don\xe2\x80\x99t need someone telling on me to my mother.\nLeonard: Where are you going?\nSheldon: To my room, and no-one\xe2\x80\x99s allowed in.\nMrs Cooper: He gets his temper from his daddy.\nLeonard: Oh.\nMrs Cooper: He\xe2\x80\x99s got my eyes.\nLeonard: I see.\nMrs Cooper: All that science stuff, that comes from Jesus.\nScene: Everyone but Sheldon is in the kitchen of the apartment.\nLeonard: Sheldon? Your mum made dinner.\nSheldon (off): I\xe2\x80\x99m not hungry.\nMrs Cooper: Oh, Leonard, don\xe2\x80\x99t trouble yourself, he\xe2\x80\x99s stubborn. He may stay in there \xe2\x80\x98til the Rapture.\nPenny: Are we so sure that\xe2\x80\x99s a bad thing?\nMrs Cooper: I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell ya, I love the boy to death, but he has been difficult since he fell out of me at the K-Mart.\nHoward: Excuse me for being so bold, but I now see where Sheldon gets his smouldering good looks.\nMrs Cooper: Oh, honey that ain\xe2\x80\x99t going to work, but you keep trying. (To Raj) I made chicken, I hope that isn\xe2\x80\x99t one of the animals that you people think is magic? You know, we have an Indian gentleman at our church, a Dr Patel, it\xe2\x80\x99s a beautiful story, the lord spoke to him, and moved him to give us all 20% off on lasic, you know, those that needed it.\nLeonard: That is a lovely story, um, are we going to do anything about Sheldon?\nMrs Cooper: Oh, we will, you have to take your time with Sheldon. His father, God rest his soul, used to say to me, Mary, you have to take your time with Sheldon.\nLeonard: Sounds like a wise man.\nMrs Cooper: Oh, not so wise, he was trying to fight a bobcat for some licquorish. So, everybody grab a plate, and a pretty place mat that Shelly wove.\nPenny: Has Shelly ever freaked out like this before.\nMrs Cooper: Oh, all the time, I remember one summer when he was thirteen, he built a small nuclear reactor in the shed and told everybody he was going to provide free electricity for the whole town, well the only problem was he had no, whatchacall, fissionable materials. Anyway, when he went on the internets to get some, a man from the government came by and sat him down real gentle and told him it\xe2\x80\x99s against the law to have yellow cake uranium in a shed.\nPenny: What happened?\nMrs Cooper: Well, the poor boy had a fit, locked himself in his room and built a sonic death ray.\nLeonard: A death ray?\nMrs Cooper: Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s what he called it, didn\xe2\x80\x99t even slow down the neighbour kids. It pissed our dog off to no end. You know, you two make a cute couple.\nBoth Leonard and Penny laugh, a little too forced.\nLeonard: No, we\xe2\x80\x99re not, we\xe2\x80\x99re not, not a couple, two singles, like those individually wrapped slices of cheese that\xe2\x80\xa6. are friends.\nMrs Cooper: Did I pluck a nerve there?\nHoward: Oh yeah.\nMrs Cooper: Okay. Alright everybody, it\xe2\x80\x99s time to eat. (Everybody begins to do so) Oh Lord, we thank you for this meal, all your bounty, and we pray that you help Sheldon get back on his rocker. (To Raj and Howard) Now after a moment of silent meditation I\xe2\x80\x99m going to end with \xe2\x80\x9cIn Jesus\xe2\x80\x99 Name\xe2\x80\x9d but you two don\xe2\x80\x99t feel any obligation to join in. Unless, of course, the holy spirit moves you.\nTime shift\nPenny: Oh my God, this is the best cobbler I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever had.\nMrs Cooper: It was always Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99 s favourite. You know what the secret ingredient is?\nPenny: Love?\nMrs Cooper: Lard.\nSheldon emerges from the bedroom area.\nHoward: Hey, look who\xe2\x80\x99s come out\xe2\x80\xa6.\nMrs Cooper: Shhh! You\xe2\x80\x99ll spook him. He\xe2\x80\x99s like a baby deer, you gotta let him come to you.\nSheldon crosses to the cobbler, takes some and puts it on a plate. Looks round at the group in the matter of a frightened animal. Everyone but Leonard looks down at their meal.\nLeonard: This is ridiculous. Dammit, Sheldon, snap out of it. You\xe2\x80\x99re a physicist, you belong at the University doing research, not hiding in your room. (Sheldon scuttles away)\nMrs Cooper: You don\xe2\x80\x99t hunt, do you?\nScene: Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom. He is building a model of some kind of double helix. There is a knock on the door.\nMrs Cooper (entering): Good morning, snicker-doodle.\nSheldon: Morning.\nMrs Cooper: Oh, well that looks awful fancy, what is that?\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s my idea of what DNA would look like in a silicon based life form.\nMrs Cooper: But intelligently designed by a creator, right?\nSheldon: What do you want, mom?\nMrs Cooper: You know how your daddy used to say that you can only fish for so long before you got to throw a stick of dynamite in the water?\nSheldon: Yeah.\nMrs Cooper: Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m done fishing. (Throwing a pair of trousers on the bed) You put those on.\nSheldon: What for?\nMrs Cooper: Because you\xe2\x80\x99re going to go down to your office, you\xe2\x80\x99re going to apologise to your boss, and get your job back.\nSheldon: No.\nMrs Cooper: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, did I start that sentence with the words \xe2\x80\x9cif it please your highness?\xe2\x80\x9d\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to apologise, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t say anything that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t true.\nMrs Cooper: Now you listen here, I have been telling you since you were four years old, it\xe2\x80\x99s okay to be smarter than everybody but you can\xe2\x80\x99t go around pointing it out.\nSheldon: Why not?\nMrs Cooper: Because people don\xe2\x80\x99t like it. Remember all the ass-kickings you got from the neighbour kids? Now let\xe2\x80\x99s get cracking. Shower, shirt, shoes, and let\xe2\x80\x99s shove off. (Exits)\nSheldon: Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been any ass-kickings if that stupid death ray had worked.\nScene: The kitchen\nMrs Cooper: Problem solved.\nLeonard: Really? That\xe2\x80\x99s impressive.\nMrs Cooper: Leonard, the Lord never gives us more than we can handle. Thankfully he blessed me with two other children who are dumb as soup.\nScene: Dr Gablehouser\xe2\x80\x99s office\nMrs Cooper: Excuse me, Dr Gablehouser, are you busy?\nGablehouser: Well, actually\xe2\x80\xa6.\nMrs Cooper: Sheldon, he\xe2\x80\x99s just doodling, get in here.\nSheldon: Dr Gablehouser.\nGablehouser: Dr Cooper.\nMrs Cooper: Let\xe2\x80\x99s go, baby, we\xe2\x80\x99re losing daylight.\nSheldon: Um, as you know, several weeks ago in our first encounter we may have gotten off on the wrong foot, when I called you an idiot. And I just wanted to say that I was wrong. To point it out.\nGablehouser (to Mrs Cooper): I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, we haven\xe2\x80\x99t been introduced. Dr Eric Gablehouser.\nMrs Cooper: Mary Cooper, Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s mom.\nGablehouser: Now that\xe2\x80\x99s impossible, you must have had him when you were a teenager.\nMrs Cooper: Oh, aren\xe2\x80\x99t you sweet, his father\xe2\x80\x99s dead.\nGablehouser: Recently?\nMrs Cooper: Long enough.\nGablehouser (indicating chair): Please. Sheldon, shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you be working?\nSheldon (leaving): Okay.\nLeonard: Hey, how did it go?\nSheldon: I got my job back.\nLeonard: Really? What happened?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m not quite sure. It involves a part of the human experience that has always eluded me.\nLeonard: That narrows it down.\nScene: Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom. Mrs Cooper is tucking him in.\nMrs Cooper: I\xe2\x80\x99m very proud of you honey, you showed a lot of courage today.\nSheldon: Thanks, mom. Mom?\nMrs Cooper: Mmm-hmm?\nSheldon: Is Dr Gablehouser going to be my new daddy?\nMrs Cooper: We\xe2\x80\x99ll see. Sleep tight.\nSheldon turns over to sleep in the glow of a luminous goldfish.\nTeleplay: David Litt & Lee Aronsohn\nStory: Chuck Lorre & Bill Prady\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
