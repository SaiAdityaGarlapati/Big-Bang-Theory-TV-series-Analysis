b'Scene: The apartment.\nPenny: Hey, can you help me put some of the food out?\nLeonard: Yeah. Let me finish packing this stuff up. You know how Sheldon is if he sees Christmas stuff lying around after New Year\xe2\x80\x99s.\nPenny: Yeah, but he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t live here anymore.\nLeonard: Well, he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t live at Walmart, but he still threw a tantrum when he saw Marshmallow Peeps after Easter. And that\xe2\x80\x99s the same man who complains you can\xe2\x80\x99t find Marshmallow Peeps after Easter.\nPenny (checking phone): Oh. It\xe2\x80\x99s Bernadette. She says they\xe2\x80\x99re running late. The baby threw up on Howard, and then Howard threw up on Howard.\nLeonard: Well, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t throw up on the baby. That\xe2\x80\x99s a win.\nSheldon: Hello.\nAmy: Hi.\nPenny: Hi. Welcome back. How was Texas?\nSheldon: Oh, you know., the lone star state. Hmm. That should be its Yelp rating.\nAmy: It was not a great trip.\nPenny: Well, you\xe2\x80\x99re home now.\nSheldon: Yeah. It is good to be home. Oh, good lord, is that mistletoe? Don\xe2\x80\x99t you maniacs own a calendar?\nPenny: I told him to take it down. He would not listen to me.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: Did you at least have a good flight down there?\nSheldon: It was fine. Other than the weird-tasting juice Amy gave me, I slept the whole way.\nPenny: So, what happened in Texas that was so bad?\nLeonard: And before our next drive to Comic-Con, I need the name of that juice.\nSheldon: Well, we were on our way to my mother\xe2\x80\x99s house\xe2\x80\xa6\nFlashback.\nSheldon: How did we get in the car?\nBack to apartment.\nLeonard: Hold on. How did you get him in the car?\nAmy: I rented one of those carts, pushed him toward the open door and just let inertia take care of the rest.\nFlashback.\nAmy: So, while we\xe2\x80\x99re at your mother\xe2\x80\x99s house, it might be a good time to tell her that we\xe2\x80\x99re living together.\nSheldon: Do we have to? I really don\xe2\x80\x99t want to hear the religious lecture.\nAmy: Maybe there won\xe2\x80\x99t be one.\nSheldon: There\xe2\x80\x99s always one. She gave it to my sister about her boyfriend, my brother about his girlfriend, my father about his girlfriend. That one had some un-Christian words in it.\nAmy: Well, she likes me. You know, there\xe2\x80\x99s a chance she might be okay with it.\nSheldon: Eh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I am her precious little boy. And you did take my flower.\nBack to apartment.\nPenny: Do boys have flowers?\nLeonard: Who knows what he has down there.\nPenny: Mm.\nSheldon: Anyway\xe2\x80\xa6\nFlashback.\nMary: Thank you, God, for the food we are about to receive and for the nourishment of our bodies and bless the hands that prepared it. Amen.\nSheldon: Given that your hands prepared it, isn\xe2\x80\x99t that a little self-serving?\nMary: You start changing the words to the prayers, next thing you know, you\xe2\x80\x99re in a church with a guitar.\nAmy: Thank you for cooking, it looks delicious.\nMary: Oh, it\xe2\x80\x99s my pleasure. Mm. I\xe2\x80\x99m so glad y\xe2\x80\x99all could make it. So, tell me, what\xe2\x80\x99s going on back home?\nAmy: Well, uh, Howard and Bernadette had their baby.\nMary: Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s wonderful. Now, have they decided to raise it Jewish or regular?\nSheldon: Welcome to Texas.\nAmy: They haven\xe2\x80\x99t said. Anyway, we, uh, we also have some exciting news to share.\nSheldon: Oh, wait, wait, shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t we just eat? You know, I mean, God did take time out of his busy schedule to bless these Sloppy Joes.\nMary: Come on, Shelly, tell me your news.\nSheldon: All right. This is on you. Amy and I are living together in sin, like a couple of New Yorkers. Now, while you scold us, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to get a knife and a fork. Joe may be sloppy, but Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s not.\nMary: Well, thank you for letting me know, and I, for one, am thrilled.\nSheldon: What? Wh, where\xe2\x80\x99s the judgment? Wh, where\xe2\x80\x99s the fire and brimstone? Where\xe2\x80\x99s the part where you tell us we\xe2\x80\x99re going to Hell and I say have you seen the size of the bugs outside? We\xe2\x80\x99re already there.\nMary: Obviously, I would prefer if you weren\xe2\x80\x99t living out of wedlock, but given your special circumstances, I\xe2\x80\x99m very happy for you.\nSheldon: And what special circumstances are those?\nBack to apartment.\nPenny: Oh, boy, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s about to get bad.\nFlashback.\nMary: Shelly, how do I put this? By your third birthday, you had memorized over a thousand different kinds of trains, and I never imagined a woman getting aboard any of them.\nSheldon: What, so you thought I was going to be alone for the rest of my life?\nMary: No. Just for the middle part. \xe2\x80\x98Cause at the end I assumed there\xe2\x80\x99d be nurses.\nSheldon: Well, this is highly insulting.\nAmy: Sheldon, don\xe2\x80\x99t overreact.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m the child she was worried about? I have a brother and sister whose combined intellectual wattage couldn\xe2\x80\x99t power a potato clock, if I spotted them the potato.\nAmy: Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.\nMary: Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.\nBack to apartment.\nPenny: What?\nSheldon: Well, I was in my room, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t hear what they were saying.\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99ll take over from here.\nFlashback.\nAmy: He\xe2\x80\x99s been in there a long time. Should I go talk to him?\nMary: He\xe2\x80\x99s upset with me. I should be the one who talks to him.\nAmy: Are you going to?\nMary: Oh, heck no.\nAmy: Sheldon, what, what are you doing?\nSheldon: Just being the unsocialised eccentric my mother always thought I was.\nMary: You startin\xe2\x80\x99 to see why I didn\xe2\x80\x99t go in there? Sheldon, if you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to prove me wrong, the tighty-whities on your head ain\xe2\x80\x99t changing my mind.\nAmy: We\xe2\x80\x99re ignoring the fins, okay.\nSheldon: Yeah. And I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand why you\xe2\x80\x99re taking her side. By being my girlfriend, she\xe2\x80\x99s saying you\xe2\x80\x99re a weirdo, too.\nAmy: I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x99s what she\xe2\x80\x99s saying.\nBack to apartment.\nSheldon: And?\nAmy: That\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what she was saying.\nSheldon: Can you believe my mother thinks we\xe2\x80\x99re both strange?\nLeonard: Absolutely not.\nPenny: That\xe2\x80\x99s too loud.\nLeonard: Absolutely not.\nAmy: Well, after that, Sheldon and I got out of the house for a while.\nSheldon: Well, first we buttered my feet to get the swim fins off, and then we went out.\nFlashback.\nAmy: You know, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry your mother made you feel bad. But, you know, at the end of the day, she was wrong, because you\xe2\x80\x99re not alone.\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re right. I have Leonard and Howard and Raj, Stuart, Penny, Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s mom, Bernadette, Wil Wheaton\xe2\x80\xa6\nAmy: What about the woman who just buttered your big flat feet?\nSheldon: I was going chronologically. You\xe2\x80\x99re right between Koothrappali\xe2\x80\x99s father and Omar, the one-eyed Sparkletts guy.\nAmy: Well, let\xe2\x80\x99s try to not let it ruin the rest of our trip.\nSheldon: I knew we should\xe2\x80\x99ve never mentioned us living together in the first place.\nAmy: She was gonna find out eventually.\nSheldon: Disagree. We\xe2\x80\x99ve known about evolution since 1859, she still believes in Noah and his amazing zoo boat. This could have all been avoided if you\xe2\x80\x99d only listened to me.\nAmy: Sheldon, I knew your mother was fine with us living together because I already told her we were.\nSheldon: Why would you do that?\nAmy: This was a potential issue, so I got out ahead of it and I managed the situation for you.\nSheldon: You managed the situation?\nAmy: That\xe2\x80\x99s right.\nSheldon: So my mother thought I was incapable of finding a mate, and my mate thinks I\xe2\x80\x99m incapable of running my own life.\nAmy: Not your whole life. I mean, science, you got that. Organizing your sock drawer, you\xe2\x80\x99re the king. But understanding how other people are feeling, that\xe2\x80\x99s a weak spot for you.\nSheldon: I have gotten much better at that.\nAmy: Have you? How am I feeling right now?\nSheldon: What? How should I know? Excited? Itchy? Give me the first letter.\nAmy: You and I are in a relationship. I help you with your shortcomings, and you help me with mine.\nSheldon: How would you feel if I contacted your mother behind your back?\nAmy: Delighted that you showed any interest in my family at all?\nSheldon: Delighted? What., not if I guessed for a hundred years.\nBack to apartment.\nBernadette: Hi.\nHoward: Hey, guys.\nLeonard: Hey.\nPenny: Hi. There\xe2\x80\x99s the little family!\nRaj: Hello.\nStuart: Hello.\nLeonard: And their Sherpas.\nPenny: Mm.\nHoward: The baby\xe2\x80\x99s asleep, can we put her in your room?\nPenny: Yeah. Go ahead.\nAmy: Do you need help?\nHoward: No. I got it. Doubtfire, Poppins, follow me.\nBernadette: Sorry we\xe2\x80\x99re late.\nPenny: Oh, it\xe2\x80\x99s no problem, Amy and Sheldon were just telling us about their trip to Texas.\nSheldon: Yeah. Here. I\xe2\x80\x99ll catch you up.\nFlashback.\nSheldon: How did we get in the car?\nBack to apartment.\nPenny: Stop. Okay. They told Mary they were living together, there was a fight, he got his feelings hurt, then he put underwear on his head.\nLeonard: On purpose, not the way it used to happen in high school.\nSheldon: I was acting odd intentionally.\nBernadette: Really? So you can control it?\nPenny: Okay. Then what happened?\nSheldon: Well, there\xe2\x80\x99s really not much left to tell. I decided that my mother views me as a child because I never went through a rebellious phase, so, I got an earring. (Flashback to Sheldon screaming.) My mother made me take it out. (Flashback to Sheldon screaming.) Amy put alcohol on it. (Flashback to Sheldon screaming.) And here we are.\nHoward: What did we miss?\nBernadette: I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t explain it if I tried.\nScene: The same, later.\nPenny: So tell me, how did Sheldon look with an earring?\nAmy: Like the pirate who helps the other pirates connect to the Internet.\nHoward: So what did you and Leonard do?\nPenny: Actually, we got in a pretty nasty fight.\nLeonard: It might\xe2\x80\x99ve been the worst one we\xe2\x80\x99ve ever had.\nRaj: Oh, my God, what happened?\nLeonard: Well, we had started binge-watching Luke Cage together, and it was kind of our thing, and then I find out that she watched two episodes without me.\nBernadette: It\xe2\x80\x99s like I was excited for a present and got socks.\nStuart: I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand how that turns into the worst fight of your life.\nSheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand what\xe2\x80\x99s wrong with socks.\nPenny: To be fair, we may have been on edge because of the Christmas tree.\nHoward: What happened\nFlashback.\nPenny: You do make a cute elf.\nLeonard: Oh, yeah? And you thought Spock ears were only good for Comic-Con.\nPenny: Hey, hey, I just found a farm where they let you chop down your own tree.\nLeonard: Oh cool, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be like a pointy-eared Paul Bunyan.\nTime lapse.\nLeonard: Stupid idea.\nPenny: No, what\xe2\x80\x99s stupid is a physicist who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t understand when you swing an axe, you don\xe2\x80\x99t let go.\nLeonard: For the tenth time, my mittens were slippery!\nPenny: Ugh. It\xe2\x80\x99s 70 degrees, you didn\xe2\x80\x99t need mittens.\nLeonard: You know how easily I blister.\nPenny: Yes, yes, you bruise, you peel. It\xe2\x80\x99s like I\xe2\x80\x99m married to an old piece of fruit.\nLeonard: Look, we could keep fighting and let it ruin our night, or, or we can stop and try to salvage the evening.\nPenny: Fine.\nLeonard: Thank you.\nPenny: Leonard?\nLeonard: Yeah.\nPenny: There\xe2\x80\x99s something on the windshield.\nFlash forward to the stairwell.\nPenny: You need a break?\nLeonard: Do not need a break.\nPenny: There\xe2\x80\x99s no shame in asking for a break.\nLeonard: If I need a break, I\xe2\x80\x99ll ask for a break.\nFlash forward.\nPenny: Ugh. Leonard?\nLeonard: Yeah?\nPenny: There\xe2\x80\x99s a tree on you.\nFlash forward.\nLeonard: You want to decorate it tonight?\nPenny: Yeah, with gasoline and a match? Sure.\nLeonard (hearing animal noises): I hope it kills us both.\nBack to apartment.\nLeonard: By the way, if anyone asks, the elevator shaft always had a tree in it.\nSheldon: So Bernadette, if I express interest in your baby will you promise not to make me touch it?\nBernadette: Sure.\nSheldon: Hey, how\xe2\x80\x99s life with your baby?\nAmy: Really? You\xe2\x80\x99re never gonna touch their baby?\nSheldon: To this day I\xe2\x80\x99ve never touched Stuart.\nBernadette: It\xe2\x80\x99s been wonderful, Sheldon, thanks for asking.\nFlashback.\nBernadette: Oh, please stop crying, I\xe2\x80\x99m begging you. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what else to do. My boobs are empty. Do you want lasagna? Shh, shh, shh, it\xe2\x80\x99s okay, it\xe2\x80\x99s okay. Shh. What have we done?\nHoward: Hey, I found superhero baby wipes, the perfect way to clean up crime, and tushies.\nBernadette: It took me two hours to get her down.\nRaj: You know, in India when my baby brother cried like that, the servants would just take him far away so we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t hear it. Not always, sometimes we\xe2\x80\x99d leave.\nHoward: Hey, he got her to stop.\nBernadette: That was so fast.\nRaj: Oh, he\xe2\x80\x99s really good with her.\nBernadette: Yeah, he has a gift.\nHoward: What\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\nBernadette: Nothing, these are happy tears.\nHoward: Oh, good.\nBernadette: No they\xe2\x80\x99re not, you bozo. How come Stuart can get her to stop crying, but I can\xe2\x80\x99t?\nHoward: I mean, it\xe2\x80\x99s Stuart. Maybe she\xe2\x80\x99s playing possum until he goes away.\nBernadette: Not funny.\nRaj: She\xe2\x80\x99s tired, that was funny.\nBernadette: Everyone\xe2\x80\x99s a better mom than me.\nRaj: Oh, don\xe2\x80\x99t take it so personally, maybe your baby\xe2\x80\x99s just a jerk.\nBack to apartment.\nSheldon: Wait, so how does the story end? Is the baby a jerk or is Bernadette a bad mother?\nAmy: Sheldon.\nSheldon: What? Is there another twist coming? Is the baby not theirs at all?\nLeonard: Ignore him. How did you get the baby to stop crying?\nStuart: Oh, I just talked to her. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been told the sound of my voice puts people to sleep.\nPenny: You poor things you must be exhausted.\nHoward: It has been hard to sleep with all the crying.\nFlashback.\nBernadette: How can she hate me? I make her food in my chest. It\xe2\x80\x99s like hating a frozen yogurt machine.\nHoward: She doesn\xe2\x80\x99t hate you, stop saying that.\nBernadette: Now you hate me too.\nHoward: Shh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t hate you.\nBack to apartment.\nSheldon: It says here that up to 80% of new mothers experience baby blues. And that the best thing to do is reassure them that they\xe2\x80\x99re doing a good job. Bernadette, you are doing a good job.\nBernadette: Thank you, Sheldon, I\xe2\x80\x99m feeling better now.\nSheldon: Thank you, Internet. I\xe2\x80\x99m telling you, with the right YouTube video, I can give Howard a vasectomy.\nPenny: So things started to turn around?\nBernadette: Yeah, eventually I figured out how to get the baby to sleep.\nLeonard: Please tell me you didn\xe2\x80\x99t use Amy\xe2\x80\x99s magic juice.\nFlashback.\nHoward: Bernie?\nBernadette: Shh. She\xe2\x80\x99s asleep.\nHoward: Great. And where are you?\nBernadette: Down here.\nHoward: Oh. This is new.\nBernadette: I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what else to do. It worked.\nHoward: Well, I\xe2\x80\x99d say that\xe2\x80\x99s thinking outside the box, but, come on.\nBernadette: Don\xe2\x80\x99t make me laugh.\nHoward: Do you need help getting out?\nBernadette: I think I live here now. It\xe2\x80\x99s fine.\nHoward: Is it okay if I get some sleep?\nBernadette: Yeah, go ahead.\nHoward: Good job, Mommy. I\xe2\x80\x99m proud of you.\nBernadette: Don\xe2\x80\x99t make me cry, either.\nHoward: Good night. I love both my girls.\nBernadette: We love you, too.\nBack to apartment.\nPenny: I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe you fit in the crib.\nBernadette: I could take a bath in the sink. I don\xe2\x80\x99t, but I can.\nRaj: So how were your holidays?\nStuart: Oh, thank you for asking. Uh, I, uh, went to visit my grandmother. She\xe2\x80\x99s in Bakersfield. Uh, usually my brother and sister go\xe2\x80\xa6 oh come on.\nScene: The same, later.\nAmy: That was fun, thank you.\nBernadette: Yeah, thanks.\nPenny: Our pleasure.\nLeonard: See you guys at work.\nRaj: Be there bright and early.\nHoward: Not me, paternity leave.\nSheldon: Oh. A small human wreaks havoc on his wife\xe2\x80\x99s genitals and he gets time off.\nHoward: With pay, sucka. Forgot the baby, still new to this.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
