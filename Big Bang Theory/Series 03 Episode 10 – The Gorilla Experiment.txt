b'Scene: The apartment\nPenny: Hey, Leonard, check this out. (Throws some food in the air and catches it in her mouth)\nSheldon: Leonard, she\xe2\x80\x99s doing it again.\nLeonard: I think it upsets Sheldon when you play with the food.\nSheldon: No. It upsets Sheldon when she willy-nilly takes it from the containers without regard for its equitable distribution. This is essentially why you have famine in India.\nPenny: You want me to put it back?\nSheldon: Leonard.\nLeonard: It upsets Sheldon when you play with the Sheldon.\nHoward (arriving): What\xe2\x80\x99s up, my nerdizzles? Raj, Sheldon, I want you to meet my girlfriend Bernadette.\nSheldon: Hello.\nHoward: Leonard, Penny, you know my girlfriend Bernadette.\nLeonard: Yeah. Hey.\nHoward: Bernadette, say fo\xe2\x80\x99shizzle to my nerdizzles.\nBernadette: I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I can. I don\xe2\x80\x99t have Howard\xe2\x80\x99s street cred.\nHoward: I hope it\xe2\x80\x99s all right, I told my girlfriend Bernadette she could join us for dinner.\nLeonard: Sure. The more, the merrier.\nSheldon: Wait, no, that\xe2\x80\x99s a false equivalency. More does not equal merry. If there were 2,000 people in this apartment right now, would we be celebrating? No, we\xe2\x80\x99d be suffocating.\nLeonard: Sheldon\xe2\x80\xa6\nSheldon: Don\xe2\x80\x99t Sheldon me. We ordered for five people, not six.\nPenny: Oh, come on, it\xe2\x80\x99s fine. We\xe2\x80\x99ll just put it all on the table, you know, family style.\nSheldon: Oh, sure. And while we\xe2\x80\x99re at it, why don\xe2\x80\x99t we put our hands behind our backs, have an old-fashioned eating contest?\nLeonard: Relax, it\xe2\x80\x99ll be fine, sit down, you guys.\nEveryone: NO!\nBernadette: What?\nPenny: Oh, yeah, you can\xe2\x80\x99t sit there.\nBernadette: Why not?\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99s where Sheldon sits.\nBernadette: He can\xe2\x80\x99t sit somewhere else?\nPenny: Oh no, no, you see, in the winter, that seat is close enough to the radiator so that he\xe2\x80\x99s warm, yet not so close that he sweats. In the summer, it\xe2\x80\x99s directly in the path of a cross-breeze created by opening windows there and there. It faces the television at an angle that isn\xe2\x80\x99t direct, so he can still talk to everybody, yet not so wide that the picture looks distorted.\nSheldon: Perhaps there\xe2\x80\x99s hope for you after all.\nCredits sequence.\n  Scene: A few moments later.\nBernadette: Ooh, I love your shoes.\nPenny: Oh, thanks. They are cute, aren\xe2\x80\x99t they?\nBernadette: Where\xe2\x80\x99d you get them?\nPenny: Shoes for Less.\nBernadette: I\xe2\x80\x99ve been meaning to go over there.\nPenny: Oh, great selection, great prices.\nSheldon: My mother was right. Hell is real.\nHoward: Come on, Sheldon. let the womenfolk chat.\nPenny: Womenfolk?\nHoward: Gals? Chicks? Utero-Americans?\nPenny: Just eat your dinner.\nBernadette: Don\xe2\x80\x99t take him too seriously, a lot of what he says is intended as humour.\nPenny: Yeah, well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s very funny.\nBernadette: Me neither, but he just lights up when I laugh.\nPenny: Howard, never let her go.\nBernadette: So, Leonard, Howard says you\xe2\x80\x99re working on fundamental tests of quantum mechanics.\nLeonard: I am. Are you interested in physics?\nBernadette: Oh, I find it fascinating. If I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t gone into microbiology, I probably would have gone into physics. Or ice dancing.\nLeonard: Actually, my tests of the Aharonov-Bohm quantum interference effect have reached an interesting point. Right now, we\xe2\x80\x99re testing the phase shift due to an electric potential.\nBernadette: That\xe2\x80\x99s amazing.\nSheldon: Yes. Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s work is nearly as amazing as third graders growing lima beans in wet paper towels. (Raj whispers to him) While I appreciate the oh, snap, I\xe2\x80\x99m uncomfortable having your moist breath in my ear.\nBernadette: Are you going to try to set up the voltages using tunnel junctions?\nLeonard: Yes, I am. You want to see a simulation on my laptop?\nBernadette: Oh, yeah, show me. In microbiology, the most exciting thing I get to work with is yeast.\nSheldon: Howard?\nHoward: Yeah?\nSheldon: Your shoes are delightful. Where did you get them?\nHoward: What?\nSheldon: Bazinga. I don\xe2\x80\x99t care.\nScene: The apartment. Sheldon and Raj are playing a racing game on the Wii.\nRaj: Ha! Eat my dust, racially stereotypical plumber.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s not fair. I got stuck behind a tree.\nRaj: And a cow and a penguin. Face it dude, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s a real car or a virtual cartoon car, you can\xe2\x80\x99t drive.\nSheldon: Just need a little more practice.\nRaj: What you need is cheat codes, motor skills and a magic genie who grants wishes to little boys who suck at Mario Kart.\nPenny (knocking and entering): Hey, Sheldon, can I talk to you for a second?\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s not about shoes, is it? I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I could go through that again.\nPenny: It\xe2\x80\x99s not about shoes.\nSheldon: Then speak.\nPenny: Um, actually, can we do it in private?\nSheldon: All right. (To Raj) Go away. I agree, it\xe2\x80\x99s rude, but she asked for privacy.\nPenny: Thanks, Raj. Okay, so here\xe2\x80\x99s the thing, I was wondering if you could maybe teach me a little physics?\nSheldon: A little physics? There\xe2\x80\x99s no such thing. Physics encompasses the entire universe, from quantum particles to supernovas, from spinning electrons to spinning galaxies.\nPenny: Yeah, okay, cool. I don\xe2\x80\x99t need the PBS special, I just want to know enough so I can talk to Leonard about his job. You know, like Bernadette does.\nSheldon: Why can\xe2\x80\x99t Leonard teach you?\nPenny: \xe2\x80\x98Cause I want to surprise him.\nSheldon: Can\xe2\x80\x99t you surprise him in some other way? For example, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure he\xe2\x80\x99d be delightfully taken aback if you cleaned your apartment.\nPenny: Come on, Sheldon, this is important to me.\nSheldon: Penny, this would be a massive undertaking, and my time is both limited and valuable.\nPenny: You\xe2\x80\x99re sitting here playing video games all day.\nSheldon: Okay, point. What sort of foundation do you have? Did you take any science classes in school?\nPenny: Sure. I did the one with the frogs.\nSheldon: The one with the frogs.\nPenny: Yeah, actually, it was pretty cool. A lot of the girls threw up, but I gutted that thing like a deer.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, Penny, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think so.\nPenny: Oh, come on! A smart guy like you, it\xe2\x80\x99ll be a challenge. You can make it like an experiment.\nSheldon: Interesting. I suppose if someone could teach sign language to KoKo the gorilla, I could teach you some rudimentary physics.\nPenny: Great! It\xe2\x80\x99s a little insulting, but great. I\xe2\x80\x99ll be KoKo.\nSheldon: Not likely. KoKo learned to understand over 2,000 words, not one of which had anything to do with shoes.\nScene: The university cafeteria.\nHoward: Hey, fellas. This is my girlfriend Bernadette. My girlfriend Bernadette.\nBernadette: Who are all those people?\nHoward: Have no idea. Hey, Leonard.\nBernadette: Hi.\nLeonard: Hey, look, it\xe2\x80\x99s Howard and his girlfriend Bernadette.\nHoward: Thought I\xe2\x80\x99d give the little woman a tour of the old salt mines.\nBernadette: He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean salt mines. He means where he works.\nLeonard: Yeah, no, I got it.\nBernadette: So, how\xe2\x80\x99s your experiment going?\nLeonard: Ah, terrific. We\xe2\x80\x99re getting the electron accelerator set up. We should be ready to go day after tomorrow.\nBernadette: Boy, I\xe2\x80\x99d love to see that.\nLeonard: You\xe2\x80\x99re welcome to come.\nBernadette: Really? Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99d be great. How exciting is that?\nHoward: Like Hanukkah in July.\nBernadette: Do they have that?\nHoward: No.\nBernadette: Oh. You got me again. This isn\xe2\x80\x99t non-fat yogurt, this is fatty fat fat. Excuse me.\nHoward: Could you grab me another napkin, sweetie?\nBernadette: Sure.\nHoward: Thanks, honey. (She goes) All right, what is your deal?\nLeonard: Excuse me?\nHoward: Inviting my girlfriend to come see your electron accelerator?\nLeonard: Yeah? So?\nHoward: Wow! You really are a piece of work. It\xe2\x80\x99s not enough you get the prom queen, you have to get the head of the decorating committee, too?\nLeonard: What are you talking about?\nHoward: Don\xe2\x80\x99t play innocent with me. I practically invented using fancy lab equipment to seduce women.\nLeonard: Has it ever worked?\nHoward: Not so far, but that\xe2\x80\x99s not the point!\nLeonard: Howard, relax, I\xe2\x80\x99m not interested in your girlfriend.\nHoward: I hope not, because you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to mess with me. I\xe2\x80\x99m crazy.\nLeonard: I believe you.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Research journal, entry one. I\xe2\x80\x99m about to embark on one of the great challenges of my scientific career, teaching Penny physics. I\xe2\x80\x99m calling it Project Gorilla.\nPenny: Hey, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Come in. Take a seat. Subject has arrived. I\xe2\x80\x99ve extended a friendly casual greeting.\nPenny: Ready to get started?\nSheldon: One moment. Subject appears well-rested and enthusiastic. Apparently, ignorance is bliss. All right, let us begin. Where\xe2\x80\x99s your notebook?\nPenny: Um, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have one.\nSheldon: How are you going to take notes without a notebook?\nPenny: I have to take notes?\nSheldon: How else are you gonna study for the tests?\nPenny: There\xe2\x80\x99s gonna be a test?\nSheldon: Tests. Here. It\xe2\x80\x99s college-ruled. I hope that\xe2\x80\x99s not too intimidating.\nPenny: Thank you.\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re welcome. Now, Introduction to Physics. What is physics? Physics comes from the ancient Greek word physika. It\xe2\x80\x99s at this point that you\xe2\x80\x99ll want to start taking notes. Physika means the science of natural things. And it is there, in ancient Greece, that our story begins.\nPenny: Ancient Greece?\nSheldon: Hush. If you have questions, raise your hand. It\xe2\x80\x99s a warm summer evening, circa 600 BC, you\xe2\x80\x99ve finished your shopping at the local market, or agora, and you look up at the night sky. There you notice some of the stars seem to move, so you name them planetes, or wanderer. Yes, Penny?\nPenny: Um, does this have anything to do with Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s work?\nSheldon: This is the beginning of a twenty six hundred year journey we\xe2\x80\x99re going to take together from the ancient Greeks through Isaac Newton to Niels Bohr to Erwin Schrodinger to the Dutch researchers that Leonard is currently ripping off.\nPenny: Twenty six hundred years?\nSheldon: Yeah, give or take. As I was saying, it\xe2\x80\x99s a warm summer evening in ancient Greece\xe2\x80\xa6 Yes, Penny?\nPenny: I have to go to the bathroom.\nSheldon: Can\xe2\x80\x99t you hold it?\nPenny: Not for twenty six hundred years.\nSheldon: Project Gorilla, entry two. I am exhausted.\nScene: Howard\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom.\nBernadette: Howard?\nHoward: Huh?\nBernadette: It unhooks in the front.\nHoward: Oh, that explains a lot.\nHoward\xe2\x80\x99s Mother: Howard, I\xe2\x80\x99m home!\nHoward: Of course.\nHoward\xe2\x80\x99s Mother: Senior fitness was cancelled. It turns out you can forget how to ride a bike. I\xe2\x80\x99m fine, but, oy, did Sam Harpootian eat gravel.\nHoward: That\xe2\x80\x99s great, Ma!\nHoward\xe2\x80\x99s Mother: What\xe2\x80\x99s great about an 80-year-old Armenian man with half his chin scraped off?\nBernadette: I guess I should go.\nHoward: No, no, don\xe2\x80\x99t move. Hey, Ma, can I have lamb stew for dinner?\nHoward\xe2\x80\x99s Mother: Lamb stew? I\xe2\x80\x99d have to go to the supermarket.\nHoward: Please? I got a real hankering.\nHoward\xe2\x80\x99s Mother: Oh, I can\xe2\x80\x99t say no to my little tushy face. I\xe2\x80\x99ll be back soon.\nHoward: Thanks, Ma.\nHoward\xe2\x80\x99s Mother: Do you want the regular peas or the Le Seur?\nHoward: Always Le Seur peas with lamb stew!\nHoward\xe2\x80\x99s Mother: You\xe2\x80\x99re right! When you\xe2\x80\x99re right, you\xe2\x80\x99re right! What if they\xe2\x80\x99re out of the Le Seur?\nHoward: Then get the regular!\nHoward\xe2\x80\x99s Mother: All right! You don\xe2\x80\x99t have to yell!\nHoward: Sorry about that.\nBernadette (her phone chimes): Let me just put that on vibrate.\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m already on vibrate.\nBernadette: You know, that one I got. Howard, did you say something to Leonard about me?\nHoward: Uh, what do you mean?\nBernadette: He says if I go see his experiment tomorrow it might weird you out.\nHoward: Really? He said that?\nBernadette: You\xe2\x80\x99re not jealous of Leonard, are you?\nHoward: Me? No. I may have mentioned that it\xe2\x80\x99s a little inappropriate to be asking another man\xe2\x80\x99s girlfriend to his experiment without first discussing it with said man.\nBernadette: Are you saying I need to ask your permission to hang out with Leonard?\nHoward: I didn\xe2\x80\x99t say anything like that. I said Leonard has to ask my permission. (Bernadette storms out) Come on, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to eat lamb stew with my mother. Damn, I was this close on the bra.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Now, remember, Newton realized that Aristotle was wrong and force was not necessary to maintain motion. So let\xe2\x80\x99s plug in our 9.8 meters per second squared as A and we get force, Earth gravity, equals mass times 9.8 meters per second per second. So we can see that MA equals MG and what do we know from this?\nPenny: Uh, we know that\xe2\x80\xa6 Newton was a really smart cookie. Oh! Is that where Fig Newtons come from?\nSheldon: No, Fig Newtons are named after a small town in Massachusetts. Don\xe2\x80\x99t write that down!\nPenny: Sorry.\nSheldon: Now, if MA equals MG what does that imply?\nPenny: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\nSheldon: How can you not know? I just told you. Have you suffered a recent blow to the head?\nPenny: Hey! You don\xe2\x80\x99t have to be so mean!\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. (Smiling) Have you suffered a recent blow to the head?\nPenny: No, you just suck at teaching.\nSheldon: Really? Of those two explanations, which one seems the most likely?\nPenny: Oh, God, Sheldon, look I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to understand, but you\xe2\x80\x99re going too fast. Can you just back up a little bit?\nSheldon: All right. It\xe2\x80\x99s a warm summer evening in ancient Greece\xe2\x80\xa6\nPenny: Not that far back!\nSheldon: Okay! At what point did you begin to feel lost?\nPenny: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Where were we looking up at the night sky?\nSheldon: Greece.\nPenny: Damn it!\nSheldon: There\xe2\x80\x99s no need to get frustrated, people learn at different rates. Unlike objects falling in a vacuum, which\xe2\x80\xa6? MA equals MG?\nPenny: Squared?\nSheldon: No.\nPenny: Aristotle?\nSheldon: No.\nPenny: Five?\nSheldon: Oh!\nPenny: Then I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\nSheldon: Why are you crying?\nPenny: Because I\xe2\x80\x99m stupid!\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s no reason to cry. One cries because one is sad. For example, I cry because others are stupid and it makes me sad.\nPenny: Okay, look, can we just please forget about all this extra stuff and can you just tell me what Leonard does?\nSheldon: All right. Leonard is attempting to learn why sub-atomic particles move the way they do.\nPenny: Really? That\xe2\x80\x99s it? Well, that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t sound so complicated.\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s not. That\xe2\x80\x99s why Leonard does it.\nPenny: Okay, I just have one question. What exactly are sub-atomic particles?\nSheldon: A good question.\nPenny: Thank you.\nSheldon: And to answer it, we first must ask ourselves, what is physics?\nPenny: Oh, balls.\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s a warm summer evening in ancient Greece\xe2\x80\xa6\nScene: Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s lab.\nHoward: Okay, I got a bone to pick with you.\nLeonard: What did I do now?\nHoward: I was in bed with Bernadette, and you text-blocked me.\nLeonard: What?\nHoward: We were completely naked, about to devour each other when, you text her that I have a problem with her hanging out with you.\nLeonard: You do have a problem with her hanging out with me.\nHoward: Yeah, but that\xe2\x80\x99s not what you tell her.\nLeonard: What was I supposed to tell her?\nHoward: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, something that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make me come off as a petty, jealous douche.\nLeonard: And what would that be?\nHoward: Come on, do I have to think of everything?\nBernadette: Hey, Leonard. Am I too late to see the experiment? Oh, hi.\nHoward: Hi.\nBernadette: What are you doing here?\nHoward: Same thing you\xe2\x80\x99re doing here. I came to see Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s experiment.\nBernadette: No, you didn\xe2\x80\x99t. You said Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s experiment was stupid.\nLeonard: You told her my experiment was stupid?\nHoward: I was just repeating what Sheldon said. Let\xe2\x80\x99s not get off topic, Bernadette, I need to apologize. I was wrong to tell you who you should be friends with.\nLeonard: Should I, um, leave you two alone?\nBernadette: No, Leonard, you should hear this.\nLeonard: Okay, good, \xe2\x80\x99cause I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t really gonna go.\nHoward: Look, I know I come off as confident and worldly, but the truth is I\xe2\x80\x99m not.\nLeonard: We\xe2\x80\x99re shocked.\nHoward: Which is why I tend to feel threatened by other guys.\nLeonard: Or loud noises, clowns and nuns.\nHoward: But I now realize how foolish that is.\nLeonard: He had a panic attack once when he got his head stuck in a sweater.\nHoward: It was a full turtleneck. Why aren\xe2\x80\x99t you helping me?\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Maybe because I\xe2\x80\x99m crazy?\nHoward: Bernadette, please, I\xe2\x80\x99m asking you to give me another chance.\nBernadette: What do you think, Leonard? Should I give him another chance?\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s up to you. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t call your experiment stupid.\nBernadette: Come here, tushy face.\nLeonard: Tushy face, that is going on Twitter right now.\nScene: The apartment.\nBernadette: Raj, you should\xe2\x80\x99ve seen Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s experiment. The interference pattern was so cool when the electron beam was on.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m glad you enjoyed it. Most people aren\xe2\x80\x99t that interested in what I do.\nPenny: Actually, that\xe2\x80\x99s not true, Leonard. In fact, recently I\xe2\x80\x99ve been thinking that given the parameters of your experiment, the transport of electrons through the aperture the nano-fabricated metal rings is qualitatively no different than the experiment already conducted in the Netherlands. Their observed phase shift in the diffusing electrons inside the metal ring already conclusively demonstrated the electric analogue of the Aharonov-Bohm quantum-interference effect. That\xe2\x80\x99s it. That\xe2\x80\x99s all I know. Oh, wait! Fig Newtons were named after a town in Massachusetts, not the scientist.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
