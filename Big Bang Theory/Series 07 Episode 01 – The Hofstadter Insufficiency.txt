b'Scene: On the deck of a ship on the North Sea, in the middle of a storm. Leonard is on a sat-phone.\nLeonard: Sheldon, it\xe2\x80\x99s not a great time, what do you want?\nSheldon (in the apartment): Hello to you, too. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, but this is important.\nLeonard: What is it?\nSheldon: Back to the Future II was in the Back to the Future III case, and Back to the Future III was, get this, in the Back to the Future II case.\nLeonard: So?\nSheldon: So, did you do that, or am I in the house with an intruder?\nLeonard: Sheldon, I got to go inside. It\xe2\x80\x99s getting rough out here.\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re dodging the question, I knew it was you. What was that?\nLeonard: What was what?\nSheldon: This isn\xe2\x80\x99t a very good connection, but it sounded like someone just released a kraken.\nLeonard: Okay, I\xe2\x80\x99m hanging up now. You know there\xe2\x80\x99s no such thing as a k\xe2\x80\xa6 (Leonard is attacked and dragged into the sea by a huge tentacle. Sheldon wakes up in bed.)\nSheldon: No!\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment door.\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny.\nPenny: What\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\nSheldon: Um, well, I was worried that you might be missing Leonard. And that might be causing you to have bad dreams, like the kind you\xe2\x80\x99d get if you watched Clash of the Titans right before you went to bed.\nPenny: Sweetie, did you have a bad dream?\nSheldon: To be honest, I did.\nPenny: Aw.\nSheldon: Back to the Future II was in the Back to the Future III case. Leonard did it.\nPenny: Good night.\nSheldon: No, wait. Perhaps I should sleep here so you don\xe2\x80\x99t miss Leonard as much, uh, \xe2\x80\x99cause you\xe2\x80\x99re being kind of a baby about it.\nPenny: You know what? That would make me feel better. Thank you.\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re welcome. Good night.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The cafeteria.\nRaj: I think you\xe2\x80\x99d be pleased to hear that this morning in the parking garage I saw this oil stain on the ground that was shaped just like my ex-girlfriend, Lucy, and I didn\xe2\x80\x99t get upset at all.\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m proud of you.\nRaj: Well, you should be, \xe2\x80\x99cause she was looking good.\nSheldon: Dear Lord, you\xe2\x80\x99re an astronomer. Although you may have earthly woes, get your mind back on the stars. Gee, even the lowly dung beetle chooses to plot its course by using the Milky Way.\nRaj: Is that true?\nSheldon: Everything I say is true. Now, of course, the dung beetle also enjoys eating faeces, living in faeces and making little balls out of faeces, so, you know, pick and choose which aspects of its lifestyle you want to embrace.\nHoward: Come on, you can talk to girls now. It shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be hard for you to meet someone new.\nRaj: How can I meet someone new when everywhere I look, I see Lucy\xe2\x80\x99s face? Tell me you don\xe2\x80\x99t see her smile in the crust of this chicken pot pie.\nHoward: Oh, will you stop it. Now, listen to me, there\xe2\x80\x99s a welcome party for incoming post-docs tonight. Go to it and meet someone who isn\xe2\x80\x99t made of grease or pie.\nRaj: You think you\xe2\x80\x99re so cool because your wife is a person?\nHoward: Look, Bernie\xe2\x80\x99s at a neuroscience conference with Amy, I\xe2\x80\x99ll go with you.\nRaj: You would do that for me?\nHoward: Of course. You\xe2\x80\x99re my friend. I want you to be happy.\nRaj: Thanks. Oh, Sheldon, since Amy\xe2\x80\x99s out of town, would you like to join us?\nSheldon: I want you to be happy, too, but not enough to do anything about it.\nScene: A hotel room.\nBernadette (on phone): Howie, stop. I can\xe2\x80\x99t talk like that. Amy\xe2\x80\x99s right here.\nAmy (on phone): Sheldon, stop. For the last time, I will not bring home bed bugs.\nBernadette: The hotel\xe2\x80\x99s nice. There\xe2\x80\x99s a pool, a gym, the bar looks like fun.\nAmy: Because I looked in the bed, and there are no bugs.\nBernadette: Aw, I love you, too. If I don\xe2\x80\x99t talk to you before you go to sleep, I\xe2\x80\x99ll meet you in dreamland.\nAmy: Good night. No, I will not consider sleeping in my garment bag.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Penny, did you ever wonder how Starfleet captains\xe2\x80\xa6\nPenny: No.\nSheldon: Well, now that I\xe2\x80\x99ve piqued your interest, welcome to the exciting world of 3D chess.\nPenny: Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you just admit you only want to play this game because you always play it with Leonard and you miss him?\nSheldon: You overestimate his significance in my life.\nPenny: Mmm.\nSheldon: Do I miss how he makes a face on my toaster waffle with syrup? No. Do I miss the way he fixes the zipper on my jacket when it gets stuck? I don\xe2\x80\x99t think so. Do I miss how we say good night to each other through the walls of our bedroom using Morse code? (Taps out No in morse code on the table)\nPenny: Okay, I get it, I get it. You are an emotionless robot.\nSheldon: Well, I try.\nPenny: All right, let\xe2\x80\x99s just get this stupid game over with.\nSheldon: Great. I\xe2\x80\x99ll go first.\nPenny: Okay.\nSheldon: By the way, how are you with zippers?\nPenny: Why?\nSheldon: Well, I really need to go to the bathroom, and this one\xe2\x80\x99s gone all cattywampus.\nScene: The mixer party.\nRaj: Wow, your work on jellyfish neural nets sounds so interesting.\nGirl: It is. You can download my paper off the university server.\nRaj: I will. You can download my paper on the Van Allen Belts from the university server as well.\nGirl: I will.\nRaj: All right.\nHoward: How\xe2\x80\x99d it go?\nRaj: Well, if you like dry, factual statements interspersed with painful moments of silence, it was bananas.\nHoward: Check it out. Mrs. Davis from Human Resources is here. She\xe2\x80\x99s probably on the lookout for sexual harassment.\nRaj: Oh, great. There go my chances of being sexually harassed.\nHoward: I heard her husband left her for a hot, young undergrad.\nRaj: That\xe2\x80\x99s so much better than the old, ugly ones.\nMrs Davis: Mr. Wolowitz, Dr. Koothrappali.\nHoward: Mrs. Davis, nice to see you.\nRaj: You know, I recently read a fascinating article on infidelity among penguins.\nMrs Davis: Okay.\nRaj: So if the fact that your husband left you makes you feel unattractive, just remember, penguins get cheated on, and they\xe2\x80\x99re adorable.\nHoward: It was better when you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t talk to women.\nScene: The hotel bar.\nBernadette: I was thinking of going to the lecture on posterior cingulate cortex lesions in the formation of autobiographical memory.\nAmy: Oh, brain lesions are fascinating. Unless they\xe2\x80\x99re yours, then they\xe2\x80\x99re a drag.\nBernadette: To the advancement of science.\nAmy: And to the sick and dying who make it possible.\nBernadette: This is fun, we never really get to talk shop with Penny around. We usually just end up talking about boys.\nAmy: Which is fine, but it\xe2\x80\x99s nice to mix it up with a little intellectual conversation.\nWaiter: From the two gentlemen at the bar.\nAmy: Oh, my gosh, boys bought us drinks, boys bought us drinks. Thank you, thank you, thank you so much.\nBernadette: Be cool.\nAmy: You be cool. Guys are hitting on us, and not just to get to Penny.\nBernadette: You\xe2\x80\x99re right. Thank you.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Ooh. Bad move.\nPenny: Really? Why?\nSheldon: My queen can now take your rook from below.\nPenny: So that means I lose, right? It\xe2\x80\x99s over?\nSheldon: If I make this move, but I won\xe2\x80\x99t because we\xe2\x80\x99re having too much fun.\nPenny: Okay, let\xe2\x80\x99s take a break.\nSheldon: We\xe2\x80\x99re all out of alcohol.\nPenny: I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to get alcohol. Gosh, I wonder what Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s doing right now. I miss him so much.\nSheldon: Well, if you\xe2\x80\x99d like, we could call him. I mean that you could call him. As I\xe2\x80\x99ve explained, the absence of my friends does not cause me pain. As rock and roll bad boy Paul Simon once said, I am a rock, I am an i-i-i-island.\nPenny: I\xe2\x80\x99m calling him.\nSheldon: Oh, goodie, put him on speaker phone.\nLeonard (on board boat, at a party, dancing): Excuse me, ladies, my pants are buzzing. North Sea, how can I kelp you?\nPenny: Leonard?\nLeonard: Penny? Hey, it\xe2\x80\x99s Penny. Everybody say hi to Penny.\nEverybody: Hi, Penny!\nPenny: Wow, it sounds like you\xe2\x80\x99re having a good time.\nLeonard: Best time of my life.\nSheldon: Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it five thirty in the morning there?\nLeonard: Is it? Hey, everybody, it\xe2\x80\x99s five thirty in the morning!\nPenny: Uh, okay, well, we were just calling you because we were missing you.\nRandom voice: Iceberg!\nLeonard: Uh-oh, hang on.\nSheldon: Are you in danger?\nLeonard: No, it\xe2\x80\x99s a drinking game. Whenever we see an iceberg, we take a shot!\nEverybody: Berg! Berg! Berg! Berg! Berg! Berg!\nPenny: Leonard, Leonard? I cannot believe we were missing that jerk.\nSheldon: You were.\nScene: The hotel bar.\nAmy: So what happened? How\xe2\x80\x99d it go?\nBernadette: It\xe2\x80\x99s fine. I thanked them again and let them know we\xe2\x80\x99re not available.\nAmy: So I can drink this without having to give up the goodies?\nBernadette: Yes, it\xe2\x80\x99s all cool. Although, if you wanted to talk to one of them, no one would blame you.\nAmy: And why would no one blame me?\nBernadette: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what I\xe2\x80\x99m saying.\nAmy: Well, it sounds like you\xe2\x80\x99re saying that I could do better than Sheldon.\nBernadette: Boy, these drinks are strong. Hoo, mama, I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna be huggin\xe2\x80\x99 the toilet tonight.\nAmy: No, tell me, I want to know what you meant by that.\nBernadette: I just meant that you\xe2\x80\x99re not married and your boyfriend\xe2\x80\x99s kind of, Sheldon.\nAmy: And your husband is extremely Howard. What\xe2\x80\x99s your point?\nBernadette: Sorry. I have no point. That was a stupid thing to say. Can we please just go back to having a nice time?\nAmy: We could, but unfortunately my brain is lesion-free and I remember that rotten thing you just said about my sweet baboo.\nBernadette: Come on. I apologize. Can we please just let it go?\nAmy: Sure.\nBernadette: Thanks.\nAmy: Your husband\xe2\x80\x99s weird and his clothes are ridiculous.\nScene: The apartment.\nPenny: I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe it. All this time I\xe2\x80\x99ve been doing nothing but sit around and miss that guy. And you know what the worst part is?\nSheldon: That you\xe2\x80\x99re having to process your emotional pain without vodka?\nPenny: No. Yeah. But you know what the second-worst part is? He does not miss me at all.\nSheldon: Allow me to comfort you. At least you\xe2\x80\x99ve got your health.\nPenny: Really? That, that\xe2\x80\x99s it? That\xe2\x80\x99s comforting?\nSheldon: Um, uh, in a hundred years, you\xe2\x80\x99ll both be dead and it won\xe2\x80\x99t matter?\nPenny: No. Come on, you\xe2\x80\x99re supposed to say, of course he misses you, the only reason he\xe2\x80\x99s partying is to cover up his pain.\nSheldon: Oh, no, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x99s true at all.\nPenny: This is ridiculous. Why am I upset just because he\xe2\x80\x99s off having a good time?\nSheldon: Well, perhaps you\xe2\x80\x99re obsessively picturing him engaged in drunken coitus with another woman. Is that it? Did I get it right?\nPenny: Okay, that, that\xe2\x80\x99s great. You can stop trying to make me feel better now.\nSheldon: Actually, I can\xe2\x80\x99t. Before Leonard left, he made me promise that I\xe2\x80\x99d take care of you.\nPenny: He did?\nSheldon: Yes.\nPenny: Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s really sweet.\nSheldon: Plus, if I do a good job, he said he\xe2\x80\x99d bring me back a sailor\xe2\x80\x99s cap.\nPenny: Well, now I miss him even more.\nSheldon: Well, if it\xe2\x80\x99s any consolation, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s tormented every moment he\xe2\x80\x99s away from your warm embrace and cherry lips.\nPenny: Thanks.\nSheldon: Oh, seriously?\nScene: The mixer.\nRaj: Uh, excuse me, Mrs. Davis?\nMrs Davis: What?\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99d like to apologize for being insensitive. And for possibly making penguins seem like jerks, because 99% of them are stand-up guys.\nMrs Davis: Forget about it.\nRaj: You know, you, you and I, you and I have a lot in common.\nMrs Davis: Is that right?\nRaj: Oh, yes, I, I too am in the throes of heartbreak. Okay, fine, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you about it.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Here is a hot beverage to comfort you. It\xe2\x80\x99s in a to-go cup. Make of that what you will.\nPenny: Come on. It\xe2\x80\x99s still early. Let\xe2\x80\x99s do something.\nSheldon: Well, I have been toying around with an idea for 4D chess.\nPenny: How about we just talk?\nSheldon: All right. In 4D chess\xe2\x80\xa6\nPenny: No. Come on, let\xe2\x80\x99s talk about our lives. Tell me something about you I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\nSheldon: I own nine pairs of pants.\nPenny: Okay, that, that\xe2\x80\x99s a good start, but I was thinking maybe something a little more personal.\nSheldon: I see. I own nine pairs of underpants.\nPenny: How about I go first?\nSheldon: But I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to know how many underpants you own. Although, based on the floor of your bedroom, I\xe2\x80\x99d say it\xe2\x80\x99s a thousand.\nPenny: Okay, look, here\xe2\x80\x99s something people do not know about me. When I first moved out to L.A., I did a topless scene in a low-budget horror movie about a killer gorilla. Ugh! After I did it, I felt so ashamed. Thankfully, that thing never came out.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen that. Yeah. Serial Apeist. Howard found it online the day we met you.\nPenny: Oh, God.\nSheldon: And it was literally the moment you walked out the door. But I see the type of personal revelations you\xe2\x80\x99re going for. Okay, here\xe2\x80\x99s one I thought I\xe2\x80\x99d take to the grave.\nPenny: Okay.\nSheldon: Hmm. A while back, YouTube changed its user interface from a star-based rating system to a thumbs-up rating system. I tell people I\xe2\x80\x99m okay with it, but I\xe2\x80\x99m really not.\nPenny: That\xe2\x80\x99s your big revelation?\nSheldon: Yes. Whew, I feel ten pounds lighter.\nPenny: Okay, you know what? I give up. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to bed.\nSheldon: Here\xe2\x80\x99s something else you don\xe2\x80\x99t know about me. You just hurt my feelings.\nPenny: What did I do?\nSheldon: I opened up and shared something deeply upsetting to me, and you treated it as if it were nothing.\nPenny: I, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t think it was a big deal.\nSheldon: It is to me; that\xe2\x80\x99s the point.\nPenny: Sheldon, you are right. I\xe2\x80\x99m really sorry. I should\xe2\x80\x99ve known better.\nSheldon: Your apology is accepted.\nPenny: Thank you. How about a hug?\nSheldon: How about a hearty handshake?\nPenny: Come on.\nSheldon: Now I know how you felt getting mauled by that sex-crazed gorilla.\nScene: The hotel room.\nBernadette: Good night.\nAmy: Mm-hmm. It was rather flattering to have strangers send us drinks.\nBernadette: Yeah, that felt nice.\nAmy: Maybe tomorrow morning we put on some hot pants and see if we can score us some free omelettes.\nBernadette: So, hypothetically, if, if we were to have gone with them, which one would you have picked?\nAmy: I think I would have gone with the short one with the goofy haircut.\nBernadette: Oh, good, \xe2\x80\x99cause I liked the tall thin one. He seemed intelligent, kind of a loner, maybe a little sexually inexperienced, like I\xe2\x80\x99d have to teach him a thing or two.\nAmy: Not my guy. I caught him staring at my rack. It\xe2\x80\x99d be nice to be with a man who wants to know what\xe2\x80\x99s underneath my cardigan. FYI, it\xe2\x80\x99s another cardigan.\nBernadette: Your short sexed-up guy kind of sounds like Howard.\nAmy: Your brainy virgin kind of sounds like Sheldon.\nBoth: Good night.\nScene: The mixer.\nMrs Davis: All right, Dr. Koothrappali, it\xe2\x80\x99s been nice talking to you, but I need to go home and relieve my babysitter.\nRaj: Yeah, I can relate to being a single parent. I have a dog.\nMrs Davis: Yeah, it\xe2\x80\x99s exactly the same thing. Good night.\nRaj: Mrs. Davis, I, uh, I must confess, I came here tonight in a futile attempt to pick up some lonely postdoc, but instead I got to connect with you at a human level. That\xe2\x80\x99s a much better evening. You\xe2\x80\x99re a lovely person.\nMrs Davis: Are you hitting on me?\nRaj: No, no, no, that would be crazy. I mean, if I were hitting on you, you\xe2\x80\x99d know it \xe2\x80\x99cause you\xe2\x80\x99d feel uncomfortable and a little sad for me.\nMrs Davis: You\xe2\x80\x99re sweet. Good night, Dr. Koothrappali.\nRaj: Good night.\nHoward: Looks like she accepted your apology.\nRaj: And then some. I think we had a moment.\nHoward: Oh, please, you did not have a moment.\nRaj: Who died and made you king of moments?\nHoward: Okay, fine. Let\xe2\x80\x99s say there was a moment.\nRaj: There was.\nHoward: There wasn\xe2\x80\x99t. But, but even if there was, what are you gonna do about it?\nRaj: I will slowly seduce her until she falls helpless into my bed, hungry for the pleasure only I can give her.\nHoward: So nothing.\nRaj: No, not a thing.\nScene: A bathroom shower.\nPenny (acting): Ah, I\xe2\x80\x99m so glad the police finally caught that psychotic genetically engineered ape.\nLeonard (on ship): That is my girlfriend. I swear to God.\nEveryone (on ship): Leonard! Leonard! Leonard! Leonard!\nPenny: Aaaaaaah!\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
