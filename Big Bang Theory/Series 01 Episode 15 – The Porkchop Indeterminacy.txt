b'Scene: A corridor at the University.\nLeonard: On the other hand, some physicists are concerned that if the super collider actually works, it will create a black hole and swallow up the Earth ending life as we know it.\nRaj: Psh, what a bunch of crybabies. No guts, no glory man.\nLeonard (looking at an orange notice on the noticeboard): Hey, check it out, the school of pharmacology is looking for volunteers.\nRaj: We are testing a new medication for social anxiety, panic attacks, agoraphobia and obsessive compulsive disorder. Why would they be looking for test subjects here?\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, Raj. Maybe the comic book store doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have a bulletin board. (Sees crowds in the corridor) What\xe2\x80\x99s going on?\nHoward: Shhh! Hot girl in Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s office.\nLeonard: Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s office? Is she lost?\nHoward: Don\xe2\x80\x99t think so. I followed her here from the parking lot.\nLeonard: Maybe she\xe2\x80\x99s his lawyer.\nHoward: Well she\xe2\x80\x99s free to examine my briefs.\nLeonard: Howard\xe2\x80\xa6\nHoward: I know, I\xe2\x80\x99m disgusting, I should be punished. By her, oh look, I did it again.\nGirl: Well, that should do it.\nSheldon: Thank you for coming by. (He rises from his desk. Everyone rushes to look nonchalant.) Hello.\nLeonard: Oh, hey buddy.\nSheldon: Buddy.\nHoward: Sorry I\xe2\x80\x99m late, I\xe2\x80\x99m working on a project that may take me up on the next space shuttle.\nSheldon: How can you be late, I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t expecting you at all.\nHoward: Nobody ever expects me, sometimes you just look and\xe2\x80\xa6 BAM! (shakes girl\xe2\x80\x99s hand) Howard Wolowitz.\nLeonard: Sheldon, are you going to introduce us?\nSheldon: Oh, alright, this is Missy, Missy this is Leonard and Rajesh and you\xe2\x80\x99ve already met Howard.\nMissy: It\xe2\x80\x99s nice to meet you.\nLeonard: You too, swell, also.\nHoward: Yeah.\nLeonard: So, how do you two know each other.\nMissy: Oh, he once spent nine months with my legs wrapped around his head.\nLeonard: Excuse me?\nSheldon: She\xe2\x80\x99s my twin sister, she thinks she\xe2\x80\x99s funny but frankly I\xe2\x80\x99ve never been able to see it.\nMissy: It\xe2\x80\x99s because you have no measurable sense of humour, Shelly.\nSheldon: How exactly would one measure a sense of humour? A humourmometer?\nHoward: Well, I think you\xe2\x80\x99re delightfully droll. Or as the French say, Tres Drole.\nMissy: Okay, so let me see if I got this. Leonard, Howard and\xe2\x80\xa6 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry what was your name again. (Raj looks uncomfortable, turns and walks away, disappears round corner. He then reappears, takes the orange paper from the noticeboard and leaves again.)\nSheldon: Rajesh.\nCredits sequence\nScene: The same.\nLeonard: So Missy, what brings you all the way from Texas?\nHoward: Was it perhaps destiny, I think it was destiny.\nMissy: My friend\xe2\x80\x99s getting married in Disneyland tomorrow night.\nHoward: Destiny, thy name is Anaheim.\nMissy: And I had to drop off some papers for Shelly to sign for my dad\xe2\x80\x99s estate.\nSheldon: The papers could have been mailed, Mom just sent you here to spy on me, didn\xe2\x80\x99t she.\nMissy: I guess that\xe2\x80\x99s why they call you a genius.\nSheldon: They call me a genius because I\xe2\x80\x99m a genius. Tell Mom that I currently weigh 165 pounds, and that I\xe2\x80\x99m having regular bowel movements. Enjoy the wedding, goodbye.\nLeonard and Howard together: Woah, woah.\nLeonard: If the wedding\xe2\x80\x99s not until tomorrow, why don\xe2\x80\x99t you stay with us tonight?\nMissy: Oh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think so. Shelly doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like company. Even as a little boy he\xe2\x80\x99d send his imaginary friends home at the end of the day.\nSheldon: They were not friends, they were imaginary colleagues.\nLeonard: Look, you\xe2\x80\x99re here, we have plenty of room.\nSheldon: No we don\xe2\x80\x99t.\nHoward: Come on, Shelly, she\xe2\x80\x99s family.\nSheldon: So what? I don\xe2\x80\x99t issue invitations to your mother.\nMissy: Well it would be nice not to have to drive out to Anaheim in rush hour.\nSheldon: And don\xe2\x80\x99t ever call me Shelly.\nLeonard: So it\xe2\x80\x99s settled. You\xe2\x80\x99ll stay with us.\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99ll walk you to your car. You\xe2\x80\x99re in structure 3 level C, right?\nSheldon: What just happened?\nScene: The apartment.\nMissy: So anyway, we\xe2\x80\x99re eight years old, and Sheldon converts my easy-bake oven to some kind of high-powered furnace.\nLeonard: Hee-hee, just classic.\nSheldon: I needed a place to fire ceramic semi-conductor substrates for home-made integrated circuits.\nMissy: He was trying to build some kind of armed robot to keep me out of his room.\nSheldon: Made necessary by her insistence on going into my room.\nMissy: Anyway, I go to make those little corn muffins they give you, there\xe2\x80\x99s a big flash, next thing you know my eyebrows are gone.\nHoward: Ha-ha, not your eyebrows?\nMissy: Yep. I had to go through the entire second grade with crooked eyebrows my Mom drew on.\nSheldon: Is that what that was? I just assumed that the second grade curriculum had rendered you quizzical.\nPenny (knocking and entering, holding up a pair of superman undershorts.): Hey, Leonard, you left your underwear in the dryer downstairs.\nLeonard: Those are not mine.\nPenny: Really, they have your little name label in them.\nLeonard: Yeah, no, I do, I use those\xe2\x80\xa6 uh\xe2\x80\xa6 just to polish up my\xe2\x80\xa6 spear-fishing equipment. I spear fish. When I\xe2\x80\x99m not crossbow hunting, I spear fish. Uh, Penny, this is Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s twin sister, Missy. Missy, this is our neighbour Penny.\nMissy: Hi.\nPenny: Wow, you don\xe2\x80\x99t look that much alike.\nHoward: Can I get a hallelujah.\nSheldon: Fraternal twins come from two separate eggs, they are no more alike than any other siblings.\nHoward: Hallelujah.\nRaj (running in): Hey, guess what. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been accepted as a test subject for a new miracle drug to overcome pathological shyness.\nPenny: Hey, good for you, Raj.\nRaj: Yes, I\xe2\x80\x99m very hopeful. Hello Missy. (He waves his hand. It keeps waving.) They mentioned there may be side effects.\nScene: The same, later.\nRaj: So, Missy. Have you ever met a man from the exotic subcontinent of India?\nMissy: Well, there\xe2\x80\x99s Dr Patel at our church.\nRaj: Ah yes, Dr Patel, good man.\nHoward: Do you like motorcycles, \xe2\x80\x98cos I ride a hog.\nRaj: A hog? You have a two cylinder scooter with a basket on the front.\nHoward: You still have to wear a helmet.\nRaj: Have you ever heard of the Kama Sutra?\nMissy: The sex book?\nRaj: The Indian sex book. In other words if you wonder wonder who wrote the book of love, it was us.\nPenny (to Leonard): Hey, Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s sister\xe2\x80\x99s pretty cute, I w\xe2\x80\xa6.\nLeonard: I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t staring!\nPenny: I didn\xe2\x80\x99t say you were, I just said she was cute.\nLeonard: Oh. Huh, um, maybe, if you like women who are tall\xe2\x80\xa6 and perfect.\nPenny: Sheldon, why are you ignoring your sister?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m not ignoring my sister. I\xe2\x80\x99m ignoring all of you.\nLeonard: I brought snacks.\nMissy: Oh my! Gherkins and\xe2\x80\xa6.\nLeonard: Onion dip, it\xe2\x80\x99s onion dip.\nMissy: Oh.\nLeonard: We don\xe2\x80\x99t entertain much.\nRaj: Missy, do you enjoy pajamas?\nMissy: I guess.\nRaj: We Indians invented them. You\xe2\x80\x99re welcome.\nHoward: Yeah, well my people invented circumcision. You\xe2\x80\x99re welcome!\nPenny: Missy, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to go get my nails done. Do you want to come?\nMissy: God yes. Thanks.\nPenny: You\xe2\x80\x99re welcome.\nMissy: Bye guys.\nHoward: Bye Missy.\nLeonard: Bye Missy, see you.\nPenny: Goodbye Leonard!\nLeonard: Uh, yeah, no, uh, bye Penny.\nHoward: Okay, you two have to back off.\nRaj: Why should I back off, you back off dude.\nLeonard: Excuse me, this is my apartment and she\xe2\x80\x99s my roommate\xe2\x80\x99s sister.\nHoward: So what, you\xe2\x80\x99ve already got Penny.\nLeonard: How do I have Penny? In what universe do I have Penny?\nHoward: So I can have Penny?\nLeonard: Hell, no!\nSheldon: Excuse me, can I interject something. I\xe2\x80\x99m ordering pizza online, is everyone okay with pepperoni?\nLeonard: Sheldon, can I talk to you in private?\nSheldon: I guess. Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry, I was going to order you cheeseless.\nLeonard: Thank you.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s okay. Lactose intolerance is nothing to be embarrassed about.\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m a fancy Indian man, we invented pajamas!\nRaj: Hey, look at me, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a foreskin.\nScene: Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom.\nLeonard: Sheldon, are you aware that your sister is an incredibly attractive woman?\nSheldon: Hmmm? She certainly has the symmetry and low body fat that western culture deems desirable. It\xe2\x80\x99s noteworth that at other points in history, heavier women were the standard for beauty because their girth suggested affluence.\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99s fascinating, but I\xe2\x80\xa6\nSheldon: I didn\xe2\x80\x99t say it was fascinating, I said it was noteworthy.\nLeonard: Alright, noted. But my point is that Koothrappali and Wolowitz\xe2\x80\xa6 they\xe2\x80\x99re hitting on your sister.\nSheldon: Oh. Okay. You know, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to criticise your rhetorical style but, we\xe2\x80\x99d be a lot further along in this conversation if you\xe2\x80\x99d begun with that thought.\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99s great, but I\xe2\x80\xa6.\nSheldon: What I\xe2\x80\x99m saying is that we took quite an unnecessary detour from what I now understand to be your thesis.\nLeonard: Whatever. You have to do something about it.\nSheldon: Why?\nLeonard: Because she\xe2\x80\x99s your sister.\nSheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand. Yes, we shared a uterus for nine months, but since then we\xe2\x80\x99ve pretty much gone our own separate ways.\nLeonard: Okay, uh\xe2\x80\xa6. oh, consider this. With your father gone, it is your responsibility to make sure that Missy chooses a suitable mate.\nSheldon: I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t considered that. We do share DNA.\nLeonard: Uh-huh.\nSheldon: So there is the possibility, however remote, that resting in her loins is the potential for another individual as remarkable as myself.\nLeonard: Exactly. And, you owe it to yourself and to posterity to protect the genetic integrity of your sister\xe2\x80\x99s future offspring.\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re right. If someone wants to get at Missy\xe2\x80\x99s fallopian tubes, they\xe2\x80\x99ll have to go through me.\nScene: The living room. Raj and Howard are on the floor, fighting.\nRaj: I am Shiva the destroyer, I will have the woman!\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m warning you, I was judo champion at math camp.\nSheldon: Alright, that\xe2\x80\x99s enough juvenile squabbling, stop it, stop it I say. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to settle this right now. Neither of you are good enough for my sister.\nHoward: Who are you to decide that?\nLeonard: He\xe2\x80\x99s the man of his family, you have to respect his wishes.\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re out too, by the way.\nLeonard: Say what?\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s nothing personal, I\xe2\x80\x99d just prefer if my future niece or nephew didn\xe2\x80\x99t become flatulent every time they eat an Eskimo pie.\nHoward (to Raj, who is smiling): What are you so happy about?\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99m not happy, it\xe2\x80\x99s the medication, I can\xe2\x80\x99t stop smiling. (Waves hand at mouth. It keeps waving.)\nSheldon: Now that Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s made me aware of how high the genetic stakes are, we have to face the fact that none of you are suitable mates for my sister.\nHoward: Wait a minute. Leonard made you aware of that?\nLeonard: We all make mistakes, let\xe2\x80\x99s move on.\nRaj: Excuse me, but I think you\xe2\x80\x99re missing a big opportunity here.\nSheldon: How so?\nRaj: Everybody knows genetic diversity produces the strongest offspring. Why not put a little mocha in the family latte.\nSheldon: In principle you have a point, but as a practical matter, need I remind you that it takes experimental pharmaceuticals to simply enable you to speak to the opposite sex.\nRaj (waving finger at him): I think you\xe2\x80\x99re focussing entirely too much on the drugs. (Finger keeps waving. Leonard has to reach out and stop it.)\nHoward: Is it \xe2\x80\x98cause I\xe2\x80\x99m Jewish, \xe2\x80\x98cause I\xe2\x80\x99d kill my Rabbi with a porkchop to be with your sister.\nSheldon: This has nothing to do with religion. This has to do with the fact that you\xe2\x80\x99re a tiny, tiny man who still lives with his mother.\nLeonard: Sheldon, you are really being unreasonable.\nSheldon: Am I? Here. Eat this cheese without farting and you can sleep with my sister.\nMissy (who has just entered): Oh really?\nSheldon: Oops.\nMissy: Shelly, can I speak to you for a minute? Alone?\nSheldon: Why does everyone suddenly want to talk to me alone? Usually nobody wants to be alone with me.   \nLeonard (to Penny who is standing next to him grinning): We all make mistakes, let\xe2\x80\x99s move on.\nScene: Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom.\nMissy: Okay. I\xe2\x80\x99m not even going to ask why you\xe2\x80\x99re pimping me out for cheese. But since when do you care at all about who I sleep with?\nSheldon: Truthfully, I\xe2\x80\x99ve never given it any thought, but it has been pointed out to me that you carry DNA of great potential.\nMissy: What on earth are you talking about?\nSheldon: Let me explain. You see, I\xe2\x80\x99m a superior genetic mutation, an improvement on the existing mediocre stock.\nMissy: And what do you mean, mediocre stock?\nSheldon: That would be you. But residing within you is the potential for another me. Perhaps even taller, smarter and less prone to freckling, a Sheldon 2.0 if you will.\nMissy: Sheldon 2.0?\nSheldon: Exactly. Now, I am not saying that I should be the sole decider of who you mate with. If you\xe2\x80\x99re not attracted to the suitor then the likelihood of conception would be reduced.\nMissy: You have got to be kidding me!\nSheldon: Not at all. Frequent coitus dramatically increases the odds of fertiliziation.\nMissy: Okay Shelly, sit down. Now I\xe2\x80\x99ve lived my whole life dealing with the fact that my twin brother is, as Mom puts it, one of God\xe2\x80\x99s special little people.\nSheldon: I always thought I was more like a cuckoo bird. You know, a superior creature whose egg is placed in the nest of ordinary birds. Of course the newly hatched cuckoo eats all the food, leaving the ordinary siblings to starve to death. Luckily for you, that\xe2\x80\x99s where the metaphor ended.\nMissy: I thought it ended at cuckoo. Now you listen to me, if you want to start acting like a brother who cares about me, then terrific. Bring it on. But you try one time to tell me who I should be sleeping with, and you and I are going to go round and round the way we did when we were little. Remember? (Sheldon hurriedly crosses his legs.)\nSheldon: I have an alternate proposal.\nMissy: Go on.\nSheldon: You donate eggs. We will place them in cryogenic storage. I will find an appropriate sperm donor for your eggs, have them fertilized and implanted in you, that way everybody wins.\nScene: The living room. Sheldon enters limping, holding his groin area.\nSheldon: Correction. Missy can date whoever she wants.\nScene: The same, later.\nHoward: Look, we have to settle this.\nLeonard: I agree. Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s sister is hiding at Penny\xe2\x80\x99s because we\xe2\x80\x99ve all been hitting on her at the same time.\nRaj: She\xe2\x80\x99s not hiding. She needed privacy to call her grandmother who\xe2\x80\x99s apparently very sick. Oh, and then I believe she has to wash her hair.\nHoward: Oh, you poor, deluded bastard.\nRaj: Don\xe2\x80\x99t start with me dude.\nHoward: You want to go again? Let\xe2\x80\x99s go.\nLeonard: Sit down.\nHoward: Okay.\nLeonard: If we\xe2\x80\x99re going to fight over Missy, let\xe2\x80\x99s do it the right way. The honourable way.\n(Time shift. Sheldon enters to hear sounds of fighting. It becomes apparent that the guys are playing a boxing game on a Nintendo Wii.)\nLeonard: And he\xe2\x80\x99s down!\nHoward: Come on, come on, get up.\nLeonard: Stay down, bitch. Yeah, ha ha, natural selection at work.\nSheldon: I weep for humanity.\nLeonard: Excuse me while I go tell Missy the good news. (Leaves and knocks on Penny\xe2\x80\x99s door.)\nPenny (answering): Ah, hey Leonard.\nLeonard: Hi Penny, how\xe2\x80\x99s it going. Listen, that guy Mike that you were dating, is that still going on?\nPenny: Uh, pretty much, why?\nLeonard: Nothing, just catching up. By the way, may I speak to Missy please?\nPenny: Of course.\nMissy: Hi, Leonard, what\xe2\x80\x99s up?\nLeonard: Well, since you\xe2\x80\x99re leaving tomorrow I was wondering if you\xe2\x80\x99d like to go out to dinner with me?\nMissy: That\xe2\x80\x99s so sweet. But no thanks.\nLeonard: Oh. You have other plans, or\xe2\x80\xa6?\nMissy: No.\nLeonard: Oh. Alright uh\xe2\x80\xa6 enjoy the rest of your evening.\nMissy: Thanks. See you.\nLeonard (returning): Um, here\xe2\x80\x99s something we didn\xe2\x80\x99t anticipate.\n(Time shift. Penny opens door to Howard.)\nPenny: What do you want, Howard?\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m fine, thanks for asking. I\xe2\x80\x99ve come to call on Missy.\nPenny: Missy?\nMissy: Hi Howard.\nHoward: The amazing Howard. Do you like magic?\nMissy: Not really. No.\nHoward: Then you are in for a treat. Behold, an ordinary cane. (Taps against doorpost. While humming he tries to perform a trick, but the cane falls in half with a yellow handkerchief flying out. Howard has to retrieve the pieces.) Da-dah! (Emerges with the handkerchief, on which are written the words \xe2\x80\x9cwill you go out with me?\xe2\x80\x9d)\nMissy: No.\nHoward: Okay. (Does something with hands, from which another yellow handkerchief emerges. This one reads \xe2\x80\x9care you sure?\xe2\x80\x9d Missy closes the door.)\n(Time shift. Penny opens the door to Raj.)\nPenny: Missy?\nRaj: Thank you. I apprec\xe2\x80\xa6. (looks panicked) apprec\xe2\x80\xa6. appreeee\xe2\x80\xa6. oh-oh.\nPenny: Oh, honey, is your medication wearing off?  (Raj nods.)\nMissy: Oh, hi, cutie pie. I was hoping you\xe2\x80\x99d show up.\n(Raj attempts to speak. All that emerges is a high pitched wail. After a few more attempts he turns and leaves down the stairs, still making the same sound.)\nMissy: We had a dog who made a noise like that. Had to put him down.\nScene: The stairwell. Missy and Sheldon are descending.\nMissy: Any news you want me to pass along to Mom?\nSheldon: Well, she might be interested to know that I have refocused my research from bosonic string theory to heteronic string theory.\nMissy: Yeah, I\xe2\x80\x99ll just tell her you said hey.\nSheldon: Okay, well, it was pleasant seeing you, other than that business with my testicles. (Holds out hand to shake.)\nMissy: Come on, Shelly. (Hugs him. He looks uncomfortable, then hugs back half heartedly.) I want you to know I\xe2\x80\x99m very proud of you.\nSheldon: Really?\nMissy: Yup, I\xe2\x80\x99m always bragging to my friends about my brother the rocket scientist.\nSheldon: You tell people I\xe2\x80\x99m a rocket scientist?\nMissy: Well yeah.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m a theoretical physicist.\nMissy: What\xe2\x80\x99s the difference?\nSheldon: What\xe2\x80\x99s the difference?\nMissy: Goodbye Shelly.\nSheldon: My God! Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you just tell them I\xe2\x80\x99m a toll taker at the Golden Gate Bridge? Rocket scientist, how humiliating.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
