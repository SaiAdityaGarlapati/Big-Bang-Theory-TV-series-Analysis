b'Scene: The stairwell.\nLeonard: You feel like trying something new for dinner? Maybe Indian, Tex-Mex?\nSheldon: You ever wonder how humans would be different if they evolved from lizards instead of mammals?\nLeonard: Okay, let\xe2\x80\x99s talk about that.\nSheldon: As you know, lizards, cold-blooded animals, lack the ability to sense temperature. But they do move more sluggishly when it\xe2\x80\x99s cold. So, lizard weathermen would say things like, bring a sweater, it\xe2\x80\x99s slow outside. I love my mind.\nLeonard: We all do. Now, how about dinner?\nSheldon: Oh, I would assume we\xe2\x80\x99d enjoy insects or smaller lizards. We could also pull each other\xe2\x80\x99s tails off and grill them, they\xe2\x80\x99ll just grow back. Oh! My life-size cardboard Mr. Spock is here! I know he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t care for an outburst of human emotion, but, oh goodie, oh goodie, oh goodie. Commander Spock requesting permission to be unfolded.\nLeonard (seeing Penny\xe2\x80\x99s door open and the girls inside): Excuse me.\nSheldon: Permission granted, Commander.\nAmy: Which is why the more intelligent the monkey, the more faeces they fling.\nLeonard: Excuse me, Amy. Penny, do you have plans for dinner tonight?\nPenny: Why, you guys going somewhere?\nLeonard: No, I mean just you and me.\nPenny: You mean, like a date?\nLeonard: Not like a date, a date.\nAmy: Ooh!\nBernadette: Ooh!\nPenny: Um, o-okay. Sure.\nAmy: Ooh!\nBernadette: Ooh!\nSheldon: Oh, no! They sent the wrong Spock! Live long and suck it, Zachary Quinto.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom.\nBernadette: This is so exciting. If Leonard and Penny get back together, Howard and I can go on double dates with them.\nAmy: How come you never invite Sheldon and me on a double date?\nBernadette: Mm, uh\xe2\x80\xa6 How\xe2\x80\x99s it going in there, Penny?\nPenny: Just a sec. (Emerges in revealing slinky green dress) Too much?\nBernadette: Yes.\nAmy: No.\nPenny: Okay, just hang on.\nAmy: You just can\xe2\x80\x99t handle her raw sexuality, can you?\nBernadette: When did you and Leonard break up?\nPenny: Uh, about two years ago.\nBernadette: Why do you think he asked you out again?\nPenny: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\nAmy: Maybe he\xe2\x80\x99s dying. That would be so romantic.\nPenny: He\xe2\x80\x99s not dying.\nAmy: Too bad. If he were, she could just throw him in bed and ride him right up until he flatlines.\nPenny: How about this?\nBernadette: Maybe.\nAmy: Come on.\nPenny: Yeah, okay, no.\nBernadette: Do you think you\xe2\x80\x99ll sleep with him tonight?\nPenny: Absolutely not. Look, we\xe2\x80\x99re just gonna have dinner and, you know, see how it goes.\nAmy: If he were dying, would you sleep with him?\nPenny: What?\nAmy: Assuming he were dying of something that couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be sexually transmitted. You know, like a spear wound to the head.\nPenny: Okay, he is not dying.\nAmy: How do you know? Are you a doctor?\nBernadette: You can make-believe, though. Sometimes Howard and I pretend that his arrhythmia is acting up and I\xe2\x80\x99m a sexy cardiologist. And the naughty part is I\xe2\x80\x99m not in his HMO network.\nPenny: Screw it. I\xe2\x80\x99m not gonna make a big deal out of this. It\xe2\x80\x99s just dinner.\nAmy: With a dead man.\nPenny: Amy, stop it. Oh, God, I\xe2\x80\x99m so nervous.\nBernadette: Relax. You know Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s always been crazy about you. It\xe2\x80\x99s gonna be great.\nPenny: I know, but we\xe2\x80\x99ve finally gotten to a place where we can hang out without it being weird. And what if something goes wrong? Then what?\nAmy: Guess it\xe2\x80\x99ll just be Sheldon and me going on a double date with Howard and Bernadette.\nBernadette: Sure, we\xe2\x80\x99d love that. Change your clothes, we got a lot riding on this.\nScene: The apartment. The guys are playing a board game.\nSheldon: Mm. I want to build a road, but I need wood. Do either of you fellows have wood? (Raj and Howard snigger) I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand the laughter. The object of Settlers of Catan is to build roads and settlements. To do so requires wood. Now, I have sheep; I need wood. Who has wood for my sheep?\nLeonard: Okay, how do I look?\nHoward: Well, more to the point, why are you doing this?\nLeonard: What are you talking about?\nRaj: Did you forget what Penny did to you? It took you two years and defiling my sister to turn that frown upside down.\nLeonard: I didn\xe2\x80\x99t defile your sister, we had a relationship.\nRaj: I heard you call her Brown Sugar. In my book, that\xe2\x80\x99s defilement.\nSheldon: You want to know my opinion?\nLeonard: Oh, boy, do I?\nSheldon: Sarcasm?\nHoward: No.\nSheldon: All right, then. The reason you\xe2\x80\x99re fixated on a good-natured simpleton like Penny is that she\xe2\x80\x99s the exact opposite of your first romantic attachment, your brilliant yet intimidating mother.\nLeonard: Where on earth did you get that from?\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s in her book, Needy Baby, Greedy Baby.\nLeonard: That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make it true.\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s called non-fiction for a reason, Leonard.\nLeonard: See you later.\nRaj: If they ever make a movie version of that book, you know who should play Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s mother? Sandra Bullock.\nHoward: Why?\nRaj: Because she\xe2\x80\x99s great in everything.\nSheldon: Now, where were we? Oh, yes. Does anyone have any wood? Oh, come on! I just want wood. Why are you making it so hard?\nScene: A restaurant.\nLeonard: So, do they have a name for a first date with someone you used to go out with?\nPenny: Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s a good question. How about awkward?\nLeonard: Yeah, that sounds right.\nPenny: Yeah?\nLeonard: Hey, how about if we pretend we\xe2\x80\x99re actually on a first date? See how that goes.\nPenny: Okay.\nLeonard: So, Polly, tell me about yourself.\nPenny: It\xe2\x80\x99s Penny.\nLeonard: Oh, sorry, yeah. Awkward.\nPenny: Okay, uh, let\xe2\x80\x99s see. I\xe2\x80\x99m from Nebraska, and ever since I was a little girl, I dreamed of moving to L.A. and becoming a movie star. Anyway, after four years of acting lessons and waiting tables, I\xe2\x80\x99ve done a haemorrhoid commercial and a production of Anne Frank above a bowling alley. So, you know, dreams do come true. Your turn.\nLeonard: Uh, let\xe2\x80\x99s see. Uh, I am an experimental physicist at Cal-Tech, most of my research is with high-powered lasers, and, oh, I\xe2\x80\x99ve just gotten a big government grant to see if they can be used to knock out incoming ballistic missiles.\nPenny: Wow. Can they?\nLeonard: Oh, God, no. The money\xe2\x80\x99s pretty good. And I used the equipment to make my own Bat-signal.\nPenny: Bat-signal? What are you, some kind of nerd?\nLeonard: Not some kind of nerd, I am the king of the nerds.\nPenny: What does that mean?\nLeonard: Uh, it means if anyone displeases me, I don\xe2\x80\x99t help them set up their printer.\nPenny: You are so funny.\nLeonard: Good. Remember that when I take my shirt off.\nPenny: Leonard, this is nice. I\xe2\x80\x99m so glad we did this.\nLeonard: Me, too. So what do you think? Are we gonna get back together?\nPenny: Whoa. Not so fast.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, what did I say?\nPenny: Leonard, you know I will always have feelings for you.\nLeonard: Oh, God.\nPenny: What?\nLeonard: You said always. You\xe2\x80\x99ll always have feelings for me.\nPenny: So?\nLeonard: So, that sounds more like something you\xe2\x80\x99d say if you didn\xe2\x80\x99t want a relationship with someone. This isn\xe2\x80\x99t working out, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll always have feelings for you. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry I slept with your best friend, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll always have feelings for you. Here\xe2\x80\x99s the thing, Lisa, I\xe2\x80\x99m into dudes now, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll always have feelings for you.\nPenny: How would you say it?\nLeonard: I have feelings for you.\nPenny: It\xe2\x80\x99s the same thing.\nLeonard: No, it\xe2\x80\x99s not. Always made it worse.\nPenny: You\xe2\x80\x99re overthinking this.\nLeonard: No, I\xe2\x80\x99m not.\nPenny: Yes, you are. You always overthink things.\nLeonard: Ah now th-th-there you go. Always made it worse.\nPenny: See, this is where everything goes wrong, when we talk.\nLeonard: Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how you have a relationship without talking.\nPenny: Hey, I went out with this guy TJ for eight months, we never talked. To this day, I don\xe2\x80\x99t even know what TJ stands for.\nLeonard: Wait, if you guys didn\xe2\x80\x99t talk, what did you\xe2\x80\xa6 never mind, stupid question.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: And now that I have some wood, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to begin the erection of my settlement.\nRaj: He\xe2\x80\x99s got to be doing this on purpose.\nHoward (as Leonard enters): Ooh, eight thirty. You and Penny decide to go out and paint the town beige?\nLeonard: You\xe2\x80\x99re thirty years old and you live with your mother.\nRaj: I guess it didn\xe2\x80\x99t go well.\nSheldon: We don\xe2\x80\x99t know that. Not to a certainty. All we know is that Leonard is home.\nHoward (as Leonard groans loudly in his room): How about now?\nSheldon: Again, not enough evidence. For all we know, he\xe2\x80\x99s being murdered. Now, back to our game.\nRaj: You were in the middle of an erection.\nSheldon: Oh, of course. It\xe2\x80\x99s right here in my hand.\nScene: Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom. Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s phone text signal sounds.\nLeonard: What does she want from me now? (Goes to front door, where Penny is waiting) What\xe2\x80\x99s up?\nPenny: Do not overthink this. (Kisses him, then leads him to her apartment.)\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand.\nPenny: Bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup.\nLeonard: Okay, but earlier it seemed like\xe2\x80\xa6\nPenny: No talking.\nLeonard: Even during? \xe2\x80\x98Cause sometimes I have questions.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom. They are in bed.\nPenny: Well, that was fun.\nLeonard: Yeah, except for when I got the foot cramp.\nPenny: You hung in there, though.\nLeonard: Well, there was a lot at stake.\nPenny: So what do you want to do now?\nLeonard: Well, I want to go get my asthma inhaler, but it might ruin the moment. Just, just help me out here. How does a miserable date end in sex?\nPenny: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, it\xe2\x80\x99s complicated.\nLeonard: Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m a pretty smart guy, and right now my brain has dibs on the blood supply, so give it a go.\nPenny: Okay, it\xe2\x80\x99s just, at the restaurant when you said you wanted us to be together again, it got very real very fast and I panicked.\nLeonard: Why? What are you afraid of?\nPenny: Well, what if we do go out and I do something stupid and dump you again?\nLeonard: What if I dump you?\nPenny: Come on, be serious.\nLeonard: Well, how about if we don\xe2\x80\x99t think about this as a relationship? It could be more like a new version of software. Penny and Leonard 2.0. We can test it internally, shake out the bugs, and if we both feel it\xe2\x80\x99s solid, then we\xe2\x80\x99ll roll it out to the public.\nPenny: So we don\xe2\x80\x99t tell people we\xe2\x80\x99re back together?\nLeonard: Exactly. We pretend like our date went badly.\nPenny: Well, we don\xe2\x80\x99t really have to pretend.\nLeonard: And we let them think that we decided to just be friends and that everything\xe2\x80\x99s cool.\nPenny: Okay, great. Hey, I just remembered. I still got one of your inhalers.\nLeonard: I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe you kept this.\nPenny: Yeah, I was gonna throw it away, but I just couldn\xe2\x80\x99t.\nLeonard: That is so sweet. In 25 to 30 minutes I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna show you how much this means to me.\nScene: The apartment. Leonard is sneaking back in.\nSheldon: Leonard?\nLeonard: Yeah, hi, hi. How\xe2\x80\x99s it going?\nSheldon: Uh, can\xe2\x80\x99t complain. Thanks for asking. Well, what were you doing out at three o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning?\nLeonard: Well, uh, uh, what are you doing up?\nSheldon: I was using the bathroom.\nLeonard: Yeah, well, so was I.\nSheldon: Really? I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see you in there.\nLeonard: Obviously, when I saw that you were in ours, I went and used another one.\nSheldon: Where?\nLeonard: The, the gas station across the street.\nSheldon: In your pyjamas?\nLeonard: Yes.\nSheldon: Without shoes?\nLeonard: Yes.\nSheldon: On a cold winter\xe2\x80\x99s night?\nLeonard: Yes.\nSheldon: Seems unlikely. Did you bring your asthma inhaler?\nLeonard: Uh, uh, uh, yes, I did.\nSheldon: Well, then, I guess it\xe2\x80\x99s plausible. Hang on a second, mister.\nLeonard: What?\nSheldon: After you used the facilities at the gas station, did you make a purchase?\nLeonard: What?\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s customary, when using the rest room at a retail establishment, to make a small purchase. Did you?\nLeonard: No.\nSheldon: Here\xe2\x80\x99s two dollars. Go buy some beef jerky.\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t want beef jerky.\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s not about you. It\xe2\x80\x99s about a poor immigrant from Pakistan trying to make his way in America by working the graveyard shift at the Colorado Boulevard Chevron.\nLeonard: Fine.\nSheldon: Needy Baby, Greedy Baby indeed.\nScene: The Cheesecake Factory.\nSheldon: Leonard will be here in a moment. He\xe2\x80\x99s looking for a different parking space.\nHoward: Why?\nSheldon: We were next to a car with an ask me about my grandchildren bumper sticker, and I was afraid if we ran into them on the way out, I\xe2\x80\x99d be obligated to do so.\nBernadette: I\xe2\x80\x99m so disappointed it didn\xe2\x80\x99t work with him and Penny.\nAmy: Me, too. Out of deference to them, let\xe2\x80\x99s not flaunt our happy relationship.\nSheldon: You have a keen insight into the human heart, Amy Farrah Fowler.\nLeonard: We are next to a Suburu with a Gore/Lieberman bumper sticker.\nSheldon: Well, I doubt they\xe2\x80\x99d want to talk about that, so we\xe2\x80\x99re fine.\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m surprised to see you here after it went so badly with Penny.\nLeonard: Well, hey, we\xe2\x80\x99re grown-ups. We can still be friends.\nBernadette: Boy, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if I could be friends with Howie if we broke up.\nHoward: Why not?\nBernadette: I\xe2\x80\x99m a very vengeful person.\nHoward: Really?\nBernadette: With access to weaponised smallpox.\nPenny: Here you go, guys, let me get you going with some water. You need menus or you know what you want?\nHoward: Leonard knows what he wants, but it looks like he\xe2\x80\x99s not gonna get it from you.\nBernadette: Howard.\nPenny: No, that\xe2\x80\x99s okay, Bernadette. Sometimes these things just don\xe2\x80\x99t work out.\nLeonard: Yeah, it\xe2\x80\x99s all good. We-We\xe2\x80\x99ll always have feelings for each other.\nBernadette: Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s nice.\nLeonard: See, she knew what always meant.\nPenny: Wow, you\xe2\x80\x99re like a dog with a bone, aren\xe2\x80\x99t you?\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m just making a point.\nPenny: Is the point that you don\xe2\x80\x99t know when to let something go?\nSheldon: People, people, please, before you say something you both regret, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to place my order.\nPenny: Yeah, just hang on, Sheldon. You know why we can\xe2\x80\x99t be together? Because you always have to be right.\nLeonard: Oh, that is not true.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to go with Leonard on this. He is wrong more than anyone I know.\nPenny: You know what? I just realized I\xe2\x80\x99m on a break. I\xe2\x80\x99ll get someone else.\nLeonard: Well\xe2\x80\xa6\nSheldon: Leonard, promise me that when our new waitress comes over, you will not start a complicated on-again, off-again relationship with her, because I am very, very hungry.\nScene: Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom. Text signal.\nLeonard: Unbelievable. (Goes to door)\nPenny: Mind explaining to me why you were being such a jerk at the restaurant?\nLeonard: Well, I was trying to act like we weren\xe2\x80\x99t seeing each other. That was the plan, right?\nPenny: No, the plan was to tell people we decided to stay friends. That\xe2\x80\x99s a little hard to do when you\xe2\x80\x99re always being such a tool bag.\nLeonard: You know what? I don\xe2\x80\x99t have to stand here and take this crap. (Goes to Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.)\nPenny: The hell do you think you\xe2\x80\x99re going?\nLeonard: Isn\xe2\x80\x99t sex after fighting kind of what we do now?\nPenny: Yeah, kind of, yeah.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom.\nLeonard: What are we doing?\nPenny: What do you mean?\nLeonard: Every scenario I play out for you and me ends badly.\nPenny: That\xe2\x80\x99s because you overthink everything.\nSheldon\xe2\x80\x99s voice: Leonard, are you listening to me? (Leonard is in the hallway with Sheldon. It is the opening scene, and Sheldon has just found his cardboard Spock.)\nLeonard: What? Yeah.\nSheldon: This is a disaster. I distinctly ordered the Leonard Nimoy Mr. Spock cardboard standee. Why would I feel safer with Zachary Quinto at the foot of my bed?\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, he was pretty badass on Heroes.\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re right, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give him a shot.\nLeonard: Hang on. Penny, do you have plans for dinner?\nPenny: Why, you guys going somewhere?\nLeonard: No, I mean just you and me.\nAmy: Ooh!\nBernadette: Ooh!\nPenny: Uh, have you thought this through?\nLeonard: Yes, and I think we should go anyway.\nSheldon: No, can\xe2\x80\x99t do it. Sorry, Quinto, you\xe2\x80\x99re going back.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom.\nAmy: If you and Leonard get back together, Sheldon and I will finally have someone to go on double dates with.\nBernadette: What about me and Howard?\nAmy: Fine, we can double with you, too. So insecure.\nBernadette: Where are you guys going to eat?\nAmy: Penny?\n(In her imagination, Penny is transported to her wedding day.)\nMinister: Do you, Penny, take Leonard to be your lawful wedded husband?\nPenny (turning, heavily pregnant): Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s a little late for me to start saying no, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\n(Back in the bedroom)\nAmy: Penny?\nPenny: Sorry, just remembered I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to stop by the drugstore.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
