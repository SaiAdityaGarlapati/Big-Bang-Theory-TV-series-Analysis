b'Scene: Sheldon and Amy\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nAmy: If we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be staying in this apartment, would you be interested in doing a little redecorating?\nSheldon: Oh, actually, I would.\nAmy: Great, what\xe2\x80\x99d you have in mind?\nSheldon: Let\xe2\x80\x99s take every single thing from the other apartment and put it in here.\nAmy: Well, how about we start a little smaller? Like moving the furniture around.\nSheldon: You know, I have always thought that this couch would look fantastic on the curb in front of the building.\nAmy: Look, we can\xe2\x80\x99t just throw away Penny\xe2\x80\x99s stuff, but we can ask if she wants any of it back.\nSheldon: You know, I wonder how she feels about all this artwork.\nAmy: Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure she misses this one. I mean, it\xe2\x80\x99s the greatest gift I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever given anybody.\nSheldon: It truly does capture the beauty of your friendship with Penny.\nAmy: It may have appreciated in value. The artist killed himself shortly after painting that.\nSheldon: Yeah, it seems only right that she have it back.\nAmy: I can\xe2\x80\x99t wait to see the look on her face when I give it to her again.\nScene: At the apartment door.\nSheldon: Look, it\xe2\x80\x99s the same smile she has in the painting.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Yeah, there\xe2\x80\x99s hooks in the closet, I can hang it right now.\nPenny: Oh, no, no, those hooks are gone.\nSheldon: What happened to them?\nPenny: Uh, we ran out of candy on Halloween, I was just giving everything away.\nLeonard: Hey, guys, what are you, oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s here, cool.\nPenny: Amy wants me to have it.\nAmy: Well, it would be selfish of me to keep it.\nPenny: But it\xe2\x80\x99s a picture of you.\nAmy: And you.\nPenny: But you commissioned it.\nAmy: To give to you.\nPenny: But you like it so much.\nAmy: So do you.\nPenny: I seem to be losing.\nLeonard: Yes, you do.\nSheldon: You know, Leonard, the more I think about it, there are a number of mutually owned items in this apartment that you and I should go through. Uh, for example, who gets our beloved sword, Longclaw?\nPenny: Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you keep it?\nSheldon: That seems fair, we did just give you the painting.\nPenny: Yeah, I don\xe2\x80\x99t need anything around that I can stab myself with.\nSheldon: Wonderful, Longclaw is mine. And how about you keep our avocado plant?\nLeonard: Sounds right, a limited edition collectible worth hundreds of dollars and a thing that grew out of a thing we fished from the trash.\nSheldon: Although, Amy and I did just move in together, and a plant is a lovely housewarming gift.\nLeonard: Fine, take the plant.\nSheldon: Oh, we got a sword and a plant, our apartment\xe2\x80\x99s really shaping up.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s kitchen.\nBernadette: Stuart, you didn\xe2\x80\x99t have to get us a baby gift.\nStuart: Oh. Just homemade coupons for things you might need help with before the baby gets here. Going to the grocery store, driving you to the doctor, if you\xe2\x80\x99re not in a hurry I can dig you a koi pond.\nBernadette: A foot massage?\nStuart: And that\xe2\x80\x99s not me being creepy, that\xe2\x80\x99s for either of you.\nHoward: This is very nice Stuart, thank you.\nBernadette: How come this one\xe2\x80\x99s on the back of an eviction notice?\nStuart: Oh, yeah. Uh, now that you mention it, can I live here?\nBernadette: Stuart, we\xe2\x80\x99d love to help you out, but this a bad time, we\xe2\x80\x99re about to have a baby.\nStuart: Or is that why this is a great time? Think about it, when that baby comes you\xe2\x80\x99re gonna need all the help you can get.\nBernadette: Thank you, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not really sure.\nHoward: Hang on, maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s not the worst idea. I mean, he did do a good job taking care of my mother.\nStuart: That woman didn\xe2\x80\x99t get heat rash once with me on powder patrol.\nBernadette: I guess you could stay for a few days and we\xe2\x80\x99ll see how it goes.\nStuart: Thank you. And it\xe2\x80\x99s only temporary, just till I get back on my feet, or the baby goes off to college, whichever happens first.\nHoward: When would you move in?\nStuart: Well, uh, my car broke down in your driveway, so I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna say now. But I am ready to be helpful. In fact, I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna go vacuum.\nBernadette: Hmm. Actually I just did that this morning.\nStuart: Okay, then I\xe2\x80\x99ll dust.\nBernadette: I did that, too.\nStuart: Then I\xe2\x80\x99ll check the batteries in the smoke detectors.\nBernadette: Howard just did that.\nHoward: Yeah, let him do it.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Oh. Remember when we got this at Comic-Con?\nLeonard: Oh, yeah. The Mr. Spock cuckoo clock.\nMr Spock Cuckoo Clock: Live long and prosper. Live long and prosper. Live long and prosper. Live long and prosper.\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s one of a kind.\nPenny: So if it breaks there\xe2\x80\x99d be none of it?\nSheldon: Well, Leonard, you know, who should keep this? On the one hand, I love Mr. Spock more than you do. On the other hand, I care more about clocks than you do.\nLeonard: So you think you should keep it?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99ll be right across the hall. You\xe2\x80\x99ll probably be able to hear it.\nLeonard: Keep the clock, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Thank you.\nPenny: Thank you.\nAmy: Thank you?\nSheldon: Oh, now, what about our 3-D chess set?\nLeonard: Let me guess, you want it.\nSheldon: Well, no, I just didn\xe2\x80\x99t think you\xe2\x80\x99d want a physical reminder of a game you never managed to win. As a kindness, I should probably take all the games.\nLeonard: You know what, Sheldon, take it. In fact, you can have everything, I really don\xe2\x80\x99t care.\nSheldon: Are you sure? These items represent our shared times together.\nLeonard: Well, now they\xe2\x80\x99re yours.\nPenny: Leonard.\nLeonard: Well, you know what\xe2\x80\x99s gonna happen, he\xe2\x80\x99s just gonna come up with some reason why everything should be his.\nSheldon: For a man so good at predicting my moves, how come you stink at 3-D chess?\nAmy: Sheldon, you\xe2\x80\x99re, you\xe2\x80\x99re being a little selfish. Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you let Leonard keep a few things?\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s not my fault I\xe2\x80\x99m bad at sharing, I skipped kindergarten.\nLeonard: You know what? There is one thing I would like.\nSheldon: Yeah, take whatever you want.\nLeonard: I would like to keep the official flag of our apartment.\nSheldon: But you don\xe2\x80\x99t even like flags.\nLeonard: Yeah, I like this one.\nSheldon: But I designed it.\nLeonard: But you made me order it because you were too well-known in the flag community and they\xe2\x80\x99d jack up the price.\nSheldon: But you don\xe2\x80\x99t even understand its symbolism.\nLeonard: Oh, I do. The, the field of blue represents you being miserable, and the lion sticking its tongue out means I\xe2\x80\x99m happy about it.\nSheldon: Come along, Amy. I know when I\xe2\x80\x99m not wanted.\nAmy: I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you do, but all right.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s dining room.\nBernadette: Stuart, you cooked?\nHoward: How did you know it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t me?\nBernadette: There\xe2\x80\x99s only three people in this house, and you\xe2\x80\x99d still be my fifth guess.\nHoward (door bell rings): That\xe2\x80\x99s Raj.\nStuart: You guys relax, I\xe2\x80\x99ll get it. Have some bread while it\xe2\x80\x99s still warm.\nHoward: It\xe2\x80\x99s like we have a butler. If I had a Batsuit I\xe2\x80\x99d be Bruce Wayne.\nBernadette: You have a Batsuit.\nHoward: It\xe2\x80\x99s pajamas, there\xe2\x80\x99s no cape.\nStuart: Hey, Raj.\nRaj: Hey, Stuart. What are you doing here?\nStuart: Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m living here again.\nRaj: Do, uh, Howard and Bernadette know? Or is it like a possum in the walls kind of thing?\nStuart: No, I needed a place to stay and, with the baby coming, I figured they could use some extra help.\nRaj: Okay, cool.\nStuart: Anyway, come on in, dinner\xe2\x80\x99s ready.\nRaj: Oh, but I bought Chinese takeout.\nStuart: Oh, okay. Well, if Bernadette wants her ankles to swell up even more, she can have that.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: Is the Wi-Fi working for you?\nPenny: Uh, hang on. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think so, I\xe2\x80\x99m clicking on one weird trick for a flat belly, but I\xe2\x80\x99m still seeing celebrities who look like their pets.\nLeonard: Oh, I knew it, Sheldon changed the password.\nPenny: Are you sure?\nLeonard: Well, the new network name is ha ha ha, now I\xe2\x80\x99ve got you, so it\xe2\x80\x99s either Sheldon or Gargamel from The Smurfs.\nPenny: What a jerk.\nLeonard: You\xe2\x80\x99re good at revenge, how do we get him back?\nPenny: Well, my go-to move is usually sleep with the person\xe2\x80\x99s boyfriend, but I kind of feel like I\xe2\x80\x99m already doing that.\nLeonard: Sheldon, I know what you did, now change the password back.\nSheldon: Well, powder me in sugar and call me a doughnut, if it isn\xe2\x80\x99t Leonard Hofstadter.\nLeonard: Sheldon, I\xe2\x80\x99m warning you, I can play this game, too.\nSheldon: If it\xe2\x80\x99s like your 3-D chess game, then you\xe2\x80\x99re out of your length, width and depth. Amy, get the Neosporin, somebody just got burned.\nLeonard: All right, I tried.\nSheldon: All right, I tried. That should be the title of your autobiography. Ooh, a second-degree burn.\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99ve got the Neosporin. Who got hurt?\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing you\xe2\x80\x99re cute.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s dining room.\nRaj: So, I was reading how it\xe2\x80\x99s a good idea for new parents to take an infant CPR class.\nBernadette: Yeah, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been meaning to do that.\nStuart: Oh, I know a CPR instructor who\xe2\x80\x99ll come to the house.\nHoward: That\xe2\x80\x99d be great.\nStuart: I\xe2\x80\x99ll give him a call. We met when I was sleeping on the beach and he thought I was dead.\nBernadette: Thank you again for cooking. It\xe2\x80\x99s getting tough for me to be on my feet all day.\nStuart: You just kick back and relax, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got it all under control.\nRaj: Although it was already under control.\nStuart: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, you mumbled something?\nRaj: It\xe2\x80\x99s just that they\xe2\x80\x99ve had plenty of help.\nStuart: Well, you know what they say, it takes a village.\nRaj: Well, they already had a village.\nStuart: I noticed the village couldn\xe2\x80\x99t find time to put the crib together.\nRaj: Yeah, well, maybe the village was too busy checking out the local Montessori school for the new arrival.\nStuart: You mean the one with the empty beer bottles in the sandbox? We\xe2\x80\x99ll pass, thank you.\nBernadette: Do something, Batman.\nScene: The laundry room.\nLeonard: Hey.\nSheldon: What do you think you\xe2\x80\x99re doing?\nLeonard: Separating my delicates.\nSheldon: This is the level you\xe2\x80\x99re stooping to.\nLeonard: No. This is the level I am stooping to. I believe that is flag to crotch four, checkmate. Easy-peasy, ooh, so breezy.\nScene: Howard and Bernadett\xe2\x80\x99s house.\nStuart: Hey, what\xe2\x80\x99s up?\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99m here to put the crib together.\nStuart: Ooh, sorry, I already did it.\nRaj: Well I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if you realize this, but I bought that crib.\nStuart: Oh, yeah, I read about that on WhoGivesACrap.com\nRaj: Why are you being like this?\nStuart: Because I love Howard and Bernadette and if I want to keep mooching off them, I need to be helpful.\nRaj: Hey, this pregnancy had an emotionally-needy third wheel way before you came along.\nStuart: Why can\xe2\x80\x99t there be four wheels?\nRaj: Is this what you do when I\xe2\x80\x99m not here, make really good points?\nStuart: Look, just come in and help me build a baby swing.\nRaj: Thank you.\nStuart: If you\xe2\x80\x99re hungry you can eat your take-out, nobody touched it.\nScene: The stairwell.\nPenny: I think I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna go for a run, you want to come?\nLeonard: No, last time that old lady in the park kept screaming, watch out, he\xe2\x80\x99s right behind you. Hello?\nStrange old man: Hey, how you doing?\nLeonard: Uh, can I help you?\nStrange old man: I don\xe2\x80\x99t think so, but you\xe2\x80\x99re sweet for asking.\nPenny: What, what are you doing in our apartment?\nStrange old man: Oh, I rented a room from your neighbour, the tall guy dressed like a little boy.\nLeonard: Unbelievable. Okay, uh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what he told you, but you can\xe2\x80\x99t stay here.\nSheldon: So, there are fresh linens on the bed and, oh, well, now, I see you\xe2\x80\x99ve met Theodore. Theodore, these are your new room mates, Leonard and Penny. They\xe2\x80\x99re very honest, but I would not leave cash lying around.\nLeonard: Sheldon, what do you think you\xe2\x80\x99re doing?\nSheldon: My room is paid up until the end of the month, so I can do with it whatever I please, which includes renting it out for a dollar a night.\nTheodore: It\xe2\x80\x99s like the \xe2\x80\x9940s again.\nSheldon: Anyway, I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave you be. I have to, oh, oh, he\xe2\x80\x99s expecting a newspaper in the morning. Apparently, they still make them.\nPenny: All right, Sheldon, this is over the line.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s true, but had I done something under the line, there wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be a man in your kitchen who can\xe2\x80\x99t produce a single form of ID.\nTheodore: Oh, oh, I have a receipt from a blood bank. I\xe2\x80\x99m O-negative.\nSheldon: And now you know as much about him as I do.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s living room.\nRaj: Oh, hey, Bernadette, the swing comes with two different mobiles. The giraffes are pretty cute, what do you think?\nBernadette: Great, go with the giraffes.\nStuart: Although the high contrast of zebra stripes might provide better stimulus for a developing baby.\nBernadette: Yeah, you\xe2\x80\x99re probably right, go with the zebras.\nStuart: Good choice, boss.\nRaj: At least my nose is naturally brown.\nBernadette: Hey, could you please go to the market for me?\nHoward: Get Stuart or Raj to do it.\nBernadette: Howie, they\xe2\x80\x99ve been doing everything for you.\nHoward: Mm, I know. It\xe2\x80\x99s really making me lose respect for both of them.\nBernadette: Please just go to the store.\nHoward: Fine. Who wants to drive me to the store?\nRaj (off): Me\nStuart (off): I\xe2\x80\x99ll do it.\nBernadette: Take Raj. Stuart is supposed to paint my toenails.\nScene: The apartment.\nPenny: What do you think? Should we go to a hotel?\nLeonard: And just leave him here alone?\nPenny: Okay, I\xe2\x80\x99ll go to a hotel. Text me in the morning if you\xe2\x80\x99re still alive.\nLeonard: Uh, Theodore, how long are you planning to stay exactly?\nTheodore: Oh, thanks to the coins I found in your couch, a day longer than I thought.\nLeonard: This is ridiculous.\nTheodore: I like the painting. Is that your mom?\nLeonard: Sheldon, get out here.\nSheldon: Will you keep it down? What kind of vengeful bed and breakfast do you think I\xe2\x80\x99m running?\nLeonard: We lived together 13 years. How can you be so awful to me?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m being awful? You\xe2\x80\x99re the one who went out of your way to hurt me.\nLeonard: Because you were being selfish.\nSheldon: Dividing our belongings is difficult.\nLeonard: Why? I said I didn\xe2\x80\x99t care.\nTheodore: Excuse me. It\xe2\x80\x99s none of my business, but it sounds like a lot of this anger is coming from love.\nLeonard: Yeah, thanks, but nobody asked you.\nTheodore: Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m just gonna keep on talking. Seems like, with Sheldon moving out, you\xe2\x80\x99re in a new phase of your lives and it\xe2\x80\x99s easier to fight than to face the feelings that you have for one another.\nAmy: I think he might be right. Also, who is that?\nSheldon: I have to admit, leaving you to move in with Amy has been harder than I thought it would be.\nLeonard: Well, for me, too. It\xe2\x80\x99s not the same with you gone.\nTheodore: If you\xe2\x80\x99re looking for a new guy to live with.\nLeonard: No.\nPenny: We\xe2\x80\x99re good, thank you.\nAmy: So, no one\xe2\x80\x99s gonna tell me? Okay.\nSheldon: Leonard, I would like us to stop fighting about our possessions.\nLeonard: Well, I\xe2\x80\x99d like that, too.\nSheldon: In fact, I want you to keep the apartment flag, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not just saying that because it touched your genitals.\nLeonard: You promise?\nSheldon: I do. And to show you that there are no hard feelings, I am willing to rub my genitals on it as well.\nTheodore: Well if we\xe2\x80\x99re rubbing genitals on things, that\xe2\x80\x99s where I shine.\nScene: The apartment.\nPenny: Little lower to the left. A little more.\nLeonard: Good?\nPenny: No, still hideous.\nLeonard: Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure at some point, we won\xe2\x80\x99t even notice it\xe2\x80\x99s there.\nPenny: Yeah, you\xe2\x80\x99d think that, but after a while it starts showing up in your dreams.\nTheodore: I think it brings the room together.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s living room.\nHoward: Hey, tomorrow who wants to paint the nursery?\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99ll do it.\nStuart: Why do you get to do it? I\xe2\x80\x99m the artist.\nRaj: Just because you\xe2\x80\x99re starving doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make you an artist.\nStuart: Just because I look sickly doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean I\xe2\x80\x99m starving.\nBernadette (off): Howard!\nHoward: Guys, you heard her, go see what she wants.\nBernadette: I think I\xe2\x80\x99m in labour.\nHoward: Oh, oh, okay, okay, uh, uh, uh, I can do this. We have a plan. Somebody please tell me the plan.\nStuart: I\xe2\x80\x99ll get the hospital bag.\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99ll pull the van up.\nStuart: Meet you outside in 2 minutes.\nRaj: Team Baby, go.\nHoward: I love you.\nBernadette: I love you, too.\nStuart: Are we hugging or having a baby? Let\xe2\x80\x99s go.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
