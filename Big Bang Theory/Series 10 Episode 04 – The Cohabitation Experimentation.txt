b'Scene: The foyer.\nAmy: And there was water everywhere, it was such a mess.\nLeonard: That stinks. How long are you out of the apartment?\nAmy: About five weeks.\nPenny: Ugh, did you lose anything valuable?\nAmy: Well, the pipe was over my closet, so all my clothes are gone.\nPenny: Oh, so nothing. Great. Do they know why the pipe burst?\nAmy: They didn\xe2\x80\x99t say.\nLeonard: Buildings that have a combination of copper and galvanized steel are susceptible to pinholes and corrosion caused by the mobility of ions in the water. Can\xe2\x80\x99t have your head shoved in a toilet as much as I did and not pick up a few things about plumbing.\nPenny: Well, if you need a place to crash, you can stay with us.\nAmy: Really?\nPenny: Of course. You can stay in Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s room, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll stay at my place.\nAmy: You\xe2\x80\x99re sure that\xe2\x80\x99s not an inconvenience?\nPenny: No, not at all.\nLeonard: And we live with Sheldon, so the word inconvenience has really lost all meaning.\nAmy: So, technically, I\xe2\x80\x99d be moving in with my boyfriend?\nPenny: I guess so. And I\xe2\x80\x99d finally get to live alone with my husband.\nAmy: Oh, my, this is a big step.\nLeonard: Mm-hmm. For two of us, it\xe2\x80\x99s in the right direction.\nSheldon: Why are you all smiling like crazy people?\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Cohabitation with my girlfriend? That\xe2\x80\x99s a great deal to process.\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s only for five weeks.\nPenny: Yeah, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll be right across the hall.\nAmy: What do you think?\nSheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. What if living together kills the romance?\nPenny: Okay, you guys had sex one whole time. Nothing can put out a fire like that.\nSheldon: Yeah, but what happens when we each get a peek behind the curtain? I mean, she\xe2\x80\x99s never even seen me unshaven.\nLeonard: You just shaved yesterday. You\xe2\x80\x99re good for three months.\nAmy: Sheldon, I understand your apprehension, but let me appeal to the scientist in you. Given the five-week end date, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it the perfect opportunity to consider this an experiment and collect data on our compatibility?\nSheldon: Don\xe2\x80\x99t try luring me in with sexy talk.\nLeonard: Okay. Star Trek, the original series, the Enterprise was on a five-year mission to explore new worlds. Think of this as your personal five-week mission to do the same.\nSheldon: If you want to lure me in with sexy talk, that\xe2\x80\x99s how you do it.\nPenny: Don\xe2\x80\x99t be proud of that.\nAmy: So, is that a yes?\nSheldon: Not yet. How will I learn if I\xe2\x80\x99m comfortable living with Amy or just comfortable because I\xe2\x80\x99m in my own apartment? Now, if this experiment is going to be valid, I suggest a neutral environment.\nPenny: Well, where would you go?\nSheldon: Well, ideally, an enclosed, self-sustaining biodome in New Mexico, where we would eat crops fertilized with our own waste.\nLeonard: And you were worried about the romance. 00:03:18,914\nPenny: Wait. Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you guys stay across the hall, and we will live here?\nSheldon: Interesting. If my official residence were across the hall, I wonder if I\xe2\x80\x99d need to knock every time I came over here.\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99s a good question. Maybe just don\xe2\x80\x99t come over.\nSheldon: Historically, I don\xe2\x80\x99t do well with change.\nPenny: Okay, it won\xe2\x80\x99t be that bad. We wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t even sit in your spot while you\xe2\x80\x99re gone.\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re darn right, you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t. No matter where I am, this will always be my spot. Like an embassy in a foreign country, this seat is the sovereign soil of my bottom.\nLeonard: Just nod and smile. He\xe2\x80\x99s almost gone.\nAmy: Sheldon, what do you think?\nSheldon: Very well. I\xe2\x80\x99m on board.\nAmy: Seriously?\nSheldon: Yes. I accept this five-week mission to share a living space with my girlfriend.\nAmy: Oh. This is so exciting.\nSheldon: Well, now, don\xe2\x80\x99t be surprised if, like Star Trek, it\xe2\x80\x99s cancelled in three.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s kitchen.\nRaj: I have to say, I am happy with your OBGYN.\nHoward: Cool. \xe2\x80\x98Cause she says you\xe2\x80\x99re doing a great job as weird friend who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have to be at every appointment.\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99m the son of a gynaecologist. I could be helpful.\nBernadette: It would help if you stopped telling me I have a textbook cervix.\nRaj: The polite response is, thank you for noticing.\nBernadette: Let me see the sonogram again. Oh, yeah, that\xe2\x80\x99s a good-looking baby for a little grey blob.\nHoward: Yeah, we could name him Blobert.\nBernadette: What if it\xe2\x80\x99s a girl?\nHoward: Bloberta. Or Blobbi with an I.\nBernadette: Are we being silly not finding out the sex?\nHoward: Yeah, I was just thinking the same thing.\nRaj: If you want, you can find out right now.\nHoward: Mm.\nBernadette: Hmm. The doctor\xe2\x80\x99s gone for the day, so it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter.\nRaj: Well, somebody else knows because they saw it in the folder.\nBernadette: You looked in our folder?!\nRaj: It was an accident. The doctor left the folder out on her desk. It\xe2\x80\x99s not my fault I opened it and looked.\nHoward: So you know the sex of our baby, and we don\xe2\x80\x99t?\nRaj: Flip a coin. You got a fifty-fifty shot.\nHoward: It\xe2\x80\x99s unbelievable.\nBernadette: God, Raj.\nRaj: What? This is not a problem, okay? If you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to know, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have to tell you.\nBernadette: We don\xe2\x80\x99t want you to know.\nRaj: Okay, well, that\xe2\x80\x99s a problem.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nPenny: You know, I\xe2\x80\x99m very proud of you for trying to live with Amy.\nSheldon: Oh. Thank you.\nPenny: Mm.\nSheldon: Of course, the ideal way to conduct this experiment would be with four pairs of identical Sheldons and Amys. One pair that was neither dating nor living together. One pair that was dating but not living together. One pair that was living together but not dating. And then, of course, one pair that was living together and dating. Although, with that many Sheldons, it\xe2\x80\x99d be such a party, we\xe2\x80\x99d never get anything done.\nPenny: That was a cute story. So, um, what did you want to ask me?\nSheldon: Well, you\xe2\x80\x99ve lived with your significant other for some time. I would like this experiment to go well. Are there any insights you can share?\nPenny: Mm. Well, the biggie is, if she has an insane roommate, kick him out as soon as possible.\nSheldon: You know, Leonard and I were very happy before you came along.\nScene: The apartment.\nAmy: You\xe2\x80\x99ve been roommates with Sheldon forever. Do you have any advice?\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to think of an answer that won\xe2\x80\x99t stop you from doing this.\nCutting between Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment and Leonard and Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nPenny: I know it sounds like a clich\xc3\xa9, but compromise is key.\nLeonard: Never leave a belt on the floor. At night, they look like snakes.\nPenny: Do little things, like bring her a cup of coffee in bed.\nLeonard: Keep M&M\xe2\x80\x99S in your pocket in case you have to wait in a long line.\nPenny: You\xe2\x80\x99re gonna be seeing each other a lot, so respect each other\xe2\x80\x99s personal space.\nLeonard: He startles easily, so, please, no flash photography.\nScene: Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom.\nSheldon: How many pairs of underwear did you pack for the move?\nAmy: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t count.\nSheldon: You truly are the Goofus to my Gallant.\nAmy: That\xe2\x80\x99s me. Listen, you and I are gonna be sharing a bed. You know, this is uncharted territory for both of us. How are you feeling about that?\nSheldon: Oh, excited, concerned, a little scared. All the same emotions I feel in line at Space Mountain.\nAmy: Well, if you\xe2\x80\x99re nervous about the sleeping arrangements, maybe we should talk about it.\nSheldon: Okay. Talk.\nAmy: Well, I imagine one of your concerns might be coital expectations.\nSheldon: Wow, no foreplay or anything, just right to it.\nAmy: Look, I know this experiment is a big step outside of your comfort zone. So why don\xe2\x80\x99t we take being physical off the table and maybe later on, once we\xe2\x80\x99re more settled in, we can revisit it.\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re really okay with that?\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99ve never lived with someone, either. This is a lot for me, too.\nSheldon: This is such a relief. Honestly, if it didn\xe2\x80\x99t get you all worked up, I\xe2\x80\x99d kiss you right now.\nAmy: Good call. Seeing your Teen Titans underwear really got my motor running.\nSheldon: I know. They probably shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t sell those to children.\nScene: The hallway.\nPenny: Well, here\xe2\x80\x99s your key.\nAmy: Thank you.\nSheldon: Enjoy having the place to yourselves.\nLeonard: You enjoy your mission to boldly go where no man has gone before.\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s Penny\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom. Plenty of men have gone before.\nPenny: Now, now, there\xe2\x80\x99s no need to make this emotional.\nAmy: Shall we?\nSheldon: I guess this is it.\nLeonard: You guys have fun.\nSheldon: You, too. Oh, don\xe2\x80\x99t forget. Tuesday the air filters need to be changed.\nPenny: Yeah, you wrote it on my hand.\nSheldon: Oh. Oh, and every other day, check the water level on the avocado pit.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m on it. 15 years from now, we\xe2\x80\x99ll make guacamole together.\nSheldon: Leonard, please, let me go.\nAmy: Come on, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Oh. Bye.\nLeonard: Good night.\nPenny: Good night.\nAmy: Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s it. For the next five weeks, we are officially living together.\nSheldon: I guess the experiment begins.\nPenny (off, screaming): Wa-how, we did it.\nLeonard (off, also screaming): Yeah.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom.\nSheldon: Which side of the bed would you prefer?\nAmy: Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter to me. Your choice.\nSheldon: No, no, we\xe2\x80\x99re living together now, everything\xe2\x80\x99s equal. You know? I know that I have a tendency to be controlling, so I would rather you choose.\nAmy: Well, Sheldon, I really appreciate that, but these things mean more to you than they do to me, so whatever you want.\nSheldon: Well, clearly, it\xe2\x80\x99s not whatever I want, because what I want is for you to make this decision, and you refuse to do that.\nAmy: Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not refusing. I\xe2\x80\x99m just trying to be considerate.\nSheldon: Like when you let me get those shoes with the wheels on the bottom, and then watched me roll right into traffic?\nAmy: Sheldon, will you please just pick a side?\nSheldon: Fine. Okay. Now, on this side, I am closer to the exit in case of emergency.\nAmy: Great. That\xe2\x80\x99s your side.\nSheldon: No, but I\xe2\x80\x99m also closer to the entrance in case of attack.\nAmy: Okay, I\xe2\x80\x99ll take that side.\nSheldon: Ah, then again, what are the odds of someone attacking me?\nAmy: Rising rapidly.\nSheldon: Now, this side offers me proximity to the bathroom, but I am closer to the window where perverts can watch me sleep.\nAmy: Okay. What if we do this?\nSheldon: I suppose that works.\nAmy: Great.\nSheldon: Although now I\xe2\x80\x99m kind of worried someone\xe2\x80\x99s hiding behind those drapes.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom.\nBernadette: This is ridiculous. The doctor knows what the baby is, the ultrasound tech knows, Raj knows, his Grey\xe2\x80\x99s Anatomy online fan group probably knows. Is it weird we don\xe2\x80\x99t?\nHoward: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Maybe the surprise will make it more fun. Like magic tricks. Remember how disappointed you were when I explained the never-ending hanky?\nBernadette: I was disappointed to see the man I was engaged to pulling rainbow scarves out of his fly.\nHoward: But how delightful was it when I pulled out a bouquet at the end of those scarves? It\xe2\x80\x99ll be the same thing when the doctor pulls a beautiful surprise out of you.\nBernadette: Everyone said I could do better.\nHoward: But you didn\xe2\x80\x99t listen, and presto change-o, my baby\xe2\x80\x99s inside you. Ta-da.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom.\nAmy (off): Ugh. What is that? (Entering) Why did you switch sides?\nSheldon: Be grateful I\xe2\x80\x99m still in the room.\nAmy: Comfy?\nSheldon: Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m just happy I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what this memory foam remembers.\nAmy: Sheldon? I know we took coitus off the table, but I was wondering how you feel about other forms of intimacy, such as snuggling.\nSheldon: Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s funny you should ask, because I was wondering how you\xe2\x80\x99d feel about separating the two of us with a pillow wall.\nAmy: Sheldon, I\xe2\x80\x99ve made more than enough accommodations for you. We\xe2\x80\x99re both grown adults, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been far more intimate than this. If you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to snuggle, fine, but we\xe2\x80\x99re not building a pillow wall.\nSheldon: Okay, well, I am sorry. I\xe2\x80\x99m just worried that my sensitivity to temperature could make this a rough night. And no offence, but your bottom radiates enough heat, I\xe2\x80\x99m surprised there aren\xe2\x80\x99t iguanas lying on it.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99s it. It\xe2\x80\x99s Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s bedtime, he is in for the night.\nPenny: Wow. I cannot believe we are alone in our own apartment.\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s weird. This must be how parents feel when their kid goes off to college. Unless they feel sad, then it\xe2\x80\x99s different.\nPenny: So, what do you want to do?\nLeonard: I know exactly what we are gonna do.\nPenny: Really? You\xe2\x80\x99re a genius, and that\xe2\x80\x99s the first thing you come up with?\nLeonard: Hey, Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s not here, so we are going to put on music and dance in our underwear.\nPenny: Ugh. Can we just have sex?\nLeonard: Oh, don\xe2\x80\x99t worry. Once you see my sweet moves, sex is inevitable.\nPenny: Inevitable, you say?\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99ll just let my hips do the talkin\xe2\x80\x99.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom.\nHoward: Screw it. I\xe2\x80\x99m calling and finding out.\nBernadette: Good. Call him. Wait, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure I want to know.\nHoward: But you just said you wanted to know.\nBernadette: Well, now I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if I want to know!\nRaj: Hello?\nHoward: Call you back.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom.\nSheldon: No, Dr. Feynman. If I solve it for you, you\xe2\x80\x99ll never learn.\nScene: The apartment.\nPenny: Wow, where did you learn these moves?\nLeonard: The world may have forgotten about Dance Dance Revolution, but not this smooth criminal.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom.\nHoward: Okay, you\xe2\x80\x99re positive you want to know?\nBernadette: Yes.\nHoward: Okay. Here we go. It\xe2\x80\x99s ringing.\nRaj: Hello?\nBernadette: Wait.\nHoward: Wrong number.\nScene: The apartment.\nPenny: I told you not to do the worm.\nLeonard: You were right.\nScene: Raj\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom. Phone rings.\nRaj: Hello.\nBernadette (off): I changed my mind, hang up, hang up.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom.\nAmy: Oh, oh, oh.\nSheldon: What are you doing down there?\nAmy: Hang on.\nSheldon: Who are you calling? Aaargh!\nScene: The apartment.\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99m so sore. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I slept two minutes last night.\nPenny: Yeah, get it, girl.\nAmy: It\xe2\x80\x99s not what you think.\nLeonard: I feel like I pulled something. Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you tell me to stop?\nPenny: Even more not what you think.\nAmy: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if I can make it through five weeks living with him.\nLeonard: If you ever need a break, the owner of the train store will let you leave him there while you get a coffee.\nPenny: Yeah.\nSheldon: Good morning. See? I didn\xe2\x80\x99t knock, but it\xe2\x80\x99s fine. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t knock, but it\xe2\x80\x99s fine. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t knock, but it\xe2\x80\x99s fine. So, how is everyone?\nAmy: Miserable and exhausted.\nSheldon: Really? I slept great.\nAmy: Well, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t, and it\xe2\x80\x99s your fault.\nSheldon: How? You had the whole floor to yourself.\nAmy: Sheldon, maybe living together is a bad idea.\nSheldon: Well, but what kind of scientists would we be, drawing a conclusion after only 12 hours of data?\nAmy: The kind who almost put a pillow over your face last night.\nSheldon: Wow. I anticipated we\xe2\x80\x99d have problems, but I never thought your scientific rigour would be one of them.\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, are you questioning my integrity as a scientist?\nSheldon: If the lab room disposable shoe cover fits.\nPenny: Was that a science diss?\nLeonard: Yeah.\nPenny: Was it a good one?\nLeonard: Eh.\nPenny: Oh.\nAmy: What would a theoretical physicist understand about an experiment anyway? I mean, you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t know a confounding variable if two of them hit you in the face at the same time. And you don\xe2\x80\x99t even get that joke, \xe2\x80\x99cause you don\xe2\x80\x99t even work with confounding variables.\nSheldon: How dare you?\nAmy: Oh, you heard me. Your experimental bona fides are laughable.\nSheldon: Whoa, whoa! Now you\xe2\x80\x99re making fun of my bona fides?\nAmy: Can\xe2\x80\x99t make fun of something that\xe2\x80\x99s a null set.\nPenny: I feel like I should say damn.\nLeonard: Do it.\nPenny: Damn.\nSheldon: Well, if you are so protective of the scientific method, perhaps we should use the next five weeks to finish what we started.\nAmy: Well, for science, maybe I will.\nSheldon: For science, maybe you should.\nAmy: Fine.\nSheldon: Fine.\nAmy: Good.\nSheldon: Great.\nAmy: Do you want to go to our place and make out?\nSheldon: Does Stephen Hawking roll through the quad?\nPenny: The new neighbours are weird.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
