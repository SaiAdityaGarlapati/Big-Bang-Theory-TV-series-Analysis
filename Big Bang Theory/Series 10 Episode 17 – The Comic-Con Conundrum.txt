b'Following a \xe2\x80\x9cpreviously on\xe2\x80\x9d sequence:\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Uh-huh. Interesting. Okay.\nRaj: How bad is it?\nSheldon: Let me put it this way, do you own a barrel and suspenders?\nRaj: Are you serious?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m not wearing this visor to play women\xe2\x80\x99s golf.\nPenny: Hi.\nLeonard: Hey.\nPenny: Oh, let me guess. You guys are drafting your fantasy accounting firms.\nLeonard: We\xe2\x80\x99re helping Raj figure out his finances.\nPenny: Well, he has a job. How bad can it be?\nSheldon: Well, his rent and car lease are exceedingly high. You couple that with his penchant for dining out and shopping.\nPenny: Wait, wait, not shopping for clothes, right? Because look.\nSheldon: He also has a remarkable amount of credit card debt.\nHoward: I thought your dad paid your cards.\nRaj: I have a card for emergencies that I pay for myself.\nSheldon: What emergency happened at the L.A. Zoo?\nRaj: That\xe2\x80\x99s a penguin I sponsor. They\xe2\x80\x99re losing their homes to global warming, and my car gets, like, seven miles a gallon, so I felt bad.\nLeonard: What is Pink Cheeks?\nRaj: It\xe2\x80\x99s intimate waxing. Quit looking at that.\nLeonard: Maybe you should find someone to help you get your finances under control.\nRaj: Like a business manager?\nSheldon: No, absolutely not. You can\xe2\x80\x99t afford to hire someone who\xe2\x80\x99ll forbid you from spending your money on foolish expenses. That is a foolish expense, and I forbid it.\nHoward: What if there\xe2\x80\x99s someone who just likes controlling other people and stealing joy from their lives?\nSheldon: He sounds like a sociopath.\nLeonard: We don\xe2\x80\x99t know, his mother never had him tested.\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re talking about me. Very funny. Although I would enjoy drawing up a budget and forcing Raj to adhere to it without an ounce of compassion.\nPenny: Wait, wait, who\xe2\x80\x99s gonna break it to the penguin?\nRaj: Okay, Sheldon. Yeah, I\xe2\x80\x99m putting you in charge of my finances. I will not spend another penny that you don\xe2\x80\x99t authorize.\nSheldon: Very well. Hey, Comic-Con tickets go on sale this Friday. You can\xe2\x80\x99t buy one.\nHoward: Oh, better luck next time, Pink Cheeks.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: Sheldon and Amy\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nAmy: You\xe2\x80\x99re actually going to Comic-Con?\nPenny: Well, Leonard wants me to do more stuff like that with him, so I thought maybe this year I\xe2\x80\x99d tag along.\nAmy: Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s sweet. I bet you\xe2\x80\x99ll have fun.\nPenny: So, do you want to come?\nAmy: No, thanks. I already live in a place all the nerds come to.\nPenny: Please? I went to your boring thing last month.\nAmy: My aunt\xe2\x80\x99s funeral?\nPenny: Come on, even you checked your e-mail during the eulogy.\nAmy: Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going, but I do think it\xe2\x80\x99s nice you want to.\nPenny: It\xe2\x80\x99s not that I want to go, I just think it\xe2\x80\x99ll make Leonard happy. And if I have to watch him squeeze into an Ewok costume, so be it.\nAmy: Look at you, going to Comic-Con, talking about Ewoks. I really have become the cool one around here.\nScene: The comic book store.\nHoward: You actually think Penny will have fun at Comic-Con?\nLeonard: No. Which will make me miserable, which is usually Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s job.\nSheldon: She\xe2\x80\x99s gonna hate waiting in line for the panels.\nHoward: And hate all the crowds at the panels.\nSheldon: She\xe2\x80\x99s gonna hate the panels.\nLeonard: She\xe2\x80\x99s gonna hate how often we say the word panels.\nHoward: Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you just tell her not to come?\nLeonard: Well, she\xe2\x80\x99s so excited, I can\xe2\x80\x99t do that to her.\nHoward: What if you make it sound so bad she won\xe2\x80\x99t want to go?\nLeonard: That I would do to her.\nRaj: I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe Penny\xe2\x80\x99s gonna get to go, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not.\nSheldon: You can always watch the panels online. Oh, boy, we do say that a lot.\nStuart: Panels. Just wanted to be included.\nRaj; Come on, Sheldon, it\xe2\x80\x99s Comic-Con. Just let me have the money for this, and I won\xe2\x80\x99t ask for anything else.\nSheldon: You put me in charge of your finances. If you wanted someone weak and spineless you could walk all over, you should have asked Leonard.\nLeonard: See? Miserable.\nRaj: Okay, you\xe2\x80\x99re right, I got myself into this, but I\xe2\x80\x99ve never missed a Comic-Con with you guys.\nSheldon: Your father may have spoiled you, but I won\xe2\x80\x99t. If you want a ticket to Comic-Con, I suggest you figure out a way to earn the money yourself.\nHoward: Yeah, you\xe2\x80\x99re a grown man who\xe2\x80\x99s highly educated. You could charge people money to punch you.\nRaj: Go ahead, make jokes. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why you think you\xe2\x80\x99re going to Comic-Con, you just had a baby.\nHoward: So?\nRaj: Well, so? So you think Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s just gonna let you jet down to San Diego for five days and leave her alone?\nLeonard: Hang, hang on. So I have to bring Penny, you can\xe2\x80\x99t afford it, Howard\xe2\x80\x99s gonna get in trouble, and this guy gets to have a great time.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna go as Dumbledore.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s kitchen.\nHoward: Mm-mm, how\xe2\x80\x99s my favourite girl?\nBernadette: Okay.\nHoward: What you doing?\nBernadette: Making lasagna.\nHoward: Oh, she\xe2\x80\x99s sexy, she can cook. I\xe2\x80\x99m such a lucky guy.\nBernadette: You want something stupid, or you did something stupid?\nHoward: No. I just walked in here, saw how beautiful you are and had to tell you.\nBernadette: Oh, dear God, you\xe2\x80\x99re cheating on me with Raj.\nHoward: Ha ha ha, never gets old. Okay, there is something I want, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not a big deal.\nBernadette: What is it?\nHoward: Well, Comic-Con tickets go on sale this Friday, and I was hoping I could go with the guys. But before you say anything, I\xe2\x80\x99ll make up for being gone by doing everything around here, I mean everything. I\xe2\x80\x99m even gonna answer for you. Yes, Howard, you can go.\nBernadette: It\xe2\x80\x99s so hard to say no to you.\nHoward: Thank you.\nBernadette: So I\xe2\x80\x99ll say maybe.\nHoward: What? Why?\nBernadette: You said tickets don\xe2\x80\x99t go on sale till Friday, right?\nHoward: Yeah.\nBernadette: You said you were gonna do all this stuff for me, right?\nHoward: Yeah.\nBernadette: See where I\xe2\x80\x99m going with this?\nHoward: Yeah.\nBernadette: If you don\xe2\x80\x99t know how to make lasagna, Google does.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: Okay, so this is the main Comic-Con floor. It\xe2\x80\x99s where all the vendors and exhibits are.\nPenny: Wow, that is a lot of people jammed in there.\nLeonard: I know. Sometimes Howard wears a striped shirt so we can play Where\xe2\x80\x99s Wolowitz? Okay, now, This is us camping out in line for the Avengers panel.\nPenny: Oh, you really sleep on the sidewalk, huh?\nLeonard: Yeah. It can get chilly, but Raj figured out that if you pee in a bottle and put it in your sleeping bag, it helps keep you warm. Here\xe2\x80\x99s the hotel room we all share.\nPenny: Well, you and I would get our own room, right?\nLeonard: Every hotel is booked. But, yeah, see this space here between Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s feet and my head? That\xe2\x80\x99s where you go.\nPenny: Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s no different than when Sheldon used to climb in bed with us during a thunderstorm.\nLeonard: Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry, we won\xe2\x80\x99t be doing much sleeping anyway. It\xe2\x80\x99s like an all-night party. There\xe2\x80\x99s trivia contests and Dungeons & Dragons. As we like to say, it\xe2\x80\x99s off the chain mail.\nScene: The comic book store.\nLeonard: I even said off the chain mail, and she still wants to go.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s probably my fault. She may have heard about my cool Dumbledore costume.\nStuart: Okay, I can give you 20 bucks for the whole box.\nRaj: But you charged me hundreds for this stuff.\nStuart: I know. And I did it with a straight face.\nRaj: But I need to earn enough money so I can go to Comic-Con.\nStuart: Well, all right. I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you 25 bucks. That\xe2\x80\x99s my best offer.\nRaj: I have no choice.\nStuart: You know, if you want to make extra money, I could throw some work your way.\nRaj: Really? I\xe2\x80\x99ll do anything.\nStuart: Great, you\xe2\x80\x99re hired. First thing you can do is put price tags on these. Start the little ones at fifty.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s car.\nPenny: You know, it\xe2\x80\x99s no big deal. I can put up with anything for three days.\nAmy: Comic-Con\xe2\x80\x99s five days.\nPenny: Are you kidding me?\nAmy: Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you just tell him you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to go?\nPenny: I can\xe2\x80\x99t, it\xe2\x80\x99ll break his heart. You know, he\xe2\x80\x99s always making an effort to do things with me he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t enjoy, like going outside.\nAmy: He is an indoor cat.\nPenny: You know, maybe it won\xe2\x80\x99t be that bad. Leonard says it\xe2\x80\x99s really mainstream now. Comic books aren\xe2\x80\x99t just for sad nerds any more. I mean, it is still a key part of their demographic.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s house. Raj rings the doorbell.\nBernadette (off): Howie, can you get that?\nHoward (off): Kind of busy.\nBernadette (off): Busy like I\xe2\x80\x99ll be with the baby if you go to San Diego?\nHoward: Hey.\nRaj: What\xe2\x80\x99s with the gloves?\nHoward: They complete my ensemble. What do you want?\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99m looking to make extra money and was wondering if you had any chores I could do.\nHoward: Hang on. Bernie, can I outsource my chores to an Indian guy?\nBernadette: No.\nHoward: I tried.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: Hey, I was thinking, if you want to do a couples costume, we could paint ourselves green and be Hulk and She-Hulk. Or we could paint ourselves blue and go as Nightcrawler and Mystique.\nPenny: Is there any scenario where we\xe2\x80\x99re not in full body paint?\nLeonard: Yeah, if you want us to look like losers.\nPenny: Hey, um, are you sure the guys are okay with me coming?\nLeonard: Yeah, of course, why?\nPenny: This is just something you usually do together, and if I\xe2\x80\x99m screwing it up, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have to go.\nLeonard: Oh, why? Do you not want to go?\nPenny: Why? Do you not want me to go?\nLeonard: No, I want you to go.\nPenny: Okay, good, \xe2\x80\x99cause that\xe2\x80\x99s what I want, too.\nScene: Sheldon and Amy\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nLeonard: Now we\xe2\x80\x99re going as Hulk and She-Hulk. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to take my shirt off at Comic-Con.\nSheldon: If I may speak for Comic-Con, we don\xe2\x80\x99t want that either.\nLeonard: Is that nice?\nSheldon: No, but it\xe2\x80\x99s honest, and it sounds like you could use a little more honesty in your relationship.\nLeonard: Uh, it\xe2\x80\x99s more complicated than that.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m always honest with Amy. The other day she said she was self-conscious about the beauty mark on her shoulder, and I said, you know, you can call that a beauty mark all you want. When there\xe2\x80\x99s hair growing out of it, that\xe2\x80\x99s a mole.\nLeonard: Do you think she\xe2\x80\x99s as honest with you?\nSheldon: I should hope so. When she called me an insensitive jerk, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to think she meant it.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s kitchen.\nHoward: There\xe2\x80\x99s got to be other ways you can make a quick buck.\nRaj: Yeah, you\xe2\x80\x99d think. Ooh, maybe I could sell my blood and sperm.\nBernadette: I really should wear a bell around my neck so you guys can hear me coming.\nRaj: Here, let me help you.\nBernadette: Thank you.\nRaj: Oh, Double Stuffed Oreos, I remember when I could afford you.\nBernadette: There she goes.\nRaj: Stay, I\xe2\x80\x99ll get her.\nBernadette: I appreciate it.\nRaj: That\xe2\x80\x99s fine. She and I can cry together.\nBernadette: He\xe2\x80\x99s such a sweetie.\nHoward: I know, I wish there was some way we could help him.\nBernadette: If he could find a girl with a job, all his problems would be over.\nHoward: Yeah, that\xe2\x80\x99s working out great for me.\nScene: Sheldon and Amy\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nAmy: Penny says they\xe2\x80\x99re ready to go.\nSheldon: Very well. Prepare for a long night of deceit.\nAmy: Sheldon, women can wear make up, it\xe2\x80\x99s not lying.\nSheldon: I was talking about Leonard. And if make up is so truthful, why is it called concealer?\nAmy: Wait, wait, wait, what\xe2\x80\x99s Leonard lying about?\nSheldon: He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t really want Penny to go to Comic-Con. He\xe2\x80\x99s just doing it to make her happy.\nAmy: Really? Because she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t actually want to go. She\xe2\x80\x99s just doing it to make him happy.\nSheldon: So they\xe2\x80\x99re both trying to make each other happy, and the end result is they make each other sad? That\xe2\x80\x99s hilarious. I can\xe2\x80\x99t wait to tell them.\nAmy: No, you\xe2\x80\x99re not gonna tell them anything. You\xe2\x80\x99re gonna stay out of it.\nSheldon: Why?\nAmy: Because it\xe2\x80\x99s between them.\nSheldon: Well, if you haven\xe2\x80\x99t noticed, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been between them for the last ten years.\nPenny: Hey.\nAmy: Hi.\nSheldon: Hello.\nPenny: Hey, babe, you want to drive?\nLeonard: Sure, or you can.\nPenny: No, it\xe2\x80\x99s fine, I know you don\xe2\x80\x99t like the way I drive.\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a problem with your driving.\nSheldon: Are you listening to this? They deceive each other about everything.\nAmy: Shh.\nPenny: Just so you know, that guy in the parking lot hit me.\nLeonard: He wasn\xe2\x80\x99t in a car, but okay.\nPenny: Just say you want to drive.\nLeonard: I honestly don\xe2\x80\x99t.\nPenny: Amy, do us a favour, please drive.\nAmy: Sure, happy to.\nLeonard: If you want to drive, just drive. I don\xe2\x80\x99t see why this has to be so complicated.\nPenny: It\xe2\x80\x99s not complicated. Amy\xe2\x80\x99s driving, that\xe2\x80\x99s it.\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99s not it because you\xe2\x80\x99re clearly upset.\nPenny: You\xe2\x80\x99re the one who seems upset.\nLeonard: Why would I be upset?\nAmy: Because you don\xe2\x80\x99t want her to go to Comic-Con.\nSheldon: This is an interesting way to stay out of it.\nPenny: Wait, you don\xe2\x80\x99t want me to go?\nLeonard: Well, I just don\xe2\x80\x99t think you\xe2\x80\x99re gonna have a good time.\nSheldon: Yeah, well, get this, neither does Penny, that\xe2\x80\x99s why she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to go. You set \xe2\x80\x99em up, I knock \xe2\x80\x99em down, good job.\nLeonard: Why would you say you wanted to go if you didn\xe2\x80\x99t?\nPenny: I just thought it would make you happy.\nLeonard: O-o-o-okay, hold on, so if you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to go and I don\xe2\x80\x99t need to bring you, is everything good?\nPenny: Hold on, I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to decide if I\xe2\x80\x99m mad at you. No, I\xe2\x80\x99m happy I don\xe2\x80\x99t have to go.\nLeonard: All right, problem solved.\nPenny: Okay.\nSheldon: Not entirely, the fight over who\xe2\x80\x99s going to drive is still\xe2\x80\xa6\nAmy: Oh, my God, stop talking.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s house.\nAmy: The place looks great. Did you guys get a maid?\nBernadette: Kinda.\nHoward: Dinner\xe2\x80\x99s almost ready. If you like meatloaf, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you\xe2\x80\x99ll like its cousin, bowl of meat.\nPenny: Hey, if you\xe2\x80\x99re still looking to make money, I will pay you to burn that jacket.\nRaj: Thank you, but it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t look like I\xe2\x80\x99m going to Comic-Con this year.\nSheldon: Well, with as much debt as you have, probably not next year either.\nBernadette: Howie?\nHoward: Sure. This is for you.\nRaj: What\xe2\x80\x99s this?\nBernadette: It\xe2\x80\x99s back pay for all the babysitting and taking care of Halley you\xe2\x80\x99ve done.\nHoward: There\xe2\x80\x99s more than enough in there to cover Comic-Con.\nStuart: Um, I also take care of Halley.\nBernadette: And you live here for free.\nStuart: I do, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, thank you, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\nRaj: This is so generous of you, I, um, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to say.\nLeonard: Now you can come with us.\nPenny: Yeah, there\xe2\x80\x99s room in the bed by Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s feet.\nRaj: As much as I appreciate this, I can\xe2\x80\x99t accept it, okay? Halley\xe2\x80\x99s my goddaughter, I don\xe2\x80\x99t take care of her for money.\nStuart: I would.\nBernadette: Keep it. Consider it a gift.\nSheldon: Hold on. Is it back pay or is it a gift?\nBernadette: What\xe2\x80\x99s the difference?\nSheldon: When the IRS questions us in separate rooms, we need to have our stories straight.\nRaj: It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter. I\xe2\x80\x99m not keeping this. I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to pay my own way and be responsible. Taking handouts won\xe2\x80\x99t help that.\nAmy: So you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to Comic-Con?\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99ve been plenty of times. If I miss one, it\xe2\x80\x99s fine. I\xe2\x80\x99m a big boy.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m a big boy, and if I missed one, I\xe2\x80\x99d throw a big-boy tantrum.\nLeonard: You know what? I\xe2\x80\x99ve gone 12 times. Maybe I\xe2\x80\x99ll sit out this year, too.\nPenny: Really?\nLeonard: Yeah. Maybe you and I can do something fun that weekend.\nPenny: Ooh, how about white-water rafting?\nLeonard: Oh, how about we compromise and go on the Small World ride at Disneyland?\nHoward: You know what, I\xe2\x80\x99m not gonna go either. I\xe2\x80\x99m a father now. I\xe2\x80\x99d rather spend time with my family.\nBernadette: You just don\xe2\x80\x99t want to go alone with Sheldon.\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna go check on dinner.\nAmy: Sounds like everyone\xe2\x80\x99s staying home. What do you say?\nSheldon: Nuts to that, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to Comic-Con.\nAmy: By yourself?\nSheldon: Not necessarily. I have four months to find some new friends.\nStuart: I\xe2\x80\x99ll go with you.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s very kind of you, Stuart. Check back in with me in July.\nScene: Sheldon and Amy\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nSheldon: There\xe2\x80\x99s my pretty girlfriend.\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99m not going with you to Comic-Con.\nSheldon: What? Can\xe2\x80\x99t a man just be happy to see his woman and pat her on her second most erogenous ball-and-socket joint?\nAmy: He can, but it\xe2\x80\x99s still not changing my mind.\nSheldon: Well, maybe what\xe2\x80\x99s in my pants will change your mind. It\xe2\x80\x99s a list of this year\xe2\x80\x99s panelists. It\xe2\x80\x99s long, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\nAdvertisements'
