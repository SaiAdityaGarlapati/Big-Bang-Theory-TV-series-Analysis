b'Scene: The apartment.\nBernadette: I like your suit.\nPenny: Oh, thanks. Got a couple new outfits for work.\nHoward: How does it feel knowing your fianc\xc3\xa9e\xe2\x80\x99s job is to go out and flirt with doctors, looking like that, while you sit here, you know, looking like this?\nLeonard: She doesn\xe2\x80\x99t flirt with doctors.\nPenny: Yeah. It\xe2\x80\x99s all very professional.\nAmy: You know when you bend over, I can see down your shirt?\nPenny: Okay, good.\nBernadette: Speaking of new careers, how are things going with dark matter, Sheldon?\nSheldon: Oh, yeah, I\xe2\x80\x99d have to say it\xe2\x80\x99s the most exiting time in the history of the field.\nBernadette: Oh. What\xe2\x80\x99s going on?\nSheldon: I started doing it.\nRaj: You know, the government funded the biggest experiment yet to detect dark matter.\nLeonard: Yeah, I\xe2\x80\x99ve read about that, they\xe2\x80\x99re sending research teams down into abandoned salt mines.\nRaj: You know, Sheldon, if we apply to be one of those teams, we could be on the ground floor of something big, not just for theoretical physics but for astrophysics as well.\nPenny: Wait, hang on, you guys are gonna work in a mine?\nSheldon: Why not?\nPenny: You had a panic attack when we went through the car wash.\nSheldon: Perhaps the emotion you\xe2\x80\x99re referring to was shock at you having something cleaned.\nLeonard: I think what Penny meant is, the thought of you two in a mine is kind of funny, it\xe2\x80\x99s like a cat riding a Roomba.\nHoward:If they get scared, they\xe2\x80\x99ll have those hats with the lights on them, \xe2\x80\x99cause down there it\xe2\x80\x99s night-night all the time.\nBernadette: Maybe they could ride around in one of those mine carts that go ee-oo-ee-oo-ee-oo.\nLeonard: Yeah, it\xe2\x80\x99ll help them get away when they see a g-g-ghost.\nSheldon:Are they making fun of us?\nRaj: Yup.\nSheldon: I miss the old days when I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t tell.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nLeonard: So, one of my favourite video games of all time is called Shadow of the Colossus, and it was only for PlayStation 2, but then they came out with a new version for PS3 with better graphics. I finally got the chance to play it, and for some reason, it just wasn\xe2\x80\x99t as good as the first one. Or something about yoga.\nPenny: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, I was thinking about work.\nLeonard: Well, I was just saying that there was this video game\xe2\x80\xa6\nPenny: Yeah, that\xe2\x80\x99s when I started thinking about work. Uh, listen, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got some good news.\nLeonard: Hmm.\nPenny: This is for you.\nLeonard: Huh. What is this?\nPenny: Well, you know how they gave me the company car? Didn\xe2\x80\x99t make sense to have two, so I sold the other one.\nLeonard: The one I gave you?\nPenny: Yeah. And there\xe2\x80\x99s your money back, and now we\xe2\x80\x99re even. How great is that?\nLeonard: Uh, yeah.\nPenny: What?\nLeonard: Nothing.\nPenny: Oh, come on, Leonard, I know the car was a thoughtful gesture and I really appreciate it, but it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make sense to have both.\nLeonard: You\xe2\x80\x99re right.\nPenny: What should I have done? Taken a picture of us in the car and put it in a pink frame with puffy paint around it that says best fianc\xc3\xa9 ever?\nLeonard: Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t sound that bad.\nPenny: Well, good, because that\xe2\x80\x99s what I did.\nLeonard: Aw, oh, thank you. That is so sweet.\nPenny: Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s not that sweet, I paid for the frame with your money and then got a massage.\nLeonard: You know what, you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to give me this. You keep it.\nPenny: Why?\nLeonard: The car was a gift, it was something you needed. I was happy to help you out.\nPenny: And I really appreciate it, but now I don\xe2\x80\x99t need it, so here you go.\nLeonard: Well, this is silly, so you don\xe2\x80\x99t need the car, but you could use it to buy yourself something else, like a new purse to put all this money in.\nPenny: Sweetie, I can buy my own stuff. I have a good job now.\nLeonard: I know, and I\xe2\x80\x99m proud of you, but that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean I can\xe2\x80\x99t do something nice. Like this.\nPenny: Okay, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want this to turn into a fight.\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t, either.\nPenny: Great. Thank you. Can you pass the salt, please?\nLeonard: Sure. In my mind, that broke the tension with comedy and led to sex.\nScene: Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s office.\nRaj: Hey, Sheldon, you busy?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m always busy. This mind is capable of advanced multitasking. You know, currently, I\xe2\x80\x99m attempting to solve the Penrose conjecture, I\xe2\x80\x99m composing my Nobel acceptance speech for when I\xe2\x80\x99ve solved the Penrose conjecture, and I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering how mermaids have babies.\nRaj: Don\xe2\x80\x99t they lay eggs on a rock?\nSheldon: Now I\xe2\x80\x99ve got room for another thing. What do you want?\nRaj: So, I did a little research on what the conditions are like in the mines, and the guys might be right, sounds pretty rough down there. For starters, it\xe2\x80\x99s very humid, and about a hundred degrees.\nSheldon: Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m from Texas and you\xe2\x80\x99re from India, we\xe2\x80\x99re no strangers to the fragrant armpit. Next.\nRaj: It\xe2\x80\x99s also a live mine, so there\xe2\x80\x99ll be dynamite explosions going off in the distance.\nSheldon: Yeah, I have a lactose intolerant roommate with a taste for ice cream. Next.\nRaj: Oh, you have to be down there for 12 hours at a time.\nSheldon: Yeah? We have to be somewhere.\nRaj: Well, there\xe2\x80\x99s no toilets, we\xe2\x80\x99ll have to do our business in a bucket.\nSheldon: So it\xe2\x80\x99s settled, we\xe2\x80\x99re not doing it.\nRaj: Look, I get it, but before we pass up on an incredible opportunity, I was thinking about when Howard was training to go to space, they put him in a simulated environment.\nSheldon: Interesting. You\xe2\x80\x99re suggesting that we recreate the conditions of the mine to see if we can handle it.\nRaj: Exactly.\nSheldon: Very well.\nRaj: So where should we do it?\nSheldon: Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll just Google hot, dark and moist, see what comes up.\nRaj: Uh, Sheldon\xe2\x80\xa6\nSheldon: Oh, there, well, look, there\xe2\x80\x99s all kinds of videos.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nLeonard: Hey, you got a sec?\nPenny: Hi. Sure.\nLeonard: I was hoping we could talk about the money again.\nPenny: Oh, sweetie, just forget about it.\nLeonard: No, no, no, no, hear me out. I know things got a little weird last night.\nPenny: Well, leaving an envelope full of cash on my dresser after sex would count as weird.\nLeonard: Well, I think I came up with a pretty good solution.\nPenny: Mm.\nLeonard: Why don\xe2\x80\x99t we just put the money in a joint account? It\xe2\x80\x99ll be our first money together. We can use it for the wedding, the honeymoon, whatever.\nPenny: You know what, that\xe2\x80\x99s great. I love that.\nLeonard: Yeah, of course you do, I\xe2\x80\x99m not just a genius in bed. You sure are, baby.\nPenny: You two want to be alone?\nLeonard: I want you to know I get why you don\xe2\x80\x99t want the money, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got this new job, you\xe2\x80\x99re excited about being financially independent, and I am nothing but proud of you.\nPenny: Oh, thank you so much. It feels so good to hear you say that. And I want you to know that I get this job kind of changes the balance in our relationship, and I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to be sensitive to that.\nLeonard: What?\nPenny: Well, I just think that maybe you\xe2\x80\x99re a little hung up on the money because I\xe2\x80\x99m less reliant on you now, and that\xe2\x80\x99s a little scary.\nLeonard: Hmm. Maybe. Or maybe I tried to do something nice and maybe you had a problem with it because of your control issues.\nPenny: Control issues?\nLeonard: Maybe.\nPenny: Or, maybe now that I\xe2\x80\x99m no longer an out-of-work actress who can\xe2\x80\x99t pay for her own dinner, that makes you a little insecure.\nLeonard: Well, I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe you\xe2\x80\x99d say that. You know how insecure I am about my insecurities.\nPenny: You know what? I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. It\xe2\x80\x99s stupid to fight over money.\nLeonard: Yeah, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, too. We\xe2\x80\x99re about to share the rest of our lives together. It\xe2\x80\x99s our money, who cares who has it?\nPenny: Ugh, You\xe2\x80\x99re right, who cares? Mm. Get that money out of my back pocket or I will break your fingers.\nScene: The university basement.\nRaj: Huh. All this time I never knew there were steam tunnels down here.\nAmy: Most universities have them. When I was an undergrad, I spent three days in one pledging a sorority.\nRaj: Did you get in?\nAmy: No. They forgot I was there. But it really opened up my pores.\nSheldon: Well, according to my research, the steam tunnels below this access point should be the closest analog to the mines.\nRaj: This is gonna be so much more accurate than the steam room at the gym.\nSheldon: Plus, there\xe2\x80\x99s almost no chance we\xe2\x80\x99ll see any of our coworkers half naked.\nRaj: Or totally naked. I love Howard, but the dude needs a little shame.\nSheldon: All right, Amy, this walkie-talkie is yours. If we run into any problems, I\xe2\x80\x99ll contact you. And if anything bad happens, what\xe2\x80\x99s the rule?\nAmy: Save you first; come back for Raj only if there\xe2\x80\x99s time.\nRaj: We\xe2\x80\x99re going to be fine.\nAmy: Sheldon, I\xe2\x80\x99m really impressed you\xe2\x80\x99re willing to try this.\nSheldon: Well, admittedly, this brushes up against my well-known aversions to heat, small places, going below floor-level, dampness, hatches, ladders, darkness, echoes, and eliminating in Home Depot buckets. That last one is quite new, but I have a feeling that\xe2\x80\x99s gonna rocket to the top of the list.\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99m sweating already.\nSheldon: Yeah, as the person beneath you, allow me to say, I know.\nRaj: How hot is it?\nSheldon: Uh, let\xe2\x80\x99s see. 704? No, wait, it\xe2\x80\x99s on clock. Uh, the real answer isn\xe2\x80\x99t much better. 102 degrees.\nRaj: Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s what we wanted. This is as hot as the mines will be.\nSheldon: True. Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s Mine Simulation Log, entry one. Koothrappali\xe2\x80\x99s restating of the obvious is already getting on my nerves.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nLeonard: Thanks again for having us.\nHoward: Oh, of course. What did you guys want to talk about?\nPenny: Well, you know, now that we\xe2\x80\x99re engaged, we had some questions about how you handle money as a couple.\nBernadette: I told you they weren\xe2\x80\x99t gonna ask us to swing with them.\nHoward: I didn\xe2\x80\x99t think they were going to. I just wanted to have a way to say no without hurting Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s feelings.\nLeonard: Well, nailed it.\nHoward: So what did you want to know?\nPenny: Well, do you guys ever fight over money?\nBernadette: Sure, sometimes. I mean, it can be a little awkward since I make so much more money than Howie.\nHoward: You didn\xe2\x80\x99t have to say so much more.\nBernadette: Well, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t have to, but for the sake of accuracy I felt that I should.\nHoward: I brought a lot of significant assets into the relationship, too.\nBernadette: Like what? Your incomplete set of Star Trek collector plates?\nHoward: For your information, I just bought the last one I needed on eBay.\nBernadette: Without asking me?\nHoward: There were only three minutes left in the auction and it was a mint condition Scotty from a smoke-free home.\nBernadette: How much, Howie?\nHoward: Not a lot.\nBernadette: How much?\nHoward: Let\xe2\x80\x99s not talk about this in front of our friends.\nBernadette: Was it more or less than falconry school?\nHoward: For the tenth time, that was a Groupon.\nLeonard: Like I would swing with him.\nScene: The steam tunnel.\nRaj: How you feeling?\nSheldon: Good. Little claustrophobic.\nRaj: Let\xe2\x80\x99s set up the equipment. It\xe2\x80\x99ll help take your mind off of it.\nSheldon: Miners often sang mining songs to keep their spirits up.\nRaj: Do you know any mining songs?\nSheldon: Just the hits. (Singing) Where it\xe2\x80\x99s dark as a dungeon, and it\xe2\x80\x99s damp as the dew.\nRajj: That\xe2\x80\x99s pretty.\nSheldon: Where the dangers are double, and the pleasures are few. Where the rain never falls and the sun never shines, yes, it\xe2\x80\x99s dark as a dungeon way down in the mine.\nRaj: It\xe2\x80\x99s a little more bleak than I thought.\nSheldon: Well, I pray when I\xe2\x80\x99m dead and the ages shall roll, that my body will blacken and turn into coal.\nRaj: Getting kind of grim.\nSheldon: Then I\xe2\x80\x99ll look from the door of my heavenly home, and pity the miner that mines my poor bones.\nRaj: Okay. How \xe2\x80\x99bout a little Miley Cyrus next?\nSheldon: Who\xe2\x80\x99s he?\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nHoward: Talk about wasted money. What about the late fees on our credit card because somebody didn\xe2\x80\x99t pay the bill on time?\nBernadette: Well, maybe I would have paid it if I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t also doing everything else around here.\nHoward: Oh, you\xe2\x80\x99re saying I don\xe2\x80\x99t do anything around here. Look at my chore chart.\nLeonard: She made him a chore chart.\nPenny: I see it.\nHoward: Do the dishes. There\xe2\x80\x99s a star right there.\nBernadette: That was a pity star. Putting water in the roasting pan and leaving it in the sink is not doing the dishes.\nHoward: That pan had to soak and you know it.\nBernadette: Well, don\xe2\x80\x99t come crying to me when you don\xe2\x80\x99t get your allowance.\nHoward: It\xe2\x80\x99s not an allowance. It\xe2\x80\x99s a stipend, and we said we weren\xe2\x80\x99t gonna call it an allowance in front of my friends.\nLeonard: I usually don\xe2\x80\x99t like lemon bars, but these, these are really good.\nScene: The steam tunnel.\nRaj: So, as Hannah Montana, Miley was a world-famous pop star. But then she would take off her wig and go to school like a normal girl. Which, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have to tell you, at that age, is its own headache.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s preposterous. How would she go unrecognized just by wearing a wig?\nRaj: But you\xe2\x80\x99re okay with Superman concealing his identity with a pair of glasses?\nSheldon: He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t just put on a pair of glasses. He combs back his curlicue and affects a mild-mannered personality.\nAmy (shouting): You guys doing okay down there?\nSheldon: I told you to use the walkie-talkie!\nAmy (on walkie-talkie): You guys doing okay down there?\nSheldon: Please keep this channel clear for emergencies. Thank you.\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99m going to the vending machine. Do you want anything?\nSheldon: This is a simulation. We have to survive on the supplies we brought.\nAmy: Okay, just checking.\nRaj: We should have asked her to get some Funyuns.\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re not going to have Funyuns when we\xe2\x80\x99re a mile below the surface of the Earth.\nRaj: What if we brought them down with us?\nSheldon: We\xe2\x80\x99ll take some Funyuns.\nAmy: Anything else?\nSheldon: Some York Peppermint Patties, a couple of Dr. Peppers, and run to Best Buy and see if they have a portable DVD player and season one of a show called Hannah Montana.\nRajj: Have her get season two. Season one, it was still finding itself.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nBernadette: Sorry you guys had to see that.\nPenny: Oh, don\xe2\x80\x99t apologize.\nLeonard: Yeah. It just makes it a lot harder to pretend it never happened.\nBernadette: Money\xe2\x80\x99s a sensitive subject for Howie because of the difference in our income.\nPenny: It really bothers him?\nBernadette: Well, sure. There\xe2\x80\x99s still a lot of pressure on guys to be providers. So even though he\xe2\x80\x99s happy for me, it\xe2\x80\x99s just a little tough on him.\nPenny: Uh-oh.\nLeonard: What?\nPenny: Well, if I do well in sales, I could end up making a lot more money than you.\nLeonard: Not a problem. I grew up with a mother who emasculated my father financially and in every other aspect of his life, so really, it\xe2\x80\x99s what I think love looks like.\nBernadette: I\xe2\x80\x99ll be right back. I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna go check on him.\nPenny: Maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing we came here. It\xe2\x80\x99s like a lesson in what not to do.\nLeonard: Yeah I don\xe2\x80\x99t want something dumb like money to come between us.\nPenny: It won\xe2\x80\x99t. Let\xe2\x80\x99s just promise to figure this kind of stuff out before we get married.\nHoward (off): Why are you being so bossy?\nBernadette (off): Why are you being a baby?\nHoward (off): I\xe2\x80\x99m not a baby. I\xe2\x80\x99m a grown man, and I made the bed. Now where\xe2\x80\x99s my star?\nLeonard: Should we go?\nPenny: Hang on. I want to see if he gets the star.\nScene: The steam tunnel.\nRaj: Oh, this heat is brutal.\nSheldon: As someone from the tropical subcontinent of India, you should know that fanning yourself in a humid environment only raises your body temperature.\nRajj: Huh. That does explain why the servants used to look so hot while they were fanning me. Let\xe2\x80\x99s get our minds off how uncomfortable we are. We could take some more simulated instrument readings.\nSheldon: My major focus at the moment is keeping my claustrophobia at bay.\nRaj: How\xe2\x80\x99s that going?\nSheldon: You tell me. I feel like I can\xe2\x80\x99t breathe, and I am tempted to crack you open and suck the air right out of your lungs.\nRaj: Sheldon, if this is too much, we can stop.\nSheldon: We\xe2\x80\x99re not stopping.\nRaj: You don\xe2\x80\x99t have to bite my head off.\nSheldon: I apologize. I just, I\xe2\x80\x99m plagued by an internal struggle.\nRaj: If you would just use the bucket, you\xe2\x80\x99d be so much more comfortable.\nSheldon: My struggle is emotional.\nRaj: Oh. Is it Amy?\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s dark matter. When I entered the field of string theory, I was a prodigy. I rose to a position of respect, and I assumed my career would continue on that upward trajectory. Now here I am in my 30s, I\xe2\x80\x99m back at square one. And, frankly, it\xe2\x80\x99s frightening.\nRaj: Sheldon, you know what I think of when I\xe2\x80\x99m scared? Voyager.\nSheldon: Voyager the space probe or Voyager the Star Trek TV show?\nRaj: The space probe.\nSheldon: Good. Because I am too hot and tired to go on about how much I hate Voyager the TV show.\nRaj: By the time I was born, Voyager 1\xe2\x80\x99s mission was supposed to be over. It had seen Jupiter and Saturn and all their moons, but it kept going. When I left India for America, I was never more scared in my life. I had no idea what lay ahead. Whenever I feel that way, I think about how Voyager is still out there somewhere beyond our solar system, going further than anyone ever thought it could. Don\xe2\x80\x99t leave. You can do this.\nAmy: Sheldon, is everything okay?\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s too late for Koothrappali. Let\xe2\x80\x99s go.\nAmy: 11 minutes. That\xe2\x80\x99s longer than I thought.\nRaj (off): They\xe2\x80\x99re in my shirt. They\xe2\x80\x99re in my shirt. They\xe2\x80\x99re in my shirt.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom.\nPenny: Okay, this is definitely the most fun thing we can do with the money.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99ve never done it on a big old pile of cash before. Me neither, Leonard. It\xe2\x80\x99s my first time, too.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom.\nBernadette: I\xe2\x80\x99m so sorry I made you feel bad about the money stuff.\nHoward: It\xe2\x80\x99s okay.\nBernadette: No, it\xe2\x80\x99s not okay. I want us to be partners, equals. Adults in a mature relationship.\nHoward: I want that, too.\nBernadette: Now, let\xe2\x80\x99s talk about your birthday party.\nHoward: Ooh, laser tag, laser tag.\nBernadette: Oh.\nScene: The apartment.\nAmy: Do you really need me to transcribe this?\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re not doing it for me. You\xe2\x80\x99re doing it for future generations who will benefit from my struggle. (Voice on recorder) Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s Mine Simulation Log, entry four. My Kit Kat has melted. All is lost.\nRaj: You call yourself a friend? I was trying to help you, and at the first sign of trouble you ran away, leaving me to fend off a family of rats. You\xe2\x80\x99re a completely selfish human being and a, and a physical and a moral coward.\nSheldon: His statements of the obvious continue to annoy.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
