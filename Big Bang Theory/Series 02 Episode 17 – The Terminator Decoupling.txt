b'Scene: The Apartment\nHoward: Okay, Raj, hand me the number six torque screwdriver.\nSheldon: Stop. We can\xe2\x80\x99t do this, it\xe2\x80\x99s not right.\nRaj: Sheldon, you have two choices. Either you let him put a bigger hard drive in the TiVo, or you delete stuff before we go out of town.\nSheldon: But once you open the box, you\xe2\x80\x99ve voided the warranty. The warranty is a sacred covenant we\xe2\x80\x99ve entered into with the manufacturer. He offers to stand by his equipment, and we in return agree not to violate the integrity of the internal hardware. This little orange sticker is all that stands between us and anarchy.\nLeonard: Okay, then we won\xe2\x80\x99t touch the hard drive. We\xe2\x80\x99ll just erase the first season of Battlestar.\nSheldon (ripping off sticker): There. We\xe2\x80\x99re outlaws.\nPenny (entering with a pink suitcase): Here you go, Leonard. Is this going to be big enough?\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s perfect.\nHoward: For taking daffodils to your unicorn.\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s just for my notebooks. Thanks, Penny.\nPenny: Oh, I love San Francisco. I wish I was going with you.\nSheldon: I understand your envy. This is a can\xe2\x80\x99t-miss symposium. There are going to be discussions on bioorganic cellular computer devices, the advancements in multi-threaded task completion, plus a roundtable on the nonequilibrium Green\xe2\x80\x99s function approach to the photoionization process in atoms.\nPenny: When I go, I usually just get hammered and ride the cable cars.\nLeonard: This conference is kind of a big thing. The keynote address is being delivered by George Smoot.\nPenny: Oh, my God, the George Smoot?\nLeonard: You\xe2\x80\x99ve heard of him?\nPenny: Of course I haven\xe2\x80\x99t.\nSheldon: George Smoot is a Nobel Prize-winning physicist, one of the great minds of our time. His work in black body form and anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background radiation cemented our understanding of the origin of the universe.\nPenny: It\xe2\x80\x99s kind of a funny name, though, Smoot.\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s like talking to a chimp.\nPenny: Okay, now that I\xe2\x80\x99ve been completely insulted, have a good flight.\nLeonard: Yeah, I wish.\nSheldon: We\xe2\x80\x99re not flying, we\xe2\x80\x99re taking the train.\nPenny: Oh, cool.\nHoward: Yeah, cool. Seven times as long as flying, and costs almost twice as much.\nPenny: Well, then why are you doing it?\nLeonard: Well, we had a vote. Three of us voted for airplane, Sheldon voted for train, so we\xe2\x80\x99re taking the train.\nSheldon: Don\xe2\x80\x99t say it like that, Leonard, say it like: we\xe2\x80\x99re taking the train!\nCredits sequence.\n  Scene: Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom.\nLeonard: Hey, we\xe2\x80\x99re all going over to the Apple store to make fun of the guys at the Genius Bar. You want to come?\nSheldon: Oh, I always enjoy that, but I\xe2\x80\x99m a little busy.\nLeonard: What are you doing?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m simplifying the task of packing for our trip. See, by attaching RFID tags to my clothing, it will enable my laptop to read and identify the items with this wand. I will then cross-reference them against destination, anticipated activity spectrum, weather conditions, duration of trip, et cetera.\nLeonard: Well, that does sound much simpler. How long is this going to take?\nSheldon: Assuming I can keep up this pace, three hours, 11 minutes, and plus however long it takes to conclude this fairly pointless conversation.\nLeonard: Wow. Teasing the guys at the Apple store seems a little redundant now.\nSheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t follow.\nLeonard: I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t expect you to. I\xe2\x80\x99ll see you later.\nSheldon: Socks, one pair, cotton, argyle, blue. Socks, one pair, cotton, argyle, blue.\nScene: On the train.\nSheldon: What on earth are you doing?\nRaj: Whatever it is, I\xe2\x80\x99m guessing we\xe2\x80\x99re doing it wrong.\nSheldon: Gentlemen, this is the Coast Starlight, one of the great American trains operating on one of the classic American routes. On this side, you\xe2\x80\x99ll see panoramic ocean vistas inaccessible to any other form of transportation, while on your side, you\xe2\x80\x99ll be treated to 350 miles of CostCos, Jiffy Lubes, and cinderblock homes with above-ground pools.\nHoward: Come on, Raj.\nRaj: What\xe2\x80\x99s wrong with Jiffy Lubes?\nSheldon: No.\nLeonard: Why not?\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s over the wheelbase. Are you completely unfamiliar with the suspension characteristics of a pre-1980 Pullman-built Superliner Deluxe passenger coach?\nLeonard: Sheldon, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been on this train 90 seconds, and you\xe2\x80\x99ve already said a thousand words. Just tell us where to sit and shut up.\nSheldon: Here. I\xe2\x80\x99m hoping once you reap the endorphic rewards of the steady clickety-clack of steel wheels on polished rails, your sour disposition will abate.\nLeonard: Yeah, maybe. Meanwhile back in the 21st century, people are raising their tray tables and putting their seat-backs in an upright position \xe2\x80\x99cause it\xe2\x80\x99s time to land in San Francisco.\nRaj: It\xe2\x80\x99s not so bad, really. At least these trains have modern plumbing. In India, you squat over a hole in the train and expose your naked buttocks to the chilly air of Rajasthan.\nSheldon: He is referring, of course, to third class on Indian Railways\xe2\x80\x99 magnificent Ranakpur Express and its twelve hundred kilometer journey from Maharashtra to the Bikaner Junction.\nLeonard: Oh, look, now he\xe2\x80\x99s boring on an international scale.\nRaj: Holy crap! Look!\nLeonard: Is that who I think it is?\nHoward: It can\xe2\x80\x99t be. What would Summer Glau be doing riding the train?\nLeonard: Maybe John Connor\xe2\x80\x99s aboard and she\xe2\x80\x99s protecting him from an evil Terminator.\nSheldon: Unlikely. That\xe2\x80\x99s a television show, Leonard.\nLeonard: Thank you.\nSheldon: Of course, if SkyNet actually did exist in the future, a perfect way to infiltrate and destroy mankind would be to send Terminators back posing as actors who have played Terminators in popular films and television series, lulling us into a false sense of security, i.e., that\xe2\x80\x99s Summer Glau from The Sarah Connor Chronicles. No, Summer, don\xe2\x80\x99t kill me! I\xe2\x80\x99m pro-robot! Ahh!\nLeonard: At least he\xe2\x80\x99s off the train crap.\nSheldon: Whee!\nHoward: Sheldon, I owe you an apology. Taking the train was a stroke of brilliance! I\xe2\x80\x99ve actually got a shot at a Terminator.\nRaj: Oh, please.When it comes to Terminators, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got a better shot of scoring with Arnold Schwarzenegger.\nHoward: You\xe2\x80\x99re overlooking something. I have 11 hours with her in a confined space. Unless she\xe2\x80\x99s willing to jump off a moving train, tuck and roll down the side of a hill, she will eventually succumb to the acquired taste that is Howard Wolowitz.\nLeonard: My money\xe2\x80\x99s on tuck and roll.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m confused. I thought you were involved in some sort of socially intimate pairing with Leslie Winkle.\nHoward: Sheldon, let me explain to you how this works.\nSheldon: All right.\nHoward: That\xe2\x80\x99s Summer Glau.\nSheldon: Yes.\nHoward: That\xe2\x80\x99s it.\nRaj: Hang on a sec. Why do you get first crack at her?\nHoward: Um, well, let\xe2\x80\x99s see, couple reasons. One, I saw her first.\nRaj: No, you didn\xe2\x80\x99t. I did.\nHoward: Fair enough. But then let me move on to number two, unlike you, I can actually talk to women when I\xe2\x80\x99m sober.\nRaj: You fail to take into account that even mute, I am foreign and exotic, while you, on the other hand, are frail and pasty.\nHoward: Well, you know the old saying, pasty and frail never fail.\nLeonard: Excuse me, but what about me? Why don\xe2\x80\x99t I get a shot?\nHoward: Fine, go ahead. Take a shot.\nLeonard: You know, I\xe2\x80\x99ve already got a gorgeous blonde back home at I can\xe2\x80\x99t score with. I think I\xe2\x80\x99ll let you two take this one.\nRaj: Sheldon, is there a place on this train to get alcohol?\nSheldon: Interesting that you ask. The Coast Starlight recently added the refurbished Pacific Parlour Car. Built in 1956 and originally known as the Santa Fe Lounge Car, the lower level is a theatre\xe2\x80\xa6\nRaj: Yeah-yeah, which way?\nSheldon: and the upper level is a bar that offers wine tastings if you\xe2\x80\x99re going as far as Portland.\nLeonard: So aren\xe2\x80\x99t you going to go talk to her?\nHoward: I will, I\xe2\x80\x99m just working on my opening line.\nLeonard: She\xe2\x80\x99s probably heard every possible line, Howard. Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you just try hello?\nHoward: No, no, no, that always creeps girls out. I need to come up with something that\xe2\x80\x99s funny, smart and delicately suggests that my sexual endowment is disproportionate to my physical stature.\nLeonard: You\xe2\x80\x99re going to need more than 11 hours.\nSheldon: Oh, no.\nLeonard: What\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\nSheldon: I forgot my flash drive.\nLeonard: So?\nSheldon: So we have to go back.\nLeonard: Okay, Sheldon, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to say why and your answer cannot be because I forgot my flash drive.\nSheldon: You don\xe2\x80\x99t understand. My flash drive has my paper on astrophysical probes of M-theory effects in the early universe that I was going to give to George Smoot at the conference.\nLeonard: Why do you have to give your paper to George Smoot?\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s brilliant. He needs to read it.\nLeonard: So you\xe2\x80\x99ll send him an e-mail when we get back.\nSheldon: Then I won\xe2\x80\x99t get to see his face light up as he reads it.\nLeonard: Right. Of course.\nSheldon: Oh, this is an unmitigated disaster.\nLeonard: Well, there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing you can do about it, so relax, sit back, enjoy the clickety-clack of the steel wheels on the polished rails.\nSheldon: You forgot your flash drive, You forgot your flash drive (repeated over and over in time to the sound of the train)\nLeonard: Only ten hours, 55 minutes to go.\nTime Shift.\n  Howard (steeling himself to talk to Summer Glau, to himself): It\xe2\x80\x99s hot in here. Must be Summer. (Walks towards her, then walks straight past. Returns, makes to talk to her, then turns to two nuns over the other side of the corridor) So, where you gals headed?\nSheldon: Okay, I\xe2\x80\x99ve found the perfect solution. We get off the train at the next stop in Oxnard. We then take the 1:13 train back to Union Station. We take a cab back to the apartment, get my flash drive, and then race to San Luis Obispo, where, assuming the lights are with us and minimal traffic, we\xe2\x80\x99ll meet the train.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a better idea.\nSheldon: Are you going to be sarcastic?\nLeonard: Boy, you take all the fun out of it for me.  But look, Penny\xe2\x80\x99s home. Why don\xe2\x80\x99t we just call her, have her go in the apartment, get your flash drive and e-mail you the paper?\nSheldon: But the flash drive is in a locked drawer in my desk.\nLeonard: So?\nSheldon: The key is hidden in my room.\nLeonard: So?\nSheldon: Penny would have to go into my room.\nLeonard: So?\nSheldon: People don\xe2\x80\x99t go in my room!\nLeonard: I see. Well, it seems once again, you\xe2\x80\x99re caught between a rock and a crazy place.\nSheldon: Oh, I hate when that happens.\nHoward (to self): It\xe2\x80\x99s hot in here. It must be Summer. It\xe2\x80\x99s hot in here. Must be Summer. It\xe2\x80\x99s hot in here. Must be Summer.\nRaj (walking past and straight up to Summer Glau): It\xe2\x80\x99s hot in here. Must be Summer.\nSummer: That\xe2\x80\x99s cute.\nRaj: Really? I just made it up. Have you seen Slumdog Millionaire?\nSummer: Oh, yeah, I loved it.\nRaj: It\xe2\x80\x99s loosely based on my life.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment. Penny is on the phone.\nPenny: Yeah, we\xe2\x80\x99re putting the play on for one night in this little 99-seat theatre. Can you come? Oh, great. Do you know 98 other people that might want to come? Oh, hang on. (Switches to another line) Hello?\nSheldon (on phone): Listen carefully. I\xe2\x80\x99m about to give you a set of instructions, which you must follow to the letter.\nPenny: Just a sec. (Switches back to first line) The theatre is above a bowling alley, so it\xe2\x80\x99s a little noisy, but it might be the only chance I\xe2\x80\x99ll ever get to play Anne Frank. And the director is brilliant. He uses the bowling sounds as, like, Nazi artillery. Okay, great, I\xe2\x80\x99ll see you then. (Switches line again) Hello?\nSheldon: Okay, step four. Do you see that small plastic case on my dresser?\nPenny: Your dresser? Who is this?\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s Sheldon.\nPenny: Oh, hey, Sheldon! How is San Francisco?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m not in San Francisco. I\xe2\x80\x99m on a train. Were you even listening to me?\nPenny: Uh, no, I was talking to my friend, but what\xe2\x80\x99s up?\nSheldon: What\xe2\x80\x99s up? I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what\xe2\x80\x99s up. I\xe2\x80\x99m in a crisis situation, and I need you to marshal your powers of concentration, limited as they may be\xe2\x80\xa6\nLeonard: Give me the phone. Hi, Penny. It\xe2\x80\x99s Leonard.\nPenny: Hey, Leonard. What\xe2\x80\x99s going on with Dr. Wackadoodle?\nLeonard: He\xe2\x80\x99s calling to ask you a favour. You might be confused because he didn\xe2\x80\x99t use the words, Penny, Sheldon, please or favour.\nSheldon: Okay. Enough chitchat. Okay, step one, locate your emergency key to our apartment. Step two, enter our apartment. Step three, enter my bedroom.\nPenny: Oh, hang on, Sheldon, getting another call.\nSheldon: No! Leonard, let me tell you something. Personal robots cannot get here soon enough.\nRaj: And that bright little star peeking her head out early today, that\xe2\x80\x99s Venus.\nSummer: That is so cool. You really know a lot about space.\nRaj: Come on. When you were on TV in Firefly, you were actually in space.\nSummer: You\xe2\x80\x99re not one of those guys who really believe that, are you?\nRaj: You mean one of the hopeless geeks? No. Those are crazy people. Howard, be a dear and get me another one of these. Now, him, he\xe2\x80\x99s one of those geeks.\nSheldon: All right, now, before you enter my bedroom unescorted, I need you to understand that this onetime grant of access does not create a permanent easement. Easement. It\xe2\x80\x99s a legal right\nof access. Good grief. What? No, don\xe2\x80\x99t put me on hold. Oh!\nHoward: Do you believe him? Normally around women, he has the personality of a boiled potato. Put one beer in him, and he\xe2\x80\x99s M. Night Charmalarmalon.\nLeonard: Is that what he\xe2\x80\x99s drinking? It\xe2\x80\x99s not even real beer.\nHoward: What?\nLeonard: Look at it. Non-alcoholic beer.\nHoward: What\xe2\x80\x99s going on?\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Some sort of placebo effect, I guess.\nHoward: Placebo, you say. Interesting.\nSheldon: Yes, I\xe2\x80\x99m still here. Where am I going? I\xe2\x80\x99m on a train. Now, what you\xe2\x80\x99ll be looking for is a small wooden box located between a Hoberman\xe2\x80\x99s sphere and a sample of quartz flecked with pyrite. Hoberman\xe2\x80\x99s Sphere. It\xe2\x80\x99s a collapsible icosidodecahedron. No, the thing with the time on it is my alarm clock.\nRaj: Actually, in India, the names of constellations are different. Where you have the Big Dipper, we have the Big Curry Pot.\nSummer: You\xe2\x80\x99re making that up.\nRaj: You got me. Now what are you going to do with me?\nHoward: Raj.\nRaj: Yes?\nHoward: Look.\nRaj: What am I looking at?\nHoward: You tell me.\nRaj: Non-alcoholic bee-ee-eeuh (Runs off)\nHoward: Hi, I\xe2\x80\x99m the small package good things come in.\nPenny: Okay, I got a box, but there\xe2\x80\x99s no key in here. Just letters.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s the wrong box. Put it back.\nPenny: Oh, Sheldon, are these letters from your grandmother?\nSheldon: Don\xe2\x80\x99t read those letters!\nPenny: Oh, look, she calls you Moon Pie. That is so cute.\nSheldon: Put down the letters!\nLeonard: Hey, Penny. It\xe2\x80\x99s Leonard.\nPenny: Hey, Leonard. How\xe2\x80\x99s the train ride?\nLeonard: Delightful. Listen, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you\xe2\x80\x99re doing right now, but there are little bubbles forming on the corners of Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s mouth.\nPenny: Okay, yeah, I kind of crossed a line. Put him back on.\nLeonard: Thank you.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m back.\nPenny: What up, Moon Pie?\nSheldon: Nobody calls me Moon Pie but Meemaw!\nLeonard: Hey, Penny. Leonard again.\nHoward: So anyway, in the dream, you and I were ice skating, just the two of us. And then, I picked you up by your ankles and twirled you round and round until your legs tore off. I tried to stick them back on, but before I could, you turned into a giant loaf of pumpernickel bread. What do you think that means?\nSummer (uncomfortable): I really don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you a little clue. My favourite sandwich? Salami on pumpernickel.\nSummer: Is that so?\nHoward: And did you know the word \xe2\x80\x9cpumpernickel\xe2\x80\x9d comes from the German words pumper and nickel, which loosely translates to fart goblin?\nSummer: No. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t.\nPenny: Okay, I found the box. Now what?\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re holding a Japanese puzzle box, which takes ten precise moves to open. First, locate the panel with the diamond pattern and slide the centre portion one millimetre to the left. Then, on the opposite end of the box, slide the entire panel down two millimetres. You\xe2\x80\x99ll hear a slight click.\nPenny: Hang on. Sheldon, do you have any emotional attachment to this box?\nSheldon: No, it\xe2\x80\x99s a novelty I ordered off the Internet. Now, did you hear the click?\nPenny: Not yet. (Puts box on ground and stomps on it)There it is.\nHoward: Okay, here\xe2\x80\x99s another one. If you married the famous rock guitarist Johnny Winter, you\xe2\x80\x99d be Summer Winter.\nSummer: Uh-huh.\nHoward: Okay, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to just go for broke here and say I like you.\nSummer: Yeah?\nHoward: So here\xe2\x80\x99s my question, do you realistically see any conversational path that would take me from where we are right now to a place where I could ask you out and you\xe2\x80\x99d say yes?\nSummer: No.\nHoward: Fair enough. I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave you in peace.\nSummer: Thank you.\nHoward: But before I go, would you mind if I just take one picture of us together for my Facebook page?\nSummer: Sure.\nHoward: Okay. Great. Now, can I take one where it looks like we\xe2\x80\x99re making out?\nSheldon: Okay, now you\xe2\x80\x99re going to insert the flash drive into the USB port. She calls me Moon Pie because I\xe2\x80\x99m nummy-nummy and she could just eat me up, now, please put the flash drive in the USB port. The one that looks like a little duck\xe2\x80\x99s mouth.\nLeonard: Hey, how\xe2\x80\x99d it go?\nHoward: Terminator broke my phone.\nLeonard: Excuse me. (Goes down to Summer) Okay, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be honest with you. I\xe2\x80\x99ve just spent the last two hours imagining various scenarios in my head, trying to come up with some clever line to say to you. But then I finally realized you\xe2\x80\x99re a human being; I\xe2\x80\x99m a human being. I could just say to you\xe2\x80\xa6\nAnnouncer: Next stop: Santa Barbara.\nSummer: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. This is me.\nLeonard: Hi, my name\xe2\x80\x99s Leonard.\nScene: The conference.\nSheldon: So, I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking, you won the Nobel Prize what, three years ago? So you must deal with a whole lot of what has Smoot done lately? My thought is we continue my research as a team, you know, Cooper-Smoot, alphabetical, and when we win the Nobel Prize, you\xe2\x80\x99ll be back on top.\nGeorge Smoot: With all due respect, Dr. Cooper, are you on crack?\nSheldon: Fine! Smoot-Cooper. Wow, what a diva.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
