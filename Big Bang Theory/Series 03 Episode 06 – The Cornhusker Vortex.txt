b'Scene: The stairwell. The guys are carrying kites.\nLeonard: Kites, ho!\nHoward: Kites ho!\nRaj: Kites ho!\nAll three: Kites, ho!\nSheldon: Excuse me. You\xe2\x80\x99re misusing the word ho. It\xe2\x80\x99s an interjection used to call attention to a destination, not an object, as in, uh, Land, ho! Or, uh, Westward, ho!\nThe three guys: Kites, ho!\nPenny: Hey, guys. What you doing? Going out to discover electricity?\nLeonard: If you\xe2\x80\x99re referring to the work of Benjamin Franklin, he did not discover electricity, he merely used a kite to determine that lightning consists of electricity. He also invented the Franklin stove, bifocals and the flexible urinary catheter. Kites, ho.\nLeonard: We\xe2\x80\x99re heading out for some kite fighting.\nPenny: Kite fighting?\nLeonard: Oh, yeah. It\xe2\x80\x99s an extremely competitive, cutthroat sport.\nSheldon: Well, actually, the risk of throat cutting is very low. On the other hand, severe string burn is a real and ever-Present danger.\nLeonard: You want to come watch?\nPenny: Oh, gee, sounds amazing, but, um, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got some friends coming over. Not a big thing, we\xe2\x80\x99re just gonna watch the Nebraska game.\nLeonard: Oh. Football, sure.\nHoward: Good guess.\nPenny: I would\xe2\x80\x99ve invited you, but I know you\xe2\x80\x99re not a football fan.\nLeonard: No, no, I\xe2\x80\x99m not, so, great. You\xe2\x80\x99ve got plans doing something you like, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got plans doing something I like, so it\xe2\x80\x99s good.\nPenny: Well, maybe we\xe2\x80\x99ll hang out later, you know, after everybody\xe2\x80\x99s gone.\nLeonard: Yeah, great.\nPenny: See ya.\nLeonard: Well, this sucks.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, I got bored and drifted off. Where exactly in the interaction did the sucking lie?\nRaj: Leonard just realized that Penny\xe2\x80\x99s been hiding him from her friends because he\xe2\x80\x99s a tiny, little man who flies kites.\nSheldon: Oh, that certainly would suck.\nCredits sequence.\n  Scene: The park.\nSheldon: Wolowitz is trying to outflank us. Let out some string, add altitude and I\xe2\x80\x99ll go under and cut his line.\nLeonard: Why wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t Penny want her friends to meet me?\nSheldon: Focus, Leonard, focus! The heat of battle is upon us, the dogs of war are unleashed.\nLeonard: Maybe Koothrappali\xe2\x80\x99s right, maybe I embarrass her.\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re embarrassing me right now, a grown man worrying about such nonsense when in the middle of flying kites.\nLeonard: Sorry.\nSheldon: Sorry won\xe2\x80\x99t bring their kites down. Ow! String burn! String burn!\nRaj: Oh, they think we\xe2\x80\x99re flanking, they\xe2\x80\x99re playing right into our hands. On the count of three, we execute the flying scissor. One, two\xe2\x80\xa6\nHoward: Whoa! Did you see that?\nRaj: See what?\nHoward: That chick, she smiled at me.\nRaj: No, she didn\xe2\x80\x99t.\nHoward: Yes, she did.\nRaj: Come on, scissors, scissors!\nHoward: Hold my line.\nRaj: Wait, what are you doing? I can\xe2\x80\x99t scissors by myself! Howard! Come back!\nSheldon: Victory!\nRaj: Son of a bitch.\nScene: Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s car.\nRaj: You\xe2\x80\x99re a sucky friend, you know that? A sucky, sucky friend.\nHoward: What was I supposed to do? She gave me that come-hither look.\nRaj: If she gave you any look at l. It was a you suck look.\nHoward: I would\xe2\x80\x99ve caught up to her if I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t pulled a hammy.\nRaj: Oh, please, you weigh 80 pounds. You don\xe2\x80\x99t have a hammy.\nLeonard: So, Penny doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want me around her friends, I embarrass her. What else could it be?\nSheldon: Well, her actions could be out of concern for your feelings. Perhaps she\xe2\x80\x99s excluded you from these gatherings because she\xe2\x80\x99s scouting for a new mate and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to do it in front of you.\nLeonard: Oh, how kind of her.\nSheldon: Agreed. Most primates don\xe2\x80\x99t show that sort of discretion. A female bonobo will copulate with a new male in front of the old one without so much as a how do you do?\nRaj: You always do this, you know? You ditch me for a woman you don\xe2\x80\x99t have a shot with.\nHoward: I totally had a shot.\nRaj: With a woman you were chasing through a park? That\xe2\x80\x99s not a shot, that\xe2\x80\x99s a felony. What\xe2\x80\x99s worse, it cost me my prized Patang fighting kite. Sheldon, I don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose there\xe2\x80\x99s any chance you could give me my kite back?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, Raj, but the rules of aerial warfare dictate at the fallen kite go to the victor. And without rules, the competition has no meaning. And without meaning, the following would be an empty gesture. (Sings) I have your kite. I have your kite.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nLeonard: Hey.\nPenny: Hi.\nLeonard: How was your football party?\nPenny: It was pretty good. We won.\nLeonard: Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s excellent. It\xe2\x80\x99s a weird figure of speech, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it, we won when you weren\xe2\x80\x99t\nactually playing. When we watch Star Wars, we don\xe2\x80\x99t say, we defeated the Empire.\nPenny: I\xe2\x80\x99m glad to hear it.\nLeonard: Oh, hey, on a related subject, are you embarrassed to have me around your friends?\nPenny: Oh, my god, no. Why would you ask that?\nLeonard: Well, you know, I just noticed I haven\xe2\x80\x99t really met any of them.\nPenny: Sure you have.\nLeonard: Well, yeah, no, I met the huge ex-boyfriend and the smaller yet still larger than me ex-boyfriend. Were they here today?\nPenny: Of course not.\nLeonard: Of course not. Why would they be? Why would I ask? Why am I rambling? Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you stop me?\nPenny: Leonard, look, if you want to meet my friends, that would be great. I just, you know, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want you to be bored.\nLeonard: I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be bored. Why would I be bored?\nPenny: Well, \xe2\x80\x99cause they\xe2\x80\x99re not genius scientists.\nLeonard: Penny, I like all sorts of people. In fact, some of my best friends aren\xe2\x80\x99t geniuses.\nPenny: Like who?\nLeonard: Okay, some of my Facebook friends aren\xe2\x80\x99t geniuses. My point is, if we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be a couple, I should be friends with your friends.\nPenny: Okay, great. Well, then why don\xe2\x80\x99t you come over next Saturday and watch the game with us.\nLeonard: Another football game?\nPenny: They have them every week.\nLeonard: Did not know that.\nPenny: You wanted to meet my friends.\nLeonard: Sure, sure, just I don\xe2\x80\x99t know much about football.\nPenny: Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s okay, a lot of the guys\xe2\x80\x99 girlfriends don\xe2\x80\x99t know football. They just kind of drink and talk in the kitchen.\nLeonard: Great.\nScene: The apartment. Leonard and Raj are watching a football game on the television.\nLeonard: Okay, a complete pass. First down, New England. I think I\xe2\x80\x99m starting to get this.\nRaj: Really? The only thing I\xe2\x80\x99ve learned in the last two hours is that American men love drinking beer, pee too often and have trouble getting erections.\nLeonard: Focus on the game, not the commercials, Raj.\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99m just saying, maybe if you people cut back on the beer, you could get out of the bathroom and satisfy your women without pharmaceutical help.\nHoward (arriving): Raj, what are you doing here? You were supposed to help me pimp out my Vespa.\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, are you under the impression that we\xe2\x80\x99re still friends?\nHoward: Oh come on, you\xe2\x80\x99re not still grinding on the kite thing, are you?\nRaj: It\xe2\x80\x99s not just the kite thing. Every time we go some place, you think you can just dump me whenever someone prettier comes along, even though you don\xe2\x80\x99t have a shot with them.\nHoward: But I had a shot with that jogger.\nRaj: Fine. Paint green flames on your little scooter with her. (Leaves)\nHoward: It\xe2\x80\x99s not a little scooter. It\xe2\x80\x99s the second biggest Vespa they make! Are you watching football?\nLeonard: There\xe2\x80\x99s no fooling you. Now, what is this sacks statistic they put up there?\nHoward: All I know about Saks is, my mother shops there.\nLeonard: Sacks, sacks\xe2\x80\xa6\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s football nomenclature for when a quarterback is tackled behind the line of scrimmage.\nLeonard: Huh\xe2\x80\xa6 Scrimmage\xe2\x80\xa6\nSheldon: The line of scrimmage is the imaginary transverse line separating the offence from the defence.\nLeonard: Oh.\nHoward: Sheldon knows football?\nLeonard: Apparently.\nHoward: I mean, Quidditch, sure. But football?\nLeonard: Sheldon, how do you know this stuff?\nSheldon: I grew up in Texas. Football is ubiquitous in Texas. Pro football, college football, high school football, peewee football, in fact, every form of football except the original, European football, which most Texans believe to be a Commie plot.\nLeonard: Unbelievable.\nSheldon: If you\xe2\x80\x99re interested, I also know all about frying meat that isn\xe2\x80\x99t chicken as if it were chicken.\nLeonard: So you could teach me?\nSheldon: Football or chicken-fried meats?\nLeonard: Football. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to Penny\xe2\x80\x99s on Saturday to watch a game with her friends and I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to look like an idiot. I want to blend in.\nSheldon: If you want to blend in with Penny\xe2\x80\x99s friends, I\xe2\x80\x99d think looking like an idiot would be the perfect camouflage.\nLeonard: Come on, Sheldon, please teach me about football. It\xe2\x80\x99ll be fun.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what my father said. Come to the games, watch the games, week in and week out from the time I was five until I went off to college. Longest seven years of my life.\nLeonard: Please, I\xe2\x80\x99m asking you as a friend.\nSheldon: Are you making this a tier one friendship request?\nLeonard: Yes.\nSheldon: Fine.\nLeonard: I really appreciate this.\nSheldon: Yeah, yeah. All right, Poindexter, sit down, shut up and listen.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry?\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s how my father always began our football conversations. And if you\xe2\x80\x99d like, after the game, I\xe2\x80\x99ll take you outside and teach you how to shoot close enough to a racoon that it craps itself.\nScene: The kitchen. Sheldon is making toast in a cylon toaster which burns an image of a cylon onto the toast.\n  Leonard: When are you going to stop making Cylon toast?\nSheldon: When I have enough to destroy all the human toast on the battlestar known as Galactica. Is that what you\xe2\x80\x99re wearing to watch football at Penny\xe2\x80\x99s?\nLeonard: What\xe2\x80\x99s wrong with a football jersey?\nSheldon: Nothing. That, however, appears to be a football cocktail dress.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99s the smallest size they had, except the one for dogs. I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe they had one for dogs.\nSheldon: Oh, yes. Canine football fans are a common sight in Texas. Cats, however, refuse to wear sporting apparel. My sister found that out the hard way.\nLeonard: Anyway, wish me luck.\nSheldon: Leonard, wait. Am I correct in assuming that your attempt to be accepted by Penny\xe2\x80\x99s peers is based on your desire to ensure your continuing mating privileges with her?\nLeonard: Well, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t put it exactly that way.\nSheldon: How would you put it?\nLeonard: Yeah, okay, like you said.\nSheldon: Huh. Seems like an awful lot of trouble to go through for intercourse. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you have access to women who will do it for money? By the way, another accepted usage for the term ho.\nLeonard: Good-Bye, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Hold on I believe that social convention dictate you not arrive empty-Handed. Would you like to bring some Cylon toast?\nLeonard: Yeah, no, I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to fit in, not get laughed at.\nSheldon: What\xe2\x80\x99s funny about Cylon toast?\nScene: Raj\xe2\x80\x99s apartment. Raj is watching a Bollywood movie. There is a knock on the door.\nRaj: It\xe2\x80\x99s open.\nHoward: Hey, pal.\nRaj: What do you want?\nHoward: I brought you a little gift. New kite.\nRaj: The kite you made me lose was an authentic Patang, an Indian fighting kite that my brother sent to me from New Delhi. It took me a day to put together and two days to paint. This is Hello Kitty.\nHoward: Yeah, but it comes with a little coin purse. Does a Patang?\nRaj: Wow, you just don\xe2\x80\x99t get it, do you? Buying me something pretty isn\xe2\x80\x99t going to make our problem just go away.\nHoward: Look, I admit I haven\xe2\x80\x99t always been the best friend I could be.\nRaj: You\xe2\x80\x99ve been a sucky friend, a sucky, sucky friend.\nHoward: Stipulated.\nRaj: And you do it all the time. Last week in the mall at Radio Shack, we were looking for a phone with giant numbers for your mother, and I suddenly realize you\xe2\x80\x99re not even there.\nHoward: I know, I know.\nRaj: And where were you?\nHoward: Getting shot down by the girl at Hot Dog on a Stick. But in my defence, she was gorgeous, and working that squeezer to make the lemonade, going up and down and up and down. It was like a free pole dance right in the middle of the food court.\nRaj: You\xe2\x80\x99re impossible.\nHoward: Hey, at least I can talk to women without being drunk.\nRaj: Excuse me, I have selective mutism, a recognized medical disorder. You\xe2\x80\x99re just a douche.\nHoward: No. You know what? Maybe that\xe2\x80\x99s what this whole thing\xe2\x80\x99s about. You\xe2\x80\x99re not mad at me, you\xe2\x80\x99re mad at yourself.\nRaj: No, I\xe2\x80\x99m mad at you. I hate myself, but I\xe2\x80\x99m mad at you.\nHoward: Fine. You\xe2\x80\x99re mad at me. I get it. Now, how about we go spend the day together? Just the two of us. We\xe2\x80\x99ll go anywhere you want.\nRaj: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\nHoward: Come on. Let me take you someplace nice.\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\xa6 I do enjoy the La Brea Tar Pits.\nHoward: Really, now? With the traffic and the parking, it\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\xa6 okay, fine. The Tar Pits. Let\xe2\x80\x99s go.\nRaj: Oh, why can\xe2\x80\x99t I stay mad at you?\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment. Everyone is watching football.\nLeonard: Go! Go! Go! Go-Go-Go-Go! Yes! Are you people watching this? Is this amazing or what?\nPenny: Sweetie, that\xe2\x80\x99s a highlight from the \xe2\x80\x9998 championship game.\nLeonard: Oh. Did not know that.\nPenny: How much beer have you had?\nLeonard: None, why?\nPenny: Oh. I was just kind of hoping you were drunk. Now we\xe2\x80\x99re back live.\nLeonard: Okay, yeah. I can see the difference.\nGuy in baseball hat: Oh, where\xe2\x80\x99s the flag, that\xe2\x80\x99s intentional grounding.\nSecond guy: Totally.\nLeonard: That completely was a forward pass, which they threw intentionally incomplete to avoid loss of yardage or to conserve time. I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe they\xe2\x80\x99re not being penalized with the loss of a down and by having to move the line of scrimmage back to the spot of the foul.\nPenny: Here, have some pizza, sweetie.\nLeonard: Penny, you know I\xe2\x80\x99m lactose intolerant.\nPenny: I know. I just need you stop talking.\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny.\nPenny: Sheldon, come in.\nSheldon: Thank you. I\xe2\x80\x99d like to make a sandwich, but I\xe2\x80\x99m out of bread.\nPenny: There\xe2\x80\x99s some in the fridge.\nSheldon: You shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t keep your bread in the refrigerator. Staleness is caused by crystallization of the starch molecules, which occurs faster at cool temperatures.\nPenny: On Earth, we say thank you.\nSheldon: So Leonard, how goes the mimesis?\nLeonard: Mimesis?\nSheldon: You know. Mimesis. An action in which the mimic takes on the properties of a specific object or organism. Mimesis.\nLeonard: What the hell are you talking about?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m attempting to communicate with you without my meaning becoming apparent to those around you. Let me try again. Have the indigenous fauna accepted you as one of their own? Nudge, nudge, wink, wink.\nLeonard: Oh, I guess so.\nSheldon: Good. Oh, FYI. After I eat my sandwich, I\xe2\x80\x99m taking Koothrappali\xe2\x80\x99s Patang kite out for a test run. Would you like to get your delta-wing raptor and join me?\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to fly kites, Sheldon. We\xe2\x80\x99re watching football here.\nSheldon: I can see that. I was providing you with an alternative. A courtesy I was never offered in similar circumstances.\nLeonard: Oh, look at that. The Oklahoma coach has thrown down a red flag indicating he\xe2\x80\x99s challenging the ruling on the field. I hope he\xe2\x80\x99s right, \xe2\x80\x99cause if he\xe2\x80\x99s not, it\xe2\x80\x99ll cost him one of his three time-Outs.\nPenny: You know, Leonard, honey, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t mind if you wanted to go fly kites with Sheldon.\nLeonard: No, I\xe2\x80\x99ll watch the end of the game. Besides, there\xe2\x80\x99s only three minutes left.\nPenny: Until half time.\nLeonard: This is just half? We\xe2\x80\x99ve been here for hours.\nPenny: And you\xe2\x80\x99re gonna be here for a couple more.\nLeonard: Oh, you\xe2\x80\x99re kidding me.\nPenny: No.\nLeonard: Nice meeting all of you.\nPenny: So, yeah, anyway, that\xe2\x80\x99s my boyfriend. He is really smart.\nScene: The Le Brea Tar Pits.\nRaj: I really like my saber-toothed cat. Thank you.\nHoward: My pleasure. Maybe after lunch, we can go to Marie Callender\xe2\x80\x99s and have some pie.\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99d like that. This is turning out to be a perfect Saturday.\nHoward: Good. I\xe2\x80\x99m glad. Oh, man. Did you see the way she smiled at me?\nRaj: Fine. Go ahead.\nHoward: No. This is our day.\nRaj: If you want to chase after her, chase after her.\nHoward: Ah, who am I kidding? I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have a shot with a girl like that.\nRaj: Don\xe2\x80\x99t put yourself down. You\xe2\x80\x99re a very attractive man.\nHoward: You think so?\nRaj: Yeah. Absolutely. It wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t kill you to take a Pilates class with me now and then, but you have a certain wiry appeal.\nHoward: Yeah, well, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter \xe2\x80\x98cause she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t really smiling at me.\nRaj: Actually, in this case, I think she was.\nHoward: Really?\nRaj: Yeah.\nHoward: Bye.\nRaj: What a douche.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
