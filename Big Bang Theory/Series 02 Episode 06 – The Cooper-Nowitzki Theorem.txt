b'Scene: A lecture room at the university.\nLeonard: So, if any of you are considering going into experimental physics, my door is always open. Once again, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry that the demonstration didn\xe2\x80\x99t quite work out, but now we know what happens when you accidentally spill peach Snapple into a helium neon laser. Short answer is\xe2\x80\xa6 don\xe2\x80\x99t. And now to tell you about the theoretical physics department is Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Dr. Cooper?\nSheldon (off): Forget it.\nLeonard: Excuse me. Sheldon, we both agreed to do this.\nSheldon (off): It\xe2\x80\x99s a waste of time. I might as well explain the laws of thermodynamics to a bunch of labradoodles.\nLeonard: If you don\xe2\x80\x99t do this, I won\xe2\x80\x99t take you to the comic book store.\nSheldon (entering): Hello. Nice work with the laser, by the way. Looking out at your fresh young faces, I remember when I too was deciding my academic future as a lowly graduate student. Of course, I was 14, and I\xe2\x80\x99d already achieved more than most of you could ever hope to, despite my 9 o\xe2\x80\x99clock bedtime. Now, there may be one or two of you in this room who has what it takes to succeed in theoretical physics, although, it\xe2\x80\x99s more likely that you\xe2\x80\x99ll spend your scientific careers teaching fifth graders how to make paper mache volcanoes with baking soda lava.\nLeonard: Oh, good God.\nSheldon: In short, anyone who told you that you would someday be able to make any significant contribution to physics played a cruel trick on you, a cruel trick indeed. Any questions? Of course not. I weep for the future of science. Now if you\xe2\x80\x99ll excuse me, the latest issue of Batman is out. Come, Leonard.\nLeonard: Laser demonstration\xe2\x80\x99s looking pretty good now, huh?\nCredits sequence.\n  Scene: The university cafeteria.\n  Raj: I love this time of the year. The leaves are turning, there\xe2\x80\x99s a bracing chill in the air.\nHoward: Plus there\xe2\x80\x99s a whole new crop of female grad students about to put on just enough winter weight to make them needy and vulnerable. That\xe2\x80\x99s right, honey, have another calzone, Daddy can wait.\nRaj: Isn\xe2\x80\x99t there a university policy against dating graduate students?\nLeonard: No, if you can talk to them, you can ask them out.\nRaj: Damn, there\xe2\x80\x99s always a catch.\nLeslie Winkle (entering): Hey, guys.\nLeonard: Hey, Leslie.\nLeslie: So, dumbass, I heard you made a grad student throw up last night.\nSheldon: The truth can indeed be a finger down the throat of those unprepared to hear it. But why should I cater to second-rate minds?\nLeslie: Because first-rate minds call you \xe2\x80\x9cdumbass\xe2\x80\x9d?\nSheldon: Oh, yeah? Well\xe2\x80\xa6 you\xe2\x80\x99re a mean person.\nGirl (arriving): Excuse me, Dr. Cooper, I\xe2\x80\x99m Ramona Nowitzki, I was at your talk last night. I think you\xe2\x80\x99re just brilliant.\nSheldon: That is the prevailing opinion.\nLeslie: Oh, now I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna throw up.\nHoward: Howard Wolowitz, department of engineering, co-designer of the International Space Station\xe2\x80\x99s Liquid Waste Disposal System.\nRamona: Ew. Dr. Cooper, I\xe2\x80\x99ve read everything you\xe2\x80\x99ve published. I especially liked your paper on grand unification using string-network condensates and was wondering how you determined that three-dimensional string-nets provided a unified picture of fermions and gauge bosons?\nSheldon: Amazing, an intelligent labradoodle.\nHoward: Woof.\nSheldon: The fact is I\xe2\x80\x99m quite close to a breakthrough in showing how neutrinos emerge from a string-net condensate.\nRamona: Oh, my God, that would change the way we view the entire physical universe.\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s what I do.\nHoward: You know, the Pishkin-Wolowitz Liquid Waste Disposal System is turning a few heads as well.\nRamona: Again, ew. You know, I\xe2\x80\x99d love to hear more about how you intend to add neutrinos. Could we get a cup of coffee sometime?\nSheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t drink coffee.\nHoward: I do. I love me a cup of joe.\nRamona: Well, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have to be coffee. How about dinner?\nSheldon: I do eat dinner.\nRamona: Great. I know a terrific little Italian place.\nSheldon: I never eat in strange restaurants. One runs the risk of non-standard cutlery.\nRamona: Excuse me?\nLeonard: Sheldon lives in fear of the three-tined fork.\nSheldon: Three tines is not a fork, three tines is a trident. Forks are for eating, tridents are for ruling the seven seas.\nRamona: What if I brought food to your place?\nSheldon: That would be acceptable. On Mondays, I eat Thai food. Mee krob and chicken sate with extra peanut sauce from Siam Palace.\nRamona: You got it. I already have your address.\nSheldon: What a nice girl.\nHoward: Sheldon, do you have any idea what just happened?\nSheldon: Yes. Apparently I\xe2\x80\x99m getting a free dinner.\nScene: The apartment building lobby. Ramona is waiting by the lift. Penny enters.\n  Penny: Oh, yeah, no, this thing\xe2\x80\x99s majorly out of order. (Picking up out of order sign) See? Sorry.\nRamona: That\xe2\x80\x99s okay. Guess I\xe2\x80\x99m taking the stairs.\nPenny: Where you going?\nRamona: 4-A.\nPenny: Oh, are you here to see Leonard?\nRamona: No, Dr. Cooper.\nPenny: Dr. Sheldon Cooper?\nRamona: We\xe2\x80\x99re having dinner.\nPenny: Sheldon Cooper? Tall, thin, looks a little like a giant praying mantis?\nRamona: He is cute, isn\xe2\x80\x99t he?\nPenny: Sheldon Cooper?\nScene: The apartment. Leonard opens the door, Ramona and Penny are outside.\n  Ramona: Hi, Leonard.\nLeonard: Hey, Ramona. Come on in.\nRamona: Thanks. Where should I put this?\nLeonard: Uh, the kitchen\xe2\x80\x99s fine. (To Penny) Hey, what are you doing?\nPenny: I need to see this.\nLeonard: Uh-huh. The viewing area\xe2\x80\x99s right over there. Sheldon, your girl\xe2\x80\xa6 date\xe2\x80\xa6 person\xe2\x80\xa6 Ramona\xe2\x80\x99s here.\nSheldon: Oh, hello.\nRamona: Oh, sorry I\xe2\x80\x99m late. I just got so caught up reading the draft of your latest paper.\nSheldon: Did you enjoy the humorous footnote where I illustrate mirror-symmetry by likening it to the Flash playing tennis with himself?\nRamona: So funny. But the idea that you might be able to incorporate gravity, I have to tell you, I found it physically exhilarating.\nSheldon: My hypotheses tend to have that effect.\nRamona: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry I didn\xe2\x80\x99t bring enough for your friends. I assumed we were going to be alone.\nLeonard: Oh, yeah. No, we were just going.\nHoward: To watch, right?\nLeonard: No, come on, now, we\xe2\x80\x99re going out.\nPenny: Oh, come on, we\xe2\x80\x99ll be quiet.\nLeonard: Let\xe2\x80\x99s go. Okay, you two, just, have a nice\xe2\x80\xa6 whatever this is.\nPenny (in hallway): Okay, you guys, look, I know this is none of my business, but I just, I have to ask, what\xe2\x80\x99s Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s deal?\nLeonard: What do you mean \xe2\x80\x9cdeal\xe2\x80\x9d?\nPenny: You know, like what\xe2\x80\x99s his deal? Is it girls? Guys? Sock puppets?\nLeonard: Honestly, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been operating under the assumption that he has no deal.\nPenny: Come on, everybody has a deal.\nHoward: Not Sheldon. Over the years, we\xe2\x80\x99ve formulated many theories about how he might reproduce. I\xe2\x80\x99m an advocate of mytosis.\nPenny: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry?\nHoward: I believe one day Sheldon will eat an enormous amount of Thai food and split into two Sheldons.\nLeonard: On the other hand, I think Sheldon might be the larval form of his species, and someday he\xe2\x80\x99ll spin a cocoon and emerge two months later with moth wings and an exoskeleton.\nPenny: Okay, well, thanks for the nightmares.\nLeonard: Hey, do you want to hang out with us?\nPenny: What are you guys gonna do?\nLeonard: Uh\xe2\x80\xa6\nHoward: My mom\xe2\x80\x99s making a brisket tonight.\nLeonard: The one with the little onions? Mmm.\nPenny: Yeah, I\xe2\x80\x99m busy, so, goodnight.\nHoward: Her loss. Let\xe2\x80\x99s go.\nRaj: Brisket party! B-to-the-R-to-the-I-S-K\xe2\x80\xa6 To-the-E-to-the-T\xe2\x80\xa6 Ooh\xe2\x80\xa6\nLeonard: Don\xe2\x80\x99t.\nScene: The cafeteria.\n  Leonard: Hey, aren\xe2\x80\x99t you having breakfast?\nSheldon: Yes.\nLeonard: Are you experimenting with nutritional suppositories again?\nSheldon: Not in these pants.\nLeonard: So, how\xe2\x80\x99d it go with Ramona last night?\nSheldon: Oh, great. She\xe2\x80\x99s smart, insightful and she has a very unique way of, you know, revering me.\nRamona (arriving): Here\xe2\x80\x99s your spinach mushroom omelette .\nSheldon: Thank you. Did anyone touch it?\nRamona: Gloves were worn by everyone involved. I was vigilant.\nSheldon: Ramona pointed out that I\xe2\x80\x99ve been wasting 20 minutes a day standing on cafeteria lines.\nRamona: Time which would be better spent tackling the great physics problems of our day.\nSheldon: You don\xe2\x80\x99t tackle the big issues, Ramona. You fence with them. En garde. Riposte.\nLeonard: Touche.\nLeslie (arriving): Morning.\nLeonard: Ah, hey Leslie.\nLeslie: So, Sheldon, I see you\xe2\x80\x99re organizing your papers for the Smithsonian Museum of Dumbassery.\nRamona: There won\xe2\x80\x99t be any room until they get rid of the permanent Leslie Winkle exhibit.\nSheldon: Oh, good one.\nLeslie: I see you got a grad student to fight your battles for you. I\xe2\x80\x99ll let you keep your lunch money today.\nRamona: Okay, Dr. Cooper is on the verge of a breakthrough. If you\xe2\x80\x99re going to stay, you\xe2\x80\x99ll have to be respectful and quiet. (Leslie leaves. Ramona looks pointedly at Leonard)\nLeonard: Wait for me.\nRamona: So have you worked out the neutrino issue?\nSheldon: Well, to paraphrase Mozart, all the subatomic particles are there, I just have to put them in the right order.\nRamona: You\xe2\x80\x99re so witty.\nSheldon: Aren\xe2\x80\x99t I?\nScene: The apartment. There is a knock on the door which then opens and Penny enters.\nPenny: Hey, guys, this package came for y\xe2\x80\xa6\n(Sheldon is sitting in his usual seat, typing on his laptop. One foot is in a foot spa. Ramona is pumicing the other.)\n  Ramona: Dr. Cooper is working.\nSheldon: Yes, I\xe2\x80\x99m close to a breakthrough. Ooh, it tickles\nPenny: Sorry. (Puts package down and leaves. In hallway, shudders) Holy crap on a cracker.\nLeonard: Hey, Penny.\nPenny: Hi. You know, you probably don\xe2\x80\x99t want to go in there.\nLeonard: Why? What are they doing?\nPenny: You know, the only way I could explain it would be in a therapist\xe2\x80\x99s office with dolls.\nLeonard (enters): Hoo-boy.\nRamona: Dr. Cooper\xe2\x80\x99s working.\nLeonard: Yeah, I can see that. Sheldon, Halo night, Koothrappali\xe2\x80\x99s. You coming?\nSheldon: Oh, yes, it\xe2\x80\x99s Halo night. Let me just dry my tootsies.\nRamona: You\xe2\x80\x99re not going to Halo night.\nSheldon: Yes, I am. It\xe2\x80\x99s Wednesday. Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s Halo night.</i>\nRamona: Didn\xe2\x80\x99t a great man once say, \xe2\x80\x9cScience demands nothing less than the fervent and\nunconditional dedication of our entire lives\xe2\x80\x9d?\nSheldon: He did.\nRamona: And who was that great man?\nSheldon: Me. Sorry, Leonard.\nLeonard: Seriously? You\xe2\x80\x99re not coming?\nSheldon: You heard her. How can I argue with me?\nLeonard: Okay, well, once again, you guys have a good\xe2\x80\xa6 whatever this is.\nRamona: Dr. Cooper, I have to tell you, your friends are holding you back.\nSheldon: I prefer to think of it as I\xe2\x80\x99m pulling them forward.\nRamona: Halo night? A man with your intellectual gifts doesn\xe2\x80\x99t waste an evening playing video games.\nSheldon: He does on Wednesdays.\nRamona: Not if he wants a Nobel Prize.\nSheldon: He does want that. Does a man with my intellectual gifts play paintball on weekends?\nRamona: What do you think?\nSheldon: Drat.\nRamona: Now shall we get back to work?\nSheldon: I suppose. Battlestar Galactica comes on tonight. (Pause) I guess I can wait for the DVD. (Pause) And then never ever watch it.\nMontage of scenes: To the sound of \xe2\x80\x9cYou Can Be My Yoko Ono\xe2\x80\x9d by Barenaked Ladies  we see 1. the guys set off for paintball while Sheldon, dressed in paintball gear, sadly waves them goodbye, 2. Ramona catch Sheldon hiding behind the shower curtain playing on a Nintendo DS, 3. Ramona remove a book Sheldon is reading to reveal a Batman comic underneath, 4. Sheldon escape the apartment in his paintball gear only to be chased back inside by Ramona returning with groceries, she finds him sitting in his underpants with his paintball helmet still on.\n  Scene: Outside Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\n  Sheldon (Knock, knock, knock, in a low voice): Penny, (knock, knock, knock) Penny, (knock, knock, knock) Penny\nPenny: Sheldon, honey, I\xe2\x80\x99ve told you, it\xe2\x80\x99s a small apartment, you only have to knock one time.\nSheldon: Please, please, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a lot of time. Look, Ramona finally dozed off, and I need you to help me get rid of her.\nPenny: Get rid of her how?\nSheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, but apparently I\xe2\x80\x99m in some kind of relationship, and you seem to be an expert at ending them.\nPenny: Excuse me?\nSheldon: I see man after man leaving this apartment never to return.\nPenny: Okay, first of all, it is not man after man.\nRamona (off): Dr. Cooper?!\nSheldon: Hide me.\nPenny: Hide you?\nSheldon: I formally request sanctuary.\nRamona: Why aren\xe2\x80\x99t you working?\nSheldon: Um\xe2\x80\xa6 she distracted me. I told you, Penny, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have time for your nonsense, I have important things to do.\nPenny: Oh, man.\nRamona: I know what\xe2\x80\x99s going on here.\nPenny: Really? Well, then will you explain it to me?\nRamona: You\xe2\x80\x99re in love with Dr. Cooper.\nPenny: Uh, yeah, no, that\xe2\x80\x99s not it.\nRamona: Don\xe2\x80\x99t try to deny it. He\xe2\x80\x99s a remarkable man, but you have to let him go.\nPenny: Oh, gee, okay.\nRamona: I know it\xe2\x80\x99s hard, but he\xe2\x80\x99s a gift to the whole world, and we can\xe2\x80\x99t be selfish.\nPenny: Yeah, he\xe2\x80\x99s a gift all right.\nRamona: Sisters?\nPenny: Um, sure, sisters. (Ramona leaves.) Holy crap on a cracker.\nScene: Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom. He is asleep. There is a tapping on the wall. He wakes up.\n  Leonard: Sheldon? (Pause, then more tapping) What are you doing?!\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s Morse code.\nLeonard: Why?\nSheldon: So we can communicate through the wall.\nLeonard: We are communicating through the wall.\nSheldon: Yes, but the communication is not encrypted.\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know Morse code.\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s very simple. This is A (knock knock) this is B (knock knock-knock-knock) this is C\xe2\x80\xa6\nLeonard: Sheldon, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to learn Morse code at three o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning!\nSheldon: All right.\nLeonard: Don\xe2\x80\x99t come in here, don\xe2\x80\x99t come in here, don\xe2\x80\x99t come in here, don\xe2\x80\x99t (Sheldon enters) Aw! What\xe2\x80\x99s going on?\nSheldon: Shh! Ramona\xe2\x80\x99s sleeping on the couch.\nLeonard: I know. When is she going home?\nSheldon: Never, that\xe2\x80\x99s the problem. I need your help.\nLeonard: What are you talking about?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m invoking the Skynet clause of our friendship agreement.\nLeonard: That only applies if you need me to help you destroy an artificial intelligence you created that\xe2\x80\x99s taking over the Earth.\nSheldon: Come on! Don\xe2\x80\x99t nitpick!\nLeonard: Good night.\nSheldon: Shh. All right, I\xe2\x80\x99m invoking our bodysnatchers clause.\nLeonard: The bodysnatchers clause requires me to help you destroy someone we know who\xe2\x80\x99s been replaced with an alien pod.\nSheldon: Yes. She\xe2\x80\x99s in the living room. Go, I\xe2\x80\x99ll wait here.\nRamona (entering): Sheldon, what are you doing out of bed?\nSheldon: Now! Do it!\nRamona: You know you need your sleep in order for your cognitive processing to perform at optimum levels. Now come on.\nSheldon: Godzilla clause?\nLeonard: Not unless she destroys Tokyo.\nSheldon: Rats.\nScene: The living room. Sheldon is surrounded by whiteboards.\n  Sheldon (excitedly): I\xe2\x80\x99ve got it! I finally reconciled the black hole information paradox with my theory of string-network condensates!\nRamona: It\xe2\x80\x99s unbelievable! It\xe2\x80\x99s paradigm-altering!\nSheldon: And I could not have done it without you.\nRamona: Oh, please, I just offered a little encouragement.\nSheldon: It was a lot more than that. You helped me work out the masses of all the fermions, and you pumiced my hammer toe. How can I ever repay you?\nRamona: Well, would you consider naming it the Cooper-Nowitzki Theorem?\nSheldon: Who\xe2\x80\x99s Nowitzki?\nRamona: I\xe2\x80\x99m Nowitzki.\nSheldon: Oh, you want me to share credit?\nRamona: Uh-huh.\nSheldon: Get out!\nScene: The hallway, Ramona is leaving.\n  Penny: Oh, hey, hi.\nRamona: Oh, bite me!\nPenny: Sisters?\nScene: The cafeteria. A red haired girl approaches the table.\n  Girl: Excuse me, Dr. Cooper, I\xe2\x80\x99m Kathy O\xe2\x80\x99Brien. I just finished reading your paper reconciling the black hole information paradox with your theory of string-network condensates, and it just took my breath away.\nSheldon: Maybe when I publish it, I\xe2\x80\x99ll include an inhaler.\nKathy: Would you possibly have any time for me to pick your brain?\nSheldon: Let\xe2\x80\x99s see, today\xe2\x80\x99s Thursday. Thursday nights, I eat pizza from Giacomo\xe2\x80\x99s. Sausage, mushrooms, light olives.\nKathy: Great. I\xe2\x80\x99ll bring it to your place. I have the address.\nSheldon: What a nice girl.\nLeonard: Sheldon, do you see what just happened here?\nSheldon: Yes, I\xe2\x80\x99m getting a free pizza. I\xe2\x80\x99m on a roll.\nScene: The living room. The guys are eating.\nSheldon: More Pad Thai, please.\nHoward: Sheldon, you\xe2\x80\x99ve already had four servings.\nRaj: You might want to slow down a bit, buddy.\nSheldon: Just one more bite.\nLeonard: Sheldon? Sheldon, are you okay?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m just so\xe2\x80\xa6 full.\n(Sheldon begins to shake uncontrollably, then expand, then a second Sheldon separates from the original Sheldon and ends up sitting next to him. Leonard wakes up in bed with a start.)\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99s it. No more Thai food.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
