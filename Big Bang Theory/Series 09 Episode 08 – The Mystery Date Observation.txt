b'After a \xe2\x80\x9cpreviously on\xe2\x80\x9d sequence.\nScene: The apartment.\nPenny: I think it\xe2\x80\x99s so adorable you\xe2\x80\x99re making Sheldon breakfast.\nLeonard: Well, he\xe2\x80\x99s having a rough time. Amy broke his heart, the DVR cut off the last minute of Doctor Who. That crow followed him home.\nPenny: Aren\xe2\x80\x99t you worried you\xe2\x80\x99re making French toast on oatmeal day?\nLeonard: Ah, well, what\xe2\x80\x99s this? A pot of oatmeal? Or, thanks to you, what I will now call gloatmeal.\nPenny: Oh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want credit for that.\nSheldon: Oh, Dr. and Mrs. Hofstadter, lovely to see you this fine morning.\nLeonard: You\xe2\x80\x99re in a good mood.\nSheldon: Yeah, I am indeed. I have decided, instead of wallowing in sadness about Amy, it is time that I find myself a new female companion.\nPenny: Oh. Good for you.\nLeonard: What brought this on?\nSheldon: I realized something. When Amy was in my life, I was hyper-focused on my work and ignored her.\nPenny: And you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to make the same mistake with the next woman.\nSheldon: No, I need a new woman in my life to ignore so I can hyper-focus on my work again.\nLeonard: Hey, I made French toast sticks.\nSheldon: On oatmeal day?\nLeonard: Ah, I also made oatmeal.\nSheldon: Ooh, that\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of carbohydrates for a man on the prowl. You know what? You eat it. You\xe2\x80\x99re married, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter what you look like.\nPenny: Don\xe2\x80\x99t take advice from a man who threw his shoe at a crow.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Thank you for coming by, gentlemen.\nHoward: No problem.\nRaj: So what\xe2\x80\x99s up?\nSheldon: Well, it was the two of you who found Amy Farrah Fowler for me. Now that I\xe2\x80\x99m looking for my next girlfriend, it seemed only logical that I employ your services once again.\nHoward: You sure you\xe2\x80\x99re up for that? She did hurt you.\nSheldon: Oh, no, it\xe2\x80\x99s all right. I think of my time with Amy as a stick of Fruit Stripe gum. Sweet and enjoyable at first, but ultimately a flavourless lump of sadness.\nRaj: You\xe2\x80\x99re not wrong about Fruit Stripe. I was always a Hubba Bubba man.\nHoward: Hubba Bubba over Dubble Bubble? You\xe2\x80\x99re crazy.\nRaj: Hey, the jaw wants what it wants.\nSheldon: Gentlemen.\nRaj: Oh, right, uh, girlfriend. Okay.\nHoward: But what are you looking for?\nSheldon: All I\xe2\x80\x99m looking for is an educated, intelligent woman who shares my interests while retaining her own unique point of view. She should be kind, patient, and most important, unable to imagine life without me by ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock tonight.\nHoward: Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that a little unreasonable?\nSheldon: All right, fine, she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t need her own point of view. Now, chop-chop.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nPenny: Come on, Amy, show us the dress.\nAmy: Okay. But I\xe2\x80\x99m really stepping outside of my comfort zone here.\nPenny: Uh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think any of your comfort zones are showing.\nBernadette: Yeah, it\xe2\x80\x99s your third date, maybe you could go more sexy.\nAmy: Well, some people think the sexiest organ is the brain.\nPenny: No one ever bought me drinks at a bar because my brain just popped out of my shirt.\nAmy: Do you have any heels higher than this? He\xe2\x80\x99s pretty tall.\nPenny: Ooh.\nBernadette: Ooh, tall. Finally some details about this mystery man.\nPenny: Yeah, come on, tell us more.\nAmy: Well, I told you his name and that he\xe2\x80\x99s tall. What more do you need?\nBernadette: Did you kiss him yet?\nAmy: Just a little peck on the lips.\nPenny: Well, we\xe2\x80\x99re your best friends, give us one more detail and we promise we\xe2\x80\x99ll leave you alone.\nAmy: Fine. Um, he\xe2\x80\x99s British. All right, that is a juicy one.\nPenny: All right, where is tall British Dave taking you?\nBernadette: Tea and basketball?\nAmy: To that new Italian place on Walnut.\nBernadette: Oh, nice.\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna go look for other shoes.\nPenny: Good luck. I threw out all my tall ones when I married Leonard.\nBernadette: Hey, you want to swing by that place tonight and get a look at this guy?\nPenny: We don\xe2\x80\x99t even know what time they\xe2\x80\x99re gonna be there.\nBernadette: I\xe2\x80\x99ll just call the restaurant, pretend I\xe2\x80\x99m Amy and check the reservation.\nPenny: Damn, you\xe2\x80\x99re sneaky.\nBernadette: Yeah, but I\xe2\x80\x99m little, so it\xe2\x80\x99s adorable.\nScene: The apartment.\nHoward: I think the quickest way to find you a new girlfriend is just to get you on every dating Web site out there.\nSheldon: Are you sure? I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard that on those sites, often when you think you\xe2\x80\x99re corresponding with someone, it\xe2\x80\x99s actually a computer program pretending to be a real person.\nRaj: And you\xe2\x80\x99re afraid it\xe2\x80\x99ll do a better job than you?\nSheldon: Excuse me. No one does a better job pretending to be a person than I do. Siri comes close, but I know more jokes.\nHoward: If you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to use dating Web sites, what do you suggest?\nSheldon: Off the top of my head? Uh, prospective women weed themselves out in a battle of wits until only one champion remains, and she shows up at my door flush with the thrill of victory, and then sits quietly by my side while I watch Daredevil.\nHoward: You seriously think women would fight for you?\nSheldon: People compete for jobs and trophies, why not me?\nHoward: He\xe2\x80\x99s right, he knows a lot of jokes.\nRaj: Yeah, no, but it is basic human nature. If we present him as a prize, maybe they would.\nHoward: Well, he\xe2\x80\x99s smart, he\xe2\x80\x99s a respected scientist.\nSheldon: And I have the soulful eyes of a cow.\nRaj: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if I\xe2\x80\x99d say you\xe2\x80\xa6 oh.\nHoward: I have an idea. What if we put a post on Craigslist that says world-class Caltech physicist seeking girlfriend. If interested, solve the following puzzles for a chance to meet him.\nSheldon: Oh, we\xe2\x80\x99ll make the puzzles extremely challenging to eliminate unworthy candidates.\nRaj: Oh, we could set it up like a scavenger hunt where the last puzzle gives the winner Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s contact information.\nHoward: Well, this is actually an interesting social experiment.\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99m a little jealous of the people who get to do it.\nHoward: Me, too. And we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the prize.\nScene: The stairwell.\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand why we\xe2\x80\x99re leaving so early for the movie.\nPenny: Oh, I forgot to tell you, we\xe2\x80\x99re gonna meet up with Bernadette to spy on Amy and her date.\nLeonard: What? I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to do that.\nPenny: What, and you think I want to see a documentary about aluminium can recycling?\nLeonard: This is the movie that big soda doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want you to see.\nPenny: No, it\xe2\x80\x99s the movie your wife doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want you to see.\nLeonard: So you\xe2\x80\x99re actually okay with invading your friend\xe2\x80\x99s privacy?\nPenny: You\xe2\x80\x99re not curious who she\xe2\x80\x99s out with?\nLeonard: Not really.\nPenny: But you\xe2\x80\x99re curious about aluminium cans? You\xe2\x80\x99re a weird little guy.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s it. The Sheldon Cooper Girlfriend Challenge is officially live.\nHoward: Congratulations.\nRaj: This is exciting.\nSheldon: Right now, somewhere, a woman is dividing the atomic weight of the best noble gas by the number of colours in the oldest national flag still in use.\nHoward: Then using that number as the average speed to calculate the travel time from Mordor to the Shire.\nSheldon: And, taking her first step towards a lifetime of laughter, love and, best of all, rules.\nRaj: I, I hope we didn\xe2\x80\x99t make the puzzles too hard.\nHoward: Well, if she can solve them, it\xe2\x80\x99ll prove she\xe2\x80\x99s intelligent, tenacious and so socially awkward she has nothing better to do on a Saturday night.\nSheldon: Golly, she sounds too good to be true.\nScene: A restaurant.\nTall British Dave: This is fun. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t dated much since my divorce.\nAmy: Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m having a good time, too. If you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind me asking, why did you and your wife split up?\nDave: Oh, you know how it is, we wanted different things. I wanted children, and she wanted a pastry chef named Jean-Philippe.\nAmy: Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m, I\xe2\x80\x99m so sorry.\nDave: No, it\xe2\x80\x99s, it\xe2\x80\x99s fine. It\xe2\x80\x99s why I left England. It reminded me too much of her. Cold, gloomy and easily accessed by a Frenchman through a tunnel.\n(in the car outside)\nPenny: Hey. So, where are they?\nBernadette: Across the street, in the left window.\nPenny: Oh, damn it, we should have brought binoculars.\nBernadette: Right here.\nLeonard: You just happen to have those in the car?\nBernadette: Kinda. Before I met Howie, I liked to keep close tabs on my boyfriends.\nLeonard: By stalking them?\nBernadette: No. Stalkers are creepy. I\xe2\x80\x99m just a harmless little girl with military-grade spy equipment.\nPenny: Oh, there he is.\nBernadette: He\xe2\x80\x99s cute, right?\nPenny: Yeah.\nLeonard: Can I see?\nPenny: What, now you\xe2\x80\x99re interested? You didn\xe2\x80\x99t even want to come.\nLeonard: I know, but you guys make being a crappy friend look fun.\nPenny: Fine.\nLeonard: Yeah, okay, I see him. It looks like they\xe2\x80\x99re having a nice time. I wish I could hear what they\xe2\x80\x99re saying.\nBernadette: Yeah, I should\xe2\x80\x99ve brought my parabolic microphone.\nPenny: Your what?\nBernadette: Nothing. Not important.\nDave: So you\xe2\x80\x99ve never been married?\nAmy: No. I mean, to be completely honest, I\xe2\x80\x99ve, I\xe2\x80\x99ve only been in one long-term relationship.\nDave: Oh. What happened with that?\nAmy: That\xe2\x80\x99s a good question. After five years, it was just feeling like more work than it should be.\nDave: Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s too bad. Was he a neurobiologist like you?\nAmy: No. He\xe2\x80\x99s a theoretical physicist at Caltech.\nDave: I love teaching math, but that would be my dream job. What\xe2\x80\x99s his focus?\nAmy: Um, used to be string theory, now it\xe2\x80\x99s dark matter. But let\xe2\x80\x99s not discuss Sheldon. Let\xe2\x80\x99s get back to you.\nDave: Wait, you\xe2\x80\x99re not talking about Dr. Sheldon Cooper?\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99m trying not to. Do you know him?\nDave: No, but I\xe2\x80\x99ve followed his work for years. He\xe2\x80\x99s a rock star. You\xe2\x80\x99ve got to tell me about him. What\xe2\x80\x99s he like?\nPenny: He really seems into her.\nBernadette: I took a video. I forgot how much fun this is.\nLeonard: Okay, we saw them. Can we go catch the movie?\nBernadette: Why\xe2\x80\x99d you bring him?\nPenny: I had to; we\xe2\x80\x99re married now.\nBernadette: Ugh, I hear that.\nDave: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, just one more question about Sheldon.\nAmy: Sure, why not?\nDave: It\xe2\x80\x99s more of a four-part question, really. When he wrote his paper on supersingular prime numbers, how long did it take?\nAmy: Um about an hour and half.\nDave: Wow. I mean, wow. And you were there to see it?\nAmy: Yes. Yep. We were on a date. Very much like this one.\nDave: Mm. I doubt it was like this one. I mean, he\xe2\x80\x99s a genius, and I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t even smart enough to figure out why my wife always smelled of croissants.\nAmy: What was the rest of your question?\nDave: Do you think you could introduce me to him?\nAmy: Really? You-you want me to introduce you to my ex-boyfriend?\nDave: You\xe2\x80\x99re right, it\xe2\x80\x99s, it\xe2\x80\x99s weird. No, wait. Do it. No. I changed my mind. I\xe2\x80\x99d be too nervous. Oh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to do.\nLeonard: Are we gonna be much longer? I really have to go to the bathroom.\nBernadette: Right here.\nScene: The apartment.\nRaj: 37 minutes left until the deadline.\nSheldon: Someone will show.\nHoward: And no matter what happens, this is still a fun experiment.\nRaj: Not as fun as the night we blew up grapes in the microwave. We really have led full lives.\nSheldon: Someone will show.\nRaj: Maybe you don\xe2\x80\x99t want someone exactly like you. You know what they say, opposites attract.\nSheldon: Well, by that logic, I should be with someone short, dull and needy, eh? Not to cast aspersions, but I can\xe2\x80\x99t shake a stick around here without hitting that.\nScene: The restaurant.\nDave: You know, I once drove 500 miles to hear him speak at Stanford.\nAmy: I have a DVD of that lecture.\nDave: Really? Wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it great?\nAmy: Not as a Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s present, no.\nDave: Well, the next time you watch it, I\xe2\x80\x99m the bloke who asked the question that he said was stupid and obvious. It was the nicest thing he said to anyone there.\nAmy: That\xe2\x80\x99s, um, terrific. Listen, I\xe2\x80\x99m, I\xe2\x80\x99m kind of tired. Can we call it a night?\nDave: Oh, gosh. Sorry, I\xe2\x80\x99ve just spent the whole night talking about your ex-boyfriend. I\xe2\x80\x99m such an idiot.\nAmy: No, you\xe2\x80\x99re not.\nDave: Well, maybe not an idiot, but certainly not as smart as someone we won\xe2\x80\x99t mention.\nAmy: Thank you.\nDave: That you said you might introduce me to, I\xe2\x80\x99m free on Thursday.\nBernadette: Hey, hey, they\xe2\x80\x99re leaving.\nPenny: What? Here, give me, give me. Oh, my God. Oh, my God, they\xe2\x80\x99re coming right towards us.\nBernadette: We got to get out of here.\nPenny: Okay. Well, wait, what about Leonard?\nBernadette: He and his tiny bladder can take the bus. (Reverses into car behind)\nPenny: Oh, no.\nDave: She just hit my car.\nAmy: What are you guys doing here?\nBernadette: Hi, Ames, what are you doing here?\nLeonard: What happened?\nDave: O-M-G. Aren\xe2\x80\x99t you Leonard Hofstadter?\nLeonard: Yeah.\nDave: I saw you speak at Stanford with Sheldon Cooper. Amy, can you believe it? It\xe2\x80\x99s Dr. Leonard Hofstadter.\nAmy: No. Pinch me.\nDave: It\xe2\x80\x99s an absolute pleasure to meet you. Can I shake your hand?\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if you want to do that, I was just, okay, never mind.\nDave: Amy, I\xe2\x80\x99m never washing this hand again.\nLeonard: You really should.\nScene: The apartment.\nRaj: Sixty seconds. This is not looking good.\nSheldon: One minute is a long time.\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99ve been telling women that for 20 years.\nRaj: Forty-five.\nSheldon: 45 seconds is plenty of time for a woman to walk through that door and fall in love with me. You know, probably half that if I break out the old cow eyes.\nRaj: Thirty seconds.\nSheldon: Uh-oh. What if it\xe2\x80\x99s Jennifer Lawrence?\nHoward: What?\nSheldon: Well, that last Hunger Games was not my cup of tea.\nHoward: You thought she was great in X-Men.\nSheldon: Oh, fine, I won\xe2\x80\x99t shut my heart to the love of Jennifer Lawrence.\nRaj: Guys, fifteen seconds.\nHoward: Maybe she\xe2\x80\x99s waiting to show up at the last possible moment.\nSheldon: Sounds like a drama queen. Oh, no. It is Jennifer Lawrence.\nRaj: Five, four, three, two, one. That\xe2\x80\x99s too bad.\nHoward: Maybe we did make the test too difficult.\nRaj: I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it matters. Look, Sheldon, I believe when the time is right for you to meet someone, it\xe2\x80\x99ll just happen. Okay? Not because of a test or a Web site, but because\xe2\x80\xa6 (knock on door) we are the dreamers of dreams.\nHoward: It\xe2\x80\x99s an actual girl, and she\xe2\x80\x99s really pretty.\nRaj: Answer it.\nSheldon: All right. Can I help you?\nGirl: Um, are you the physicist that placed the ad on Craigslist?\nSheldon: Yes.\nGirl: Hi. I\xe2\x80\x99m Vanessa Bennett. Sorry it took a while for me to get here. I was stuck in this boring symposium on atomic spectroscopy when I came across your ad, and it saved my night. The puzzles were, were really fun. I\xe2\x80\x99ve never had to translate Klingon into ancient Sanskrit before.\nSheldon: Careful, it\xe2\x80\x99s addictive.\nVanessa: Chija\xe2\x80\x9de\xe2\x80\x99vlKub je. Or, as they say in Sanskrit, Ahm asman matey-bee ta-teyva.\nSheldon: And just like that, you\xe2\x80\x99re a Klingon-Sanskrit junkie.\nVanessa: Anyway, I, I just, I knew I had to meet the person responsible for such a brilliant idea. And I don\xe2\x80\x99t need to tell you, there aren\xe2\x80\x99t a lot of men who love physics, archaic languages and flags of the world.\nSheldon: I am a bit of a unicorn. Well, you certainly seem like a special lady, uh, but as you know, you missed the deadline, so thanks for playing.\nRaj: How could you send her away?\nSheldon: She was late. And she found atomic spectroscopy boring. Well, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t coitus her with your genitals.\nScene: Amy\xe2\x80\x99s car.\nDave: Uh, thanks for driving me home.\nAmy: No problem. I\xe2\x80\x99m really sorry about your car.\nDave: Oh, it\xe2\x80\x99s all right. If you\xe2\x80\x99re free next weekend, I\xe2\x80\x99d love to take you out again.\nAmy: Um, listen, you\xe2\x80\x99re a really nice guy, but I just, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think this is working out.\nDave: Oh. Okay.\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99m, I\xe2\x80\x99m really sorry.\nDave: No, it\xe2\x80\x99s, at least the same woman that rejected Sheldon Cooper rejected me.\nAmy: There you go.\nDave: If I ever do meet him, we\xe2\x80\x99ll have that in common.\nAmy: Sure. Heh.\nDave: And, he\xe2\x80\x99s kissed you and I\xe2\x80\x99ve kissed you, so if you think about it\xe2\x80\xa6\nAmy: Okay, get out.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
