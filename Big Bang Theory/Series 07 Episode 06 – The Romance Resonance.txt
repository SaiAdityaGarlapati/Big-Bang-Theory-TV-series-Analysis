b'Scene: The Cheesecake Factory\nPenny: What are you working on?\nSheldon: Can\xe2\x80\x99t talk. In the zone.\nPenny: Do you know what he\xe2\x80\x99s doing?\nAmy: Could be anything. Last time he was like this, he figured out electron transport in graphene. The time before that, he was making a list of who\xe2\x80\x99s allowed in his tree fort if fe ever gets one. Still can\xe2\x80\x99t believe I didn\xe2\x80\x99t make the cut.\nPenny: Uh, Sheldon, you want to take a break? Your food\xe2\x80\x99s ready.\nLeonard: No, no, what are you doing? He\xe2\x80\x99s both happy and quiet. It\xe2\x80\x99s like seeing a unicorn and Bigfoot at the same time.\nHoward: Sorry we\xe2\x80\x99re so late. Bernadette got stuck at work.\nBernadette: Great news. A raccoon virus just crossed the species barrier and now can infect humans.\nRaj: Why is that great news?\nBernadette: In the pharmaceutical business we have a saying, mo\xe2\x80\x99 infections, mo\xe2\x80\x99 money.\nHoward: Wait, Maybe you want to wash your little raccoon hands first.\nBernadette: Oh, calm down. If I had it, I\xe2\x80\x99d be dead already.\nHoward: Guys, listen up.\nSheldon: Can\xe2\x80\x99t listen, zone. Also don\xe2\x80\x99t care.\nHoward: Next week is the anniversary of my first date with Bernadette.\nSheldon: Really don\xe2\x80\x99t care.\nHoward: I want to do something special, and I was hoping you guys could be a part of it.\nPenny: Aw, what horrible thing are you trying to make up for?\nHoward: Just putting something in the bank for what horrible thing I do next.\nPenny: Ah.\nHoward: Look, she\xe2\x80\x99s gonna be back any second, so here\xe2\x80\x99s the deal. I\xe2\x80\x99m writing a song, and I was hoping we could all play it for her together.\nLeonard: Aw.\nAmy: Oh, I love that.\nRaj: That is so beautiful.\nHoward: Sheldon?\nSheldon: When did we get to the Cheesecake Factory?\nCredits sequence\nScene: The stairwell\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s really sweet what Howard wants to do for Bernadette.\nPenny: Yeah. Hey, how come you\xe2\x80\x99ve never done anything romantic to celebrate our first date?\nLeonard: Well, for starters, you\xe2\x80\x99ve broken up with me so many times, which first date are we talking about?\nSheldon: Ooh, somebody call the burn ward. And back to the zone.\nLeonard: And besides, I do romantic things for you all the time. Can you even name one romantic thing you\xe2\x80\x99ve done for me?\nPenny: I can name tons.\nLeonard: Sex doesn\xe2\x80\x99t count.\nPenny: Oh. I know, what about that bed-and-breakfast?\nLeonard: Well, I took you there. All you did was\xe2\x80\xa6\nPenny: I know what I did. I bet they had to throw out that rocking chair. You know, I can be romantic if I want to.\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s fine. And also not true.\nPenny: Okay, just you wait and see. I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna romance your freakin\xe2\x80\x99 ass off.\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99s beautiful. Is that Shakespeare?\nPenny: Sheldon?\nSheldon: Zone.\nLeonard: He\xe2\x80\x99ll figure it out when he falls off the roof.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: Sheldon, I know you\xe2\x80\x99re in the zone, but do you want some tea? All right, I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna say this, but you haven\xe2\x80\x99t spoken in hours and I\xe2\x80\x99m starting to get worried. Please say something.\nSheldon: Leonard, prepare to be humbled and weep at the glory of my genius.\nLeonard: Nope, it was better before.\nSheldon: Look at it. I feel like my mind just made a baby. And it\xe2\x80\x99s beautiful. It\xe2\x80\x99s not like human babies, which are loud and covered in goop.\nLeonard: Holy crap, Sheldon, did you just figure out a method for synthesizing a new stable super-heavy element?\nSheldon: Did I? Well, that can\xe2\x80\x99t be right. No one\xe2\x80\x99s ever done that before. Except me, because I just did it. Sheldon and his brain, yeah. Sheldon and his brain, yeah. Sheldon and his brain, yeah. Sheldon and his brain, yeah. Sheldon and his brain\xe2\x80\xa6\nLeonard: Yeah, definitely better before.\nScene: The cafeteria.\nHoward: So I\xe2\x80\x99m almost done writing the song for Bernadette. Are you cool playing the cello?\nLeonard: If by cool you mean willing to, yes. If by cool you mean cool, clearly you\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen me play the cello.\nHoward: Great. Will you play the ukulele?\nRaj: Of course. I\xe2\x80\x99d be happy to shred it on my ax.\nHoward: Or you could just play your tiny, ridiculous guitar.\nRaj: Fine. I will melt her heart. And her face.\nSheldon: Gentlemen. Uh, no doubt you heard about my little breakthrough. Now, if your plan is to hoist me on your shoulders and carry me around the cafeteria, please refrain. I don\xe2\x80\x99t care for heights, motion sickness or the thought of your necks touching my buttocks.\nHoward: Seriously, congratulations, Sheldon.\nRaj: Yeah, I read your paper online. That technique for creating a new heavy element is inspired.\nSheldon: Oh, well, thank you. Believe it or not, I just learned a Chinese research team at the Hubei Institute for Nuclear Physics ran a test on a cyclotron, and the results were extremely promising.\nLeonard: Sheldon, that\xe2\x80\x99s incredible.\nSheldon: Yeah, I know. They called it the greatest thing since the Communist party. Although I\xe2\x80\x99m pretty sure that the Communist party made them say that. I like China. See, they know how to keep people in line.\nHoward: So, what happens next?\nSheldon: Oh, more testing, more success, more fame. Yeah, but don\xe2\x80\x99t worry, I will remain the same down-to-earth humble Joe I\xe2\x80\x99ve always been.\nLeonard: Good to know.\nSheldon: Now give me that cookie, I discovered an element.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nPenny: Thank you so much for coming.\nRaj: You called the right person. I believe I have the perfect romantic evening for you to give Leonard.\nPenny: Okay, good, \xe2\x80\x99cause I\xe2\x80\x99ve been really struggling with this.\nRaj: As I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you\xe2\x80\x99re aware, the quickest way to a man\xe2\x80\x99s heart is through his\xe2\x80\xa6\nPenny: Pants, but Leonard says sex doesn\xe2\x80\x99t count.\nRaj: Oh. You poor thing. You have one arrow in your quiver, and you just can\xe2\x80\x99t use it. Fortunately, another pathway to a man\xe2\x80\x99s heart is through his stomach.\nPenny: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if I want to cook for him. He\xe2\x80\x99s kind of a picky eater. I mean, it\xe2\x80\x99s too salty, it\xe2\x80\x99s too dry, it\xe2\x80\x99s too burnt and frozen at the same time. Okay, come on, what else would sweep you off your feet?\nRaj: Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ve always had this fantasy that involves dancing. The sexual chemistry between my partner and me is electric. But boy, oh, boy, does my father not approve until he sees us in the big dance competition.\nPenny: Okay, that\xe2\x80\x99s just the plot for Dirty Dancing. What else would you love? Other than being lifted over Patrick Swayze\xe2\x80\x99s head.\nRaj: Oh, oh, uh, you could, uh, stand outside his window with a boom box in the air.\nPenny: That\xe2\x80\x99s from Say Anything.\nRaj: Look, I\xe2\x80\x99m a lonely guy, I watch a lot of movies. Look, Penny, if you truly want to be romantic, it needs to come from you.\nPenny: I get that, but why is this so hard?\nRaj: Well, you\xe2\x80\x99ve probably never had to do this stuff \xe2\x80\x99cause you\xe2\x80\x99re young and beautiful and men have always thrown themselves at you.\nPenny: Yeah, I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to be sad about that. I can\xe2\x80\x99t.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Let\xe2\x80\x99s see, what\xe2\x80\x99s next? Okay, here. This is the Magic Marker I was using when I made the discovery.\nAmy: I don\xe2\x80\x99t think the Smithsonian\xe2\x80\x99s gonna want your marker.\nSheldon: And that\xe2\x80\x99s why you\xe2\x80\x99re not on a list for my tree fort. Ooh, guess who\xe2\x80\x99s getting an article written about him in Physics Today? I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you a hint. You measured the diameter of his suspicious mole yesterday.\nAmy: Sheldon, I\xe2\x80\x99m so proud of you.\nSheldon: Well, you should be. My discovery is spreading like wildfire. Unlike my mole, which is holding steady at the size of a navy bean.\nAmy: What\xe2\x80\x99s next?\nSheldon: This is the very copy of The Handbook of Chemistry and Physics in which I looked up the reaction rates of mendelevium and\xe2\x80\xa6\nAmy: And what?\nSheldon: No. No, no, no, no.\nAmy: What\xe2\x80\x99s wrong?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99ve made a horrible mistake.\nAmy: What are you talking about?\nSheldon: This table, it\xe2\x80\x99s in square centimetres. I read it as square metres. You know what that means?\nAmy: That Americans can\xe2\x80\x99t handle the metric system?\nSheldon: Amy, I was off by a factor of 10,000.\nAmy: But the Chinese team found the element.\nSheldon: Yeah, well, they shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have. My calculations were wrong. There must be some resonance between the elements I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know about.\nAmy: So you just got lucky?\nSheldon: Sheldon Cooper does not get lucky.\nAmy: You and me both, brother. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter. The element was found because of you, and that\xe2\x80\x99s groundbreaking.\nSheldon: What matters is the greatest scientific achievement of my life is based on a blunder. I\xe2\x80\x99m not a genius, I\xe2\x80\x99m a fraud.\nAmy: You know, Sheldon, in neuroscience, we\xe2\x80\x99re forever finding something in one part of the brain that we thought was someplace else.\nSheldon: Oh, great. Now I\xe2\x80\x99m worse than a fraud. I\xe2\x80\x99m practically a biologist.\nScene: Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s car.\nLeonard:: You got to stop beating yourself up over this. I mean, you made a mistake, but it was a happy mistake.\nSheldon: There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing happy about it. I\xe2\x80\x99m being given credit that I don\xe2\x80\x99t deserve.\nLeonard: Oh, people get things they don\xe2\x80\x99t deserve all the time. Look at me with you.\nSheldon: No, Leonard, this is going to haunt me for the rest of my life. Every science classroom, every periodic table, every textbook, this mistake will be staring back at me. Like that time you let Koothrappali wax your eyebrows. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to find a way to stop this thing.\nLeonard: Buddy, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you can. I mean, once it\xe2\x80\x99s out there, it\xe2\x80\x99s out there. This thing is like the science equivalent of a sex tape.\nSheldon: You know, frankly, I\xe2\x80\x99d prefer a sex tape.\nLeonard: You don\xe2\x80\x99t know what a sex tape is, do you?\nSheldon: No.\nScene: The cafeteria.\nHoward: Make sure you guys get to the restaurant by eight. Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s meeting me there at eight thirty and I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to blow the surprise.\nLeonard: We\xe2\x80\x99ll be there.\nRaj: Got it. Now, uh, I have a question about the song. I was thinking at some point I could bust out a little rap.\nHoward: E-Ni-Ni-Ni-Ni-No.\nRaj: Come on, come on, you haven\xe2\x80\x99t even heard it yet. Leonard, give me a beat.\nLeonard: I will not.\nRaj: Oh, please?\nHoward: No, I want this to be romantic.\nRaj: It will be. I don\xe2\x80\x99t call anyone a ho, and the only time I use the phrase my bitch, I\xe2\x80\x99m referring to you.\nVoice: There he is. (General applause)\nSheldon: Stop it. Stop celebrating me.\nVoice: Woo!\nSheldon: And no woos. Oh, not you, Dr. Woo. You\xe2\x80\x99re fine. I want you all to know that you have no reason to applaud me. My so-called breakthrough wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the result of my genius. It was nothing more than a boneheaded mistake. So please refrain from praising me for it in the future.\nRaj: Wait, I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand. They didn\xe2\x80\x99t find the element?\nSheldon: Oh, no, they found the element. (More applause) No, no, stop it. I don\xe2\x80\x99t need to take this admiration from the likes of you people. How do I make them stop loving me?\nLeonard: Invite them to live with us.\nScene: A restaurant.\nPenny: Boy, Bernadette is gonna love this.\nLeonard: Yeah. It must be nice to have someone do something so romantic.\nPenny: Okay, you know what\xe2\x80\x99s not romantic? Rubbing it in someone\xe2\x80\x99s face.\nLeonard: Actually, it can be, but I told you sex doesn\xe2\x80\x99t count.\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m getting worried about Bernadette. I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna call and check on her.\nSheldon: The National Science Foundation wants to give me a substantial grant.\nRaj: Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s a big deal.\nSheldon: I know. When will this nightmare end?\nLeonard: Hey, I get that you feel bad about all the attention, but still, what you did is amazing. We\xe2\x80\x99re really proud of you.\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99m not.\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re not?\nAmy: Sheldon, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been thinking about it, and you\xe2\x80\x99re right. You don\xe2\x80\x99t deserve any credit. All you did was misread some numbers on a table. A very easy table, too. Honestly, I\xe2\x80\x99m embarrassed for you.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s the most romantic thing I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever heard.\nPenny: Damn it, everyone\xe2\x80\x99s better at this than me.\nSheldon: Congratulations, Dr. Fowler. You just made the fort.\nHoward: Guys, there was an accident at Bernie\xe2\x80\x99s lab.\nLeonard: Oh, my God, is she okay?\nHoward: Yeah, but she\xe2\x80\x99s at the hospital in quarantine.\nPenny: What?\nAmy: Poor Bernadette.\nLeonard: Oh, no.\nSheldon: I hate to pile on the bad news, but I just got a raise.\nScene: The hospital.\nHoward: Oh, my God, Bernie, what happened?\nBernadette: Well, let\xe2\x80\x99s just say the next time you move a dozen vials of raccoon virus to the fridge, make two trips.\nHoward: You\xe2\x80\x99re sure you\xe2\x80\x99re okay?\nBernadette: Yeah, it\xe2\x80\x99s just a precaution. If there was a problem, I\xe2\x80\x99d be throwing up out of my eyeballs by now. Sorry I messed up our date.\nHoward: Oh, don\xe2\x80\x99t worry about it. I brought the date here. Guys, come on in.\nBernadette: What\xe2\x80\x99s all this?\nHoward: Well, tonight is the anniversary of our first date, and I wanted to celebrate it by writing a song for you.\nBernadette: Howie.\nAmy: Sheldon, get over here.\nSheldon: She might be contagious. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you think I\xe2\x80\x99m having a rough enough day?\nAmy: Sheldon.\nHoward (singing): If I didn\xe2\x80\x99t have you, life would be blue, I\xe2\x80\x99d be Dr. Who without the TARDIS.\nSheldon: Is it me, or does she not look so good?\nAmy: Shh.\nHoward: A candle without a wick, a Watson without a Crick, I\xe2\x80\x99d be one of my outfits without a dick-ie. I\xe2\x80\x99d be cheese without the mac, Jobs without the Wozniak, I\xe2\x80\x99d be solving exponential equations that use bases not found on your calculator making it much harder to crack. I\xe2\x80\x99d be an atom without a bomb, a dot without the com, and I\xe2\x80\x99d probably still live with my mom.\nAll: And he\xe2\x80\x99d probably still live with his mom.\nHoward: Ever since I met you, you turned my world around. You supported all my dreams and all my hopes. You\xe2\x80\x99re like uranium-235 and I\xe2\x80\x99m uranium-238, almost inseparable isotopes. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have imagined how good my life would get from the moment that I met you Bernadette.\nBernadette: Oh, Howie.\nHoward: If I didn\xe2\x80\x99t have you life would be dreary, I\xe2\x80\x99d be string theory without any string. I\xe2\x80\x99d be binary code without a one, a cathode ray tube without an electron gun. I\xe2\x80\x99d be Firefly, Buffy and Avengers without Joss Whedon. I\xe2\x80\x99d speak a lot more Klingon, Heghlu\xe2\x80\x99meH QaQ jajvam.\nAll: And he\xe2\x80\x99d definitely still live with his mom.\nHoward: Ever since I met you, you turned my world around. You\xe2\x80\x99re my best friend and my lover. We\xe2\x80\x99re like changing electric and magnetic fields. You can\xe2\x80\x99t have one without the other. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have imagined how good my life would get from the moment that I met you, Bernadette.\nAll: Oh, we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have imagined how good our lives would get from the moment that we met you, Bernadette.\nBernadette: Howie, that was amazing. Look, I\xe2\x80\x99m shaking.\nSheldon: She\xe2\x80\x99s sick, I knew it. Bye.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nLeonard: I have to say, this is the best Top Ramen you\xe2\x80\x99ve ever made.\nPenny: I discovered a secret ingredient. The flavour packet. That sucker is well named. All right, lover boy, get ready, \xe2\x80\x99cause there is a crap storm of romance coming your way.\nLeonard: Stop it, you\xe2\x80\x99re gonna make me cry. All right. You seem pretty confident.\nPenny: Oh, I am. Maybe if you follow this trail, you\xe2\x80\x99ll see why.\nLeonard: Oh, rose petals.\nPenny: Yes. The most beautiful and shockingly expensive of all the flowers.\nLeonard: You made the bed? You really are pulling out all the stops.\nPenny: Okay, I gave this a lot of thought, and I finally found something to show you how much I love you.\nLeonard: Oh, wow.\nPenny: It\xe2\x80\x99s a first edition of Hitchhiker\xe2\x80\x99s Guide to the Galaxy. I remember it was your favourite book growing up.\nLeonard: This is great. It, thank you, it\xe2\x80\x99s, so much.\nPenny: What?\nLeonard: Nothing. I love it.\nPenny: No. Something\xe2\x80\x99s going on. What\xe2\x80\x99s wrong with it? I remember you saying how great it would be to have a first edition.\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s true, I did. I did say that. When we were at the used bookstore together and I saw the first edition and I bought it.\nPenny: Oh, my God, I am the worst.\nLeonard: No, no, it\xe2\x80\x99s okay. It\xe2\x80\x99s really thoughtful.\nPenny: No, it\xe2\x80\x99s not. I mean, what\xe2\x80\x99s thoughtful is everything you do. Here, you know what? Look at this. Look, here\xe2\x80\x99s the, the plane ticket you bought me when I was too poor to go home for the holidays. And the rose you left on my windshield just because. Here\xe2\x80\x99s the, the thank-you letter you wrote me after the first time I slept with you. All 11 pages of it.\nLeonard: I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe you saved all this stuff.\nPenny: Of course I did. It\xe2\x80\x99s you.\nLeonard: Come here.\nPenny: Oh.\nLeonard: Is that a pregnancy test?\nPenny: Oh, yeah, just the first one. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t save them all.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe I read this table wrong. I blame you.\nAmy: Me? What did I do?\nSheldon: You distract me. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been distracted since the moment I met you.\nAmy: Sorry.\nSheldon: Well, you should be. Because all I can think about is how much I want to kiss you. And not just on the cheek, but on the mouth. Like mommies and daddies do.\nAmy: Oh, Sheldon.\nSheldon (not in Amy\xe2\x80\x99s daydream, now in the Cheesecake Factory): Amy? Amy? Did you hear what I said?\nAmy: Can\xe2\x80\x99t talk, in the zone.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
