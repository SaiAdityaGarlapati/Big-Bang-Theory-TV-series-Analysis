b'Scene: The apartment. The guys are studying a complex chart on the whiteboard.\nLeonard: Hmmm.\nSheldon: The problem appears to be unsolvable.\nRaj: Maybe you could run some computer simulations.\nHoward: There are too many variables. It would take forever.\nLeonard: We\xe2\x80\x99ve got to be missing something. Let\xe2\x80\x99s start again. The movie is playing here at 7:20, here at 7:40, here at 8:10 and here at 8:45.\nSheldon: Right, these theatres have to be eliminated.\nLeonard: Why? They\xe2\x80\x99re state-of-the-art digital projection, 20-channel surround sound.\nSheldon: Yes, but they have no Icee machines. Despite my aggressive letter-writing campaign, I might add.\nRaj: What about the multiplex here? The seats are terrific.\nSheldon: They have Twizzlers instead of Red Vines. No amount of lumbar support can compensate for that.\nLeonard: Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s gonna take at least an hour to eat, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t see a Sheldon-approved restaurant proximate to a Sheldon-approved theatre.\nRaj: We could eat after the movie.\nSheldon: Unacceptable, the delay would result in tomorrow morning\xe2\x80\x99s bowel movement occurring at work.\nRaj: Hang on, hang on. There\xe2\x80\x99s a 7-Eleven here. We smuggle Slurpies, which are essentially Icees, in under our coats, after having a pleasant meal either here, here or here.\nHoward: Wow. I don\xe2\x80\x99t see how we missed that.\nSheldon: Excuse me, in what universe are Slurpies Icees?\nRaj: That\xe2\x80\x99s how we missed it.\nLeonard: Sheldon, would you be prepared, on a non-precedential basis, to create an emergency ad-hoc Slurpie-Icee equivalency?\nSheldon: Oh, Leonard, you know I can\xe2\x80\x99t do that.\nHoward: Okay, I guess we only have one option.\nRaj: Yep, I don\xe2\x80\x99t see any way around it.\nLeonard: Bye, Sheldon.\nHoward: See ya.\nRaj: Later, dude.\nSheldon: They\xe2\x80\x99re right, it was the only option.\nCredits sequence.\n  Scene: The hallway. Sheldon is opening the apartment door. Penny comes running up stairs.\nPenny: Ooh, ooh, shut the door, shut the door.\nSheldon: Why?\nPenny: Just do it! (Penny runs in. Sheldon shuts door. Penny opens door again) Get inside and shut the door.\nSheldon: Well, you didn\xe2\x80\x99t specify.\nPenny: Is Leonard around?\nSheldon: He went to the movies without me. It was the only option. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand which social situation this is. Could you give me some guidance as to how to proceed?\nPenny: The building manager\xe2\x80\x99s showing an apartment downstairs, and I haven\xe2\x80\x99t paid my rent.\nSheldon: Oh, I see. Penny, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure I\xe2\x80\x99m comfortable harbouring a fugitive from the 2311 North Los Robles Corporation.\nPenny: It\xe2\x80\x99s no big deal. I\xe2\x80\x99m just a little behind on my bills because they cut back my hours at the restaurant and my car broke down.\nSheldon: If you recall, I pointed out the \xe2\x80\x9ccheck engine\xe2\x80\x9d light to you several months ago.\nPenny: Well the \xe2\x80\x9ccheck engine\xe2\x80\x9d light is fine. It\xe2\x80\x99s still blinking away. It\xe2\x80\x99s the stupid engine that stopped working. It cost me like twelve hundred dollars to fix it.\nSheldon: You know, it occurs to me you could solve all your problems by obtaining more money.\nPenny: Yes, it occurs to me, too.\nSheldon: Hang on a moment. (He opens a jar. Snakes jump out. He then pulls out a large wedge of money) Here. Take some. Pay me back when you can.\nPenny: Wow, you got a lot of money in there.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s why it\xe2\x80\x99s guarded by snakes. Take some.\nPenny: Don\xe2\x80\x99t be silly.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m never silly. Here.\nPenny: No, I can\xe2\x80\x99t.\nSheldon: Don\xe2\x80\x99t you need money?\nPenny: Well, yeah, but\xe2\x80\xa6\nSheldon: This is money I\xe2\x80\x99m not using.\nPenny: But what if you need it?\nSheldon: My expenses account for 46.9% of my after-tax income. The rest is divvied up between a small savings account, this deceptive container of peanut brittle and the hollowed-out buttocks of a superhero action figure who shall remain nameless for his own protection. Or her own protection. Take some.\nPenny: Really? I mean, are you sure?\nSheldon: I see no large upcoming expenditures unless they develop an affordable technology to fuse my skeleton with adamantium like Wolverine.\nPenny: Are they working on that?\nSheldon: I sincerely hope so.\nPenny: Okay. Well, thank you. Oh, God, no, I can\xe2\x80\x99t. Sheldon honey, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want things to be weird between us.\nSheldon: Won\xe2\x80\x99t it also be weird if I have to say hello to you every morning on my way to work and you\xe2\x80\x99re living in a refrigerator box and washing your hair with rain water?\nPenny: I\xe2\x80\x99ll pay you back as soon as I can.\nSheldon: Of course you will. It\xe2\x80\x99s impossible to pay me back sooner than you can. Assuming you subscribe to a linear understanding of time and causality.\nPenny: I\xe2\x80\x99m regretting this already.\nScene: Entering the lobby of the building.\nSheldon: You know, I\xe2\x80\x99ve given the matter some thought, and I think I\xe2\x80\x99d be willing to be a house pet to a race of super-intelligent aliens.\nLeonard: Interesting.\nSheldon: Ask me why.\nLeonard: Do I have to?\nSheldon: Of course. That\xe2\x80\x99s how you move a conversation forward.\nLeonard: Why?\nSheldon: The learning opportunities would be abundant. Additionally, I like having my belly scratched.\nLeonard: Hey, Penny. How was work?\nPenny: Great. I hope I\xe2\x80\x99m a waitress at the Cheesecake Factory for my whole life.\nSheldon: Was that sarcasm?\nPenny: No.\nSheldon: Was that sarcasm?\nPenny: Yes.\nSheldon: Was that sarca..\nLeonard: Stop it!\nSheldon: Penny, you appear to have a package here.\nPenny: Oh, thanks. This must be the beret I ordered. A couple of months ago. It was back-ordered.\nSheldon: Did you know the beret is an example of piece of women\xe2\x80\x99s fashion adapted from male military uniforms? Another fascinating example is the epaulet.\nLeonard: He\xe2\x80\x99s not lying, he does find that fascinating.\nPenny: Okay, whatever. It\xe2\x80\x99s not like I\xe2\x80\x99m running up and down the streets just buying myself berets. I bought one, like, a month ago, and it was back-ordered, look, it finally arrived, all right?\nSheldon: All right.\nPenny: Oh, my God, would you just get off my case?\nLeonard: Weird.\nSheldon: Oh, good, that was an unusual interaction. I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure.\nLeonard: Did you guys have an argument?\nSheldon: No.\nLeonard: Well, you clearly did something to aggravate her.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m at a loss. If you like, you can review my daily log of social interactions and see if there\xe2\x80\x99s a blunder I overlooked.\nScene: The apartment.\n  Leonard: Here you go. Oh, you owe me another two dollars. The price of mu-shu pork went up.\nHoward: It\xe2\x80\x99s getting tougher and tougher to be a bad Jew.\nLeonard: Here you go, Penny. Shrimp with lobster sauce.\nPenny: Thank you, Leonard. What\xe2\x80\x99s my share?\nLeonard: Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry about it. It\xe2\x80\x99s my treat.\nPenny: No, really, how much?\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s, whatever. Ten, eleven dollars.\nPenny: Well, which is it, ten or eleven?\nLeonard: Fourteen fifty, but it\xe2\x80\x99s no biggie, you\xe2\x80\x99ll get the next one. (Raj whispers something to Howard)\nPenny: What?\nHoward: He was just wondering if he wore skintight jeans and a tank top if he\xe2\x80\x99d get his shrimp lo mein for free.\nPenny: What are you saying? That I\xe2\x80\x99m using my body to get dinner? That I\xe2\x80\x99m some kind of Chinese food prostitute?\nHoward: Yeah, Raj, what are you saying?\nPenny: \xe2\x80\x98Cause let me tell you something, buddy, I pay my own way in this world, okay? I don\xe2\x80\x99t rely on anybody! (Raj runs out of the room) What was that about?\nHoward: He has a nervous bladder when he\xe2\x80\x99s stressed out. Kind of like a puppy.\nPenny: Here, Leonard, ten, eleven, twelve, uh, fourteen dollars.\nLeonard: It was fourteen fifty, but it\xe2\x80\x99s okay.\nSheldon: Oh, good. Dinner\xe2\x80\x99s here.\nPenny: Yes, dinner\xe2\x80\x99s here, and I\xe2\x80\x99m having some. I\xe2\x80\x99m having takeout food.\nSheldon: Okay.\nPenny: You\xe2\x80\x99re damn right it\xe2\x80\x99s okay. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been having leftovers at the restaurant for like four days, and I wanted something different. So sue me.\nSheldon: Forgive me, Penny, but that would be the very definition of a frivolous lawsuit.\nPenny: Sheldon, look, I will pay you back as soon as I can. You just have to give me more time.\nLeonard: Oh, wait, you lent her money?\nPenny: She needed money. You seem under pressure. Did I not lend you a sufficient amount? Because I can give you more.\nPenny: Oh, you know, you would just love that, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you? Yeah. You would just love to open up your little snake can and throw some money at the girl who can\xe2\x80\x99t pay her bills.\nLeonard: Where are you going?\nPenny: Going home, where I won\xe2\x80\x99t be interrogated like a criminal. I forgot my fortune cookie.\nSheldon: In case either of you have larceny in your heart, you should know that I\xe2\x80\x99ve moved my money out of the snake can.\nLeonard: But if you\xe2\x80\x99re ever short, there\xe2\x80\x99s always a couple of fifties in Green Lantern\xe2\x80\x99s ass.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\n  Leonard: Hey.\nPenny: Hey.\nLeonard: A little mood lighting, huh?\nPenny: Yeah. When I didn\xe2\x80\x99t pay my bill, the Department of Water and Power thought I would enjoy the ambience.\nLeonard: Yeah, they\xe2\x80\x99re very considerate that way.\nPenny: I used Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s money to pay my rent, then I had like fourteen dollars left over.\nLeonard: Fourteen dollars, huh?\nPenny: Put it back in your pocket, or I\xe2\x80\x99ll find some other place to put it.\nLeonard: Back in the pocket it goes. Look, you do understand that Sheldon really doesn\xe2\x80\x99t care when he gets the money back. It\xe2\x80\x99s actually one of the few idiosyncrasies that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make you want to, you know, kill him.\nPenny: Yeah, well, that\xe2\x80\x99s not really my big problem.\nLeonard: So you\xe2\x80\x99re a little behind on your bills. Everybody gets behind on their bills.\nPenny: Yeah, I know, it\xe2\x80\x99s just, this wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the plan, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t supposed to go this way.\nLeonard: Well, what was the plan?\nPenny: Um, waitress for six months and then become a movie star.\nLeonard: Was there a plan B?\nPenny: TV star.\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s probably not as bad as you think. Let\xe2\x80\x99s take a look. Maybe we can find some corners to cut. Oh, here\xe2\x80\x99s something, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t have electricity, then you probably don\xe2\x80\x99t need cable. Just a suggestion. 170 dollars for acting classes?\nPenny: Oh, no, I can\xe2\x80\x99t give up my acting classes. I\xe2\x80\x99m a professional actress.\nLeonard: You\xe2\x80\x99ve had an acting job where you got paid?\nPenny: That is not the definition of professional.\nLeonard: Actually, it kind of\xe2\x80\xa6 let\xe2\x80\x99s keep looking. Whoa, what\xe2\x80\x99s eighteen hundred dollars to the Los Angeles County Superior Court?\nPenny: Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s nothing.\nLeonard: Nothing? It sounds like you got caught speeding going 4,000 miles an hour.\nPenny: Well, remember Kurt?\nLeonard: Your ex-boyfriend?\nPenny: Yeah. He got arrested for taking a whiz on a cop car.\nLeonard: What?\nPenny: He was drunk.\nLeonard: I would hope so.\nPenny: Anyway, he had a bunch of outstanding tickets and a bench warrant, so I, you know, I paid his fines.\nLeonard: Did he pay you back?\nPenny: No, but he will.\nLeonard: And that\xe2\x80\x99s based on the inherent credit-worthiness of people who get drunk and urinate on police vehicles?\nPenny: Leonard, I\xe2\x80\x99m not gonna call up Kurt and ask him for money.\nLeonard: Well what are you gonna do?\nPenny: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, but I may have to find a cheaper place to live.\nLeonard: Oh, no. Oh, you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to do that.\nPenny: Why not?\nLeonard: Well, moving is a big deal. You have to go to the supermarket and get boxes, and if they\xe2\x80\x99re not clean, then your books smell like melons, and it\xe2\x80\x99s just, like\xe2\x80\xa6 Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you just get a roommate and stay here?\nPenny: Well, do you know anybody?\nLeonard: Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure the guy living with Sheldon wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t mind moving in with you.\nPenny: Oh, Leonard, honey, if we started living together, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be able to keep my hands off you.\nLeonard: Really?\nPenny: And you thought my acting lessons were a waste of money.\nScene: The apartment.\n  Howard: Ugh. This mu-shu pork\xe2\x80\x99s burning a hole through my duodenum.\nRaj: Leviticus 11:3: \xe2\x80\x9cOnly that which parteth the hoof and cheweth the cud among the beasts shall ye eat.\xe2\x80\x9d\nHoward: Hey, do I mock you with the Bhagavad-Gita every time you scarf down a Whopper?\nLeonard: Hey, what\xe2\x80\x99s going on?\nRaj: We\xe2\x80\x99re on a quest through the Valley of Fire to acquire the sacred crown.\nHoward: You want the Valley of Fire? It\xe2\x80\x99s right here.\nLeonard: Hey, you guys want to go on a real live quest?\nSheldon: Outside? I just made cocoa.\nLeonard: \xe2\x80\x93 Come on. It\xe2\x80\x99ll be fun.\nHoward: What is it?\nLeonard: Do you guys remember Penny\xe2\x80\x99s ex-boyfriend Kurt? (They all hold their hands above their heads) Yeah, that\xe2\x80\x99s him. It turns out he owes Penny a lot of money, and I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna go get it from him.\nWho\xe2\x80\x99s with me?\nHoward: Ooh, double sixes.\nLeonard: Really? You\xe2\x80\x99re just gonna let me go by myself?\nRaj: Oh, cool, I got a sword.\nLeonard: I could use some help.\nRaj: Here.\nLeonard: You guys are unbelievable, you play a game to simulate adventure, but when there\xe2\x80\x99s real adventure out there in the real world, you just wimp out.\nSheldon: Leonard, do you not recall the last time we visited this gentleman, we returned home without pants?\nLeonard: I do.\nSheldon: Are you sure? Because your proposal suggests that you don\xe2\x80\x99t.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m not afraid of him.\nSheldon: All right. Leonard fairly calls the question, who is in favour of abandoning our game and confronting Penny\xe2\x80\x99s steroid-infused ex-boyfriend in a suicidal mission to extract money from him? Say hi to Kurt for us.\nLeonard: Excuse me. When Frodo left the Shire to take the one ring to Mordor, didn\xe2\x80\x99t Samwise, Pippin and Merry go with him?\nSheldon: They did.\nLeonard: Well?\nSheldon: They had a terrible time of it, Leonard.\nRaj: Plus, no one stole their pants.\nLeonard: Fine. Just enjoy your little game. I\xe2\x80\x99ll make this quest on my own.\nHoward: Leonard, wait. Take a jacket, it\xe2\x80\x99s spritzing a little.\nLeonard: You guys suck. (Leaves. Comes back) Come on, please? He\xe2\x80\x99s so big.\nScene: Outside Kurt\xe2\x80\x99s door.\n  Leonard: Okay, is everyone clear on the plan?\nHoward: Yes. Koothrappali\xe2\x80\x99s going to wet himself, I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna throw up, Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s gonna run away, and you\xe2\x80\x99re going to die. Shall we synchronize our watches?\nLeonard: Guys, there are four of us and one of him.\nSheldon: Which means his triumph will be even larger. Minstrels will write songs about him.\nLeonard: Okay, how about this? I\xe2\x80\x99ll do the talking, you just stand behind me and try to look formidable.\nRaj: I should\xe2\x80\x99ve peed before we left.\nKurt: Yeah?\nLeonard: Hi, Kurt.\nKurt: Lenny, right?\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t really go by Lenny, but that\xe2\x80\x99s okay. Um, you remember Sheldon, Howard and Raj.\nKurt: No. What do you want?\nSheldon: You don\xe2\x80\x99t remember me? How could he not remember me?\nLeonard: Sheldon, not now.\nSheldon: I remember him.\nLeonard: Okay, here it is. Penny\xe2\x80\x99s in kind of a financial jam, and the money that you owe her would go a long way to solving her problems.\nKurt: And she sent you to get it from me?\nLeonard: No, no, she\xe2\x80\x99s too proud to ask for the money. I, on the other hand, feel you should honour your debt.\nKurt: You do?\nLeonard: Feel is a kind of a\xe2\x80\xa6 it\xe2\x80\x99s a strong word. Um, I just think it would be a nice gesture on your part.\nKurt: She\xe2\x80\x99ll get it when she gets it.\nHoward: Well, there you go. Problem solved.\nRaj: A successful quest. Now let\xe2\x80\x99s go find a gas station with a clean bathroom.\nLeonard: No, the problem isn\xe2\x80\x99t solved. He just blew us off.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99ve got it. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t remember me because the last time we met I was in a Halloween costume.\nHoward: Come on, Leonard, let\xe2\x80\x99s go\nLeonard: No. You can leave if you want to. I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna see this through.\nHoward: Okay. (They leave)\nLeonard: I guess, technically, that was my fault. (Knocks) I\xe2\x80\x99m not leaving here without Penny\xe2\x80\x99s money.\nKurt: What happened to your backup?\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t need backup. I have right on my side. And I\xe2\x80\x99m wearing cargo shorts under my pants.\nScene: Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s car.\nSheldon: Congratulations. You may not have succeeded in getting cash, but you did secure a formal acknowledgment of the debt. (Leonard has \xe2\x80\x9cI owe Penny $1800, Kurt\xe2\x80\x9d written on his forehead.)\n  Howard: Maybe we should have your head notarized.\nRaj: If anybody cares, I still have to pee.\nScene: Outside the apartment. Penny knocks.\nLeonard: Hey.\nPenny: Hey, is Sheldon here?\nLeonard: Yeah. Hang on. Sheldon!\nPenny: Nice hat.\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s kind of a fashionable look these days.\nPenny: Maybe if you\xe2\x80\x99re working on a tuna boat.\nSheldon: Hello, Penny.\nPenny: Sheldon, here is your money. Thank you very much. It helped a lot.\nSheldon: Sarcasm?\nPenny: No.\nSheldon: Darn. I can\xe2\x80\x99t seem to get the hang of that.\nLeonard: Hey, I know it\xe2\x80\x99s none of my business, but where did the money come from?\nPenny: Well, I cut back my expenses like you said and picked up a few more hours at the restaurant, but the biggest thing was, out of the blue, Kurt shows up and gives me the money he owes me.\nLeonard: Really? Did he say why?\nPenny: Yes, he said he was feeling guilty and wanted to do what was right.\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99s it? Did he give any reason as to why he came to this moral epiphany?\nPenny: Nope. I just think he\xe2\x80\x99s really changed. We\xe2\x80\x99re having dinner tomorrow night, and I get to wear my new beret. Bye, guys.\nLeonard: Bye.\nSheldon: Well done, Leonard. The true hero doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seek adulation, he fights for right and justice simply because it\xe2\x80\x99s his nature.\nLeonard: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s hooking up with her jerk of an ex-boyfriend and I have indelible ink on my forehead!\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s your badge of honour, your warrior\xe2\x80\x99s wound, if you will. I was wrong, minstrels will write songs about you.\nLeonard: Great.\nSheldon (sings): There once was a brave lad named Leonard, with a fi-fi-fiddle-dee-dee. He faced a fearsome giant, while Raj just wanted to pee.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
