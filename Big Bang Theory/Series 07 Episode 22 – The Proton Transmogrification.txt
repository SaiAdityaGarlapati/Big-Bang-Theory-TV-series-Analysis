b'Scene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Gentlemen, Star Wars Day is rapidly approaching. We should finalize our plans.\nPenny: What? That\xe2\x80\x99s a real thing? What is it, Star Wars Christmas?\nHoward: No. Don\xe2\x80\x99t be ridiculous. That\xe2\x80\x99s Wookiee Life Day.\nPenny: So, when is it?\nLeonard: Uh, well, it\xe2\x80\x99s not May the fifth, and it\xe2\x80\x99s not May the third. It\xe2\x80\x99s May the fourth.\nSheldon: Get it?\nRaj: May the fourth be with you?\nLeonard: May the force be with you. Get it?\nPenny: Oh, no. This face wasn\xe2\x80\x99t because I didn\xe2\x80\x99t get it.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom. There is a knock on the door.\nSheldon: Come in.\nLeonard: Hey, you got a second?\nSheldon: Yes. Actually, I\xe2\x80\x99m glad you\xe2\x80\x99re here. I\xe2\x80\x99m working on the Star Wars Day schedule. Now, I have a window built in after Phantom Menace for complaining, but I\xe2\x80\x99m worried an hour won\xe2\x80\x99t be enough time.\nLeonard: Sheldon, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got some bad news.\nSheldon: What is it?\nLeonard: I just read online that Arthur Jeffries passed away.\nSheldon: Professor Proton is dead?\nLeonard: Sorry, buddy.\nSheldon: What are you doing?\nLeonard: Comforting you?\nSheldon: Your heart might be in the right place, but your head, chest and arms certainly aren\xe2\x80\x99t.\nLeonard: Anyway, the, the funeral\xe2\x80\x99s on Sunday.\nSheldon: But, that\xe2\x80\x99s Star Wars Day.\nLeonard: Yeah, um, of all the things about this that are sad, that might not be number one. You okay? I know he meant a lot to you.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m fine.\nLeonard: Okay. Yet he cried when they changed the Raisin Bran box.\nScene: Amy\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nProfessor Proton (on youtube): This, uh, this is something interesting boys and girls. After an owl eats, he spits up part of his meal that he can\xe2\x80\x99t digest, in the form of a pellet. Is, isn\xe2\x80\x99t that a hoot? We\xe2\x80\x99ll be right back after I fire my writers. (Owl hoots) Oh, shut up.\nAmy: Watching your old friend?\nSheldon: Hmm. Yes. Look at him, Amy. It\xe2\x80\x99s such a shame. Struck down in the prime of my life.\nAmy: Do you want me to go to the funeral with you?\nSheldon: Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to the funeral.\nAmy: Why not?\nSheldon: All those people blowing their noses. You can\xe2\x80\x99t tell the sick from the sad. Mm. I\xe2\x80\x99ll be at home celebrating Star Wars Day, as planned.\nAmy: Are you sure you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to go say good-bye?\nSheldon: Amy, mourning the inevitable is a complete waste of time.\nAmy: And watching a bunch of goofy space movies you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen hundreds of times isn\xe2\x80\x99t?\nSheldon: If we were in a physical relationship, you just lost sex tonight.\nScene: The apartment.\nPenny: Hey, guys.\nRaj: Hey, Penny. Happy Star Wars Day.\nPenny: Okay.\nRaj: Can I make you breakfast? Admiral Ackbar\xe2\x80\x99s Snack Bar is open for business.\nPenny: No, thanks. Leonard and I are just going to the funeral.\nHoward: You sure. Not even coffee? We have R2-Decaf. Maybe a nice Cafe Au Leia?\nRaj: And if you\xe2\x80\x99re not in the mood for coffee I can always make you a Chai Tea-3PO.\nPenny: Oh, I get it, like C3PO. What happened to me?\nRaj: Hey, uh, Sheldon, you want anything?\nSheldon: Uh, no, thank you.\nHoward: You\xe2\x80\x99re being so quiet. Are you upset or are you just rebooting?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m fine.\nPenny: Sweetie, are you sure you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to come with us to the funeral?\nSheldon: Oh, I appreciate the offer, but Arthur is gone and there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing I can do about it. When Darth Vader struck down Obi-Wan, did Luke cry like a baby and go to his funeral?\nPenny: No, he blew up the Death Star. Why do I know this?\nSheldon: Arthur Jeffries was a scientist. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure he didn\xe2\x80\x99t care about silly superstitions like funerals. You know, if he were here, I think he\xe2\x80\x99d say enjoy Star Wars Day.\nLeonard: He was 84, he\xe2\x80\x99d say where\xe2\x80\x99s my pudding?\nRaj: Before you go, at least let me pack you some Attack of the Scones for the road.\nPenny: Oh, like Attack of the Clones. We are leaving right now.\nScene: Amy\xe2\x80\x9ds apartment.\nAmy: Arthur passing away was harder on Sheldon than he\xe2\x80\x99s ready to admit. Really hoping this will cheer him up.\nBernadette: Me, too. Although, it might\xe2\x80\x99ve been thoughtless of us to bake a Death Star cake.\nAmy: No, it combines two of Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s favorite things, chocolate chips and the ability to destroy a planet at the push of a button.\nBernadette: Well, anyway, it\xe2\x80\x99ll be a nice surprise for the boys. And Howie doesn\xe2\x80\x99t think I take his interests seriously, so hopefully this will keep him fooled for a while.\nAmy: Okay, let\xe2\x80\x99s get the fondant and start decorating.\nBernadette: This is pretty cool. You don\xe2\x80\x99t see too many spherical cakes.\nAmy: I wonder why that is.\nScene: The funeral.\nPenny: I have a confession to make.\nLeonard: Hmm?\nPenny: I\xe2\x80\x99ve never been to a funeral before.\nLeonard: Really?\nPenny: I just never knew anyone that died. I had a pet pig when I was a kid. I mean, when he died, we didn\xe2\x80\x99t have a funeral, we had a barbecue.\nLeonard: Yeah, we won\xe2\x80\x99t be eating Arthur tonight.\nPenny: I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know him very well, but I still really liked him. It\xe2\x80\x99s weird that he\xe2\x80\x99s just gone.\nLeonard: I know.\nPenny: I feel like I want to cry.\nLeonard: Oh that\xe2\x80\x99s, that\xe2\x80\x99s fine. Go ahead.\nPenny: I can\xe2\x80\x99t do it with you staring at me.\nLeonard: Sorry.\nPenny: No, I\xe2\x80\x99m dry. You\xe2\x80\x99re a big crybaby, you start, I\xe2\x80\x99ll join in.\nLeonard: I am not a crybaby.\nPenny: Toy Story 3?\nLeonard: The toys were holding hands in a furnace. Look, Arthur lived a full life. And he inspired a lot of people. Sure, he, he was my childhood hero, but the fact that I got to work with him, side by side, before he died was, it was, it was a gift.\nPenny: It was a gift. Thank you for being the emotional one in this relationship.\nLeonard: I got your back.\nPenny: Yeah.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Okay, here we go. Episode I: The Phantom Menace.\nRaj: Ugh, let\xe2\x80\x99s get this over with.\nHoward: Since we all agree Episode I isn\xe2\x80\x99t our favourite, maybe we just skip it this time.\nSheldon: Howard, I think you of all people should avoid espousing the principle that if something is not our favourite we should just get rid of it.\nRaj: You know, I heard of this way of watching the movies called the Machete Order, where you watch Episodes IV and V, then skip Episode I, watch II and III as a flashback, and then finish with VI.\nHoward: Okay, so you\xe2\x80\x99d lose most of Jar Jar, all the trade route talk and the boring senate hearings, which are like watching C-SPAN with monsters.\nSheldon: Get rid of the trade route part? Then how would Palpatine get Chancellor Valorum kicked out of office? How would he get himself elected? How? Can we get through one holiday without you saying something ridiculous?\nRaj: It was just a suggestion.\nSheldon: Well, you know what else was just a suggestion? Why don\xe2\x80\x99t we change the Raisin Bran box? Hmm? And you know who got hurt by that? Every single person who eats breakfast.\nRaj: Wow.\nHoward: I think he\xe2\x80\x99s taking this Professor Proton thing pretty hard.\nRaj: Should we try to console him?\nHoward: Or should we respect his privacy in this moment of grief?\nRaj: By staying here and watching the movie.\nHoward: That\xe2\x80\x99s what good friends would do.\nScene: Later.\nHoward: Well, at least without Sheldon here, we got to start with Episode IV.\nRaj: Mm, true. I do feel guilty about him.\nHoward: Me, too.\nRaj: Maybe we should see how he\xe2\x80\x99s doing.\nHoward: Yeah.\nRaj: But after the cantina scene.\nHoward: Obviously.\nScene: Sheldon, dreaming he is in the living room of the apartment on his laptop.\nSheldon: Look at Arthur, cracking up at a joke I told him. I\xe2\x80\x99ll never hear that laugh again.\nArthur: You never heard it that time.\nSheldon: Arthur. I thought you were dead.\nArthur: I am. Oh, it, it\xe2\x80\x99s fantastic. I mean this, this is the longest that I\xe2\x80\x99ve gone without running into a men\xe2\x80\x99s room in, in, in years.\nSheldon: Why are you here?\nArthur: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I was, I was hoping I was going to haunt my ex-wife.\nSheldon: I know why. You\xe2\x80\x99ve come to me because you\xe2\x80\x99re my Obi-Wan.\nArthur: I\xe2\x80\x99m, I\xe2\x80\x99m not, I\xe2\x80\x99m not familiar with that. Is, is, is that an, an Internet?\nSheldon: Wow. Uh, you\xe2\x80\x99re dead, so I\xe2\x80\x99m going to let that slide. Obi-Wan Kenobi is a character from Star Wars. After his physical demise, he comes to Luke Skywalker as his mentor in spirit form.\nArthur: Well, that, that clears that up.\nSheldon: You must be here to give me advice.\nArthur: Well, this, this is weird. Most, most of my robes open in, in the back.\nSheldon: Those are your Jedi robes.\nArthur: Oh, wait. What, what, what is, what is this?\nSheldon: Be careful with that.\nArthur: Oh. Oh. Oh, neato. I\xe2\x80\x99m, uh, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to need a Band-Aid.\nScene: The funeral.\nLeonard: So, what did you think of your first funeral?\nPenny: Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be a jerk, but it was kind of a bummer.\nLeonard: Yeah, well, when I die, you can rent a bounce house.\nPenny: You think about dying?\nLeonard: Mm. Well, I think more about if I\xe2\x80\x99d have any regrets.\nPenny: What would you regret?\nLeonard: Mm, you know, that I didn\xe2\x80\x99t travel more, take more risks, learn another language.\nPenny: You know Klingon.\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99s true.\nPenny: No, I meant that as a regret.\nLeonard: I just thought of one more.\nPenny: What\xe2\x80\x99s that?\nLeonard: I regret not saying yes when you asked me to marry you.\nPenny: Well, it just wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the right time.\nLeonard: Yeah.\nPenny: And this is also not the right time. Do not propose.\nLeonard: What?\nPenny: I know that face. That\xe2\x80\x99s your propose face.\nLeonard: I was not gonna propose. It\xe2\x80\x99s already two to one.\nPenny: What\xe2\x80\x99s two to one?\nLeonard: I proposed twice, you proposed once. Two to one.\nPenny: Oh, my. It\xe2\x80\x99s not a contest.\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you\xe2\x80\x99re upset about. I\xe2\x80\x99m the one who\xe2\x80\x99s losing.\nPenny: Okay. Fine. Would you feel better if I propose so you could turn me down again?\nLeonard: Yeah, I think I would.\nPenny: Okay. Leonard, will you marry me?\nLeonard: Hmm.\nPenny: No, don\xe2\x80\x99t you dare. You reject me right now and tie things up.\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s just such a big decision. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to have any regrets.\nScene: Amy\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nAmy: Did you ever watch Professor Proton when you were a kid?\nBernadette: No. My dad controlled the TV, so unless someone was a Texas Ranger, Jake or the Fatman, we didn\xe2\x80\x99t see it.\nAmy: I never watched him, either, but he seems to be the reason that Sheldon got interested in science.\nBernadette: Not me. I got into science \xe2\x80\x99cause I was always the smallest kid in school, so I thought if I became a scientist, I could invent a formula that made me taller.\nAmy: That\xe2\x80\x99s cute.\nBernadette: Yeah, I thought it was working for a while, but then I found out my brother was just lowering the pencil marks on the door frame. How about you?\nAmy: Oh, I guess it must have been back when I was in the Girl Sprouts.\nBernadette: Girl Sprouts?\nAmy: My mom made it up as an alternative to the Girl Scouts. She didn\xe2\x80\x99t want me selling cookies on some street corner like a whore.\nBernadette: How did that get you into science?\nAmy: Oh, I went to the library and took out a book on biology to see what whores did.\nScene: Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s car.\nLeonard: On the one hand, if I say yes\xe2\x80\xa6\nPenny: This isn\xe2\x80\x99t funny anymore. Just say no so we\xe2\x80\x99re done with this. Will you marry me or not?\nLeonard: Ooh, interesting. Did you just propose to me again?\nPenny: No.\nLeonard: Really? Because I just heard will you marry me? That\xe2\x80\x99s two proposals, one day. Sounds like someone wants to spend the rest of her life telling people how to spell the name Hofstadter.\nPenny: You know what? Fine. Do whatever you want.\nLeonard: Hey. Penny, don\xe2\x80\x99t get upset. Here. I love you, but, no, I will not marry you.\nPenny: Thank you.\nLeonard: Now, about that second proposal. On the one hand\xe2\x80\xa6\nScene: Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s dream.\nArthur: Where, where, where are we?\nSheldon: This is the swampland of Dagobah. It\xe2\x80\x99s where Luke was trained in the ways of the Jedi.\nArthur: Oh. Too bad. I thought it was Florida.\nSheldon: When Obi-Wan came to Luke on this very spot, he gave him all sorts of helpful advice. So, um, what do you got for me?\nArthur: Um, always, get, get a prenup.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s it? I thought there\xe2\x80\x99d be more of a reason why you\xe2\x80\x99re here.\nArthur: Well, why, why do you think I\xe2\x80\x99m here?\nSheldon: I suppose it has something to do with your recent passing.\nArthur: Is, is this the, the first time you\xe2\x80\x99ve lost, you know, someone close to you?\nSheldon: Oh, no. No. I\xe2\x80\x99ve already had to say good-bye to 11 Dr. Whos.\nArthur: Yeah, I\xe2\x80\x99ve, I\xe2\x80\x99ve outlived a few of my doctors, too.\nSheldon: Of course, my grandfather died when I was five. My father died when I was 14.\nArthur: I\xe2\x80\x99m, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry about that.\nSheldon: And now you\xe2\x80\x99re gone, too. It\xe2\x80\x99s like all the men I\xe2\x80\x99ve looked up to have gone away.\nArthur: Well, you know, it\xe2\x80\x99s, it\xe2\x80\x99s okay to, to be sad about them. Just, just make sure, you know, you appreciate those who, who are still there for you.\nSheldon: But I do appreciate them.\nArthur: Well, then, what am I doing in a swamp dressed like Friar Tuck? Appreciate them, Sheldon. (Sheldon is woken up by a knocking on his bedroom door.)\nLeonard: Hey, buddy. Heard you\xe2\x80\x99re having a rough day. You all right?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m okay. How was the funeral?\nLeonard: It was nice, you know. A lot of people showed up, told some great stories about him. Did you know that Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s son is a high school sci\xe2\x80\xa6? (Sheldon hugs him) Hey, the guys are about to start Jedi. You want to go watch?\nSheldon: I do. After I make them go back and watch one through five first.\nLeonard: Sheldon, that, that\xe2\x80\x99ll take us all night.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s true. Oh, it\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing I had a nap.\nScene: The apartment.\nHoward: Boy, some of the physical comedy with Jar Jar is a little tough to watch.\nLeonard: At least they toned him down in the second one.\nPenny: Yeah, he is pretty stupid.\nRaj: Hey, we can say it. You can\xe2\x80\x99t.\nAmy: Hey, guys.\nBernadette: Happy Star Wars Day.\nSheldon: Wow. A Death Star cake.\nAmy: Yeah. We were hoping it might cheer you up.\nBernadette: And even though it meant we had to miss the movies, we could still be part of the fun.\nHoward: Well, you didn\xe2\x80\x99t miss anything. We just started over.\nBernadette: Son of a bitch.\nScene: The same, everyone is falling asleep.\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re back.\nArthur: Yeah, apparently, um, I\xe2\x80\x99m here whenever, when, whenever you need me.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s nice.\nArthur: May, maybe for you.\nSheldon: Why do I need you now?\nArthur: Well, as near as I could tell, you, you fell asleep watching Star Wars, and now you\xe2\x80\x99re, you\xe2\x80\x99re dreaming you\xe2\x80\x99re watching Star Wars.\nSheldon: So?\nArthur: I mean, don\xe2\x80\x99t, don\xe2\x80\x99t you see a problem there? I mean, how, how you\xe2\x80\x99re spending your limited time on Earth?\nSheldon: Not at all.\nArthur: Okay, good luck to you.\nAdvertisements'
