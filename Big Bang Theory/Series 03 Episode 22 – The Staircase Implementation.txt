b'Scene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nPenny: Okay, Babydoll Pink, let\xe2\x80\x99s see if you can cover up the fact that I got my dad\xe2\x80\x99s feet.\nLeonard (voice off): It\xe2\x80\x99s just two degrees, Sheldon. I just want to turn up the thermostat two degrees!\nSheldon: (voice off): Let me point out that two degrees can be the difference between water and steam.\nLeonard (voice off): Yes, if we lived in a teakettle.\nSheldon: (voice off): This is the temperature you agreed to in the roommate agreement.\nLeonard (voice off): Aw, screw the roommate agreement!\nSheldon: (voice off): No, you don\xe2\x80\x99t screw the roommate agreement. The roommate agreement screws you.\nLeonard (voice off): You know what, go to Hell and set their thermostat.\nSheldon: (voice off): I don\xe2\x80\x99t have to go to Hell. At 73 degrees, I\xe2\x80\x99m there already!\nPenny (after a knock on the door): Who is it?\nLeonard: Leonard.\nPenny: Hang on.\nLeonard: Can I sleep on your couch tonight?\nPenny: Uh, well, you can try, but the people across the hall are being very noisy.\nLeonard: You heard that, huh?\nPenny: Apparently, the one fella tried to adjust the thermostat, then the other fella went bat-crap crazy.\nLeonard: So you agree, he\xe2\x80\x99s nuts.\nPenny: Well, not as nuts as the guy who chooses to live with him.\nLeonard: Believe it or not, he was worse when I met him.\nPenny: Oh, I do not believe that.\nLeonard: You are so naive. Just like I was seven years ago. (Flasback: The lobby) I\xe2\x80\x99d just started at the university.\nPast Leonard: Excuse me, I\xe2\x80\x99m looking for Sheldon Cooper\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nMan with a box: Oh, I bet you\xe2\x80\x99re here to check out the room for rent.\nPast Leonard: Yeah.\nMan: Run away, dude.\nPast Leonard: What?\nMan: Run fast, run far. (End of flashback.)\nLeonard: That should have been my first clue.\nScene: Moments later.\nPenny: So Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s last roommate tried to warn you off?\nLeonard: For all I knew, he was the crazy one. He had this really deranged look.\nPenny: Well, yeah, he\xe2\x80\x99d been living with Sheldon.\nLeonard: Sure, it makes sense now. (Flashback. Past Leonard is getting out of the lift). Anyway, I went upstairs and knocked on the door.\nLarge Black Transvestite: Yeah?\nPast Leonard: Dr. Cooper?\nTransvestite: No, you want the crazy guy across the hall.\nLeonard: In retrospect, that was clue number two.\nPast Sheldon: Yes?\nPast Leonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m Leonard Hofstadter. I called you about the apartment. You said\xe2\x80\xa6\nPast Sheldon: I know what I said. I know what you said. I know what my mother said on March 5, 1992. What is the sixth noble gas?\nPast Leonard: What?\nPast Sheldon: You said you\xe2\x80\x99re a scientist. What is the sixth noble gas?\nPast Leonard: Uh, radon?\nPast Sheldon: Are you asking me or telling me?\nPast Leonard: Telling you? Telling you.\nPast Sheldon: All right, next question. Kirk or Picard?\nPast Leonard: Oh, uh, well, that\xe2\x80\x99s tricky. Um, well, uh, Original Series over Next Generation, but Picard over Kirk.\nPast Sheldon: Correct. You\xe2\x80\x99ve passed the first barrier to roommate-hood. You may enter.\nPast Leonard (Enters apartment. It is bare except for two lawn chairs, a television and some whiteboards): Oh, this is pretty nice. Uh, the bedrooms are back there?\nPast Sheldon: That depends.\nPast Leonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand, their, their existence is conditional?\nPast Sheldon: No, but your ability to perceive their existence is conditional on you passing the second and third barriers.\nPast Leonard: There\xe2\x80\x99s three?\nPast Sheldon: Each more daunting than the last. Have a seat.\nPast Leonard: Okay.\nPast Sheldon: No! That\xe2\x80\x99s where I sit!\nPast Leonard: What\xe2\x80\x99s the difference?\nPast Sheldon: This seat is ideally located both in relation to the heat source in the winter and a cross breeze in the summer. It also faces the television at a direct angle allowing me to immerse myself in entertainment or game play without being subjected to conversation. As a result, I\xe2\x80\x99ve placed it in a state of eternal dibs.\nPast Leonard: Can you do that?\nPast Sheldon: Cathedra mea, regulae meae. That\xe2\x80\x99s Latin for my chair, my rules. Now, you said on the phone that your area of study is physics.\nPast Leonard: Uh, yeah, experimental physics.\nPast Sheldon: Hmm.\nPast Leonard: What is that?\nPast Sheldon: Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t concern you. You\xe2\x80\x99ll be going to the university every day?\nPast Leonard: Yes.\nPast Sheldon: And you have a vehicle?\nPast Leonard: A car, yeah.\nPast Sheldon: And you\xe2\x80\x99ll be willing to drive me?\nPast Leonard: Well, can\xe2\x80\x99t you drive?\nPast Sheldon: I can. I choose not to.\nPast Leonard: Okay, I suppose I could drive you. Well that\xe2\x80\x99s a point in my favour, right?\nPast Sheldon: Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you let me do this.\nPast Leonard: Come on, I just asked.\nPast Sheldon: Last question. In a post-apocalyptic world, which task would you assign the highest priority? Locating a sustainable food source, re-establishing a functioning government, procreating, or preserving the knowledge of mankind?\nPast Leonard: Uh, I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna go with preserving the knowledge.\nPast Sheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s correct. FYI, I would have accepted any answer other than procreating. Come, I\xe2\x80\x99ll show you the rest of the apartment.\nPast Leonard: Oh, good. I passed the barriers.\nPast Sheldon: The second barrier. Don\xe2\x80\x99t get cocky. This is the bathroom. Are you fairly regular?\nPast Leonard: Uh, I guess.\nPast Sheldon: This isn\xe2\x80\x99t going to work if you\xe2\x80\x99re guessing. When do you evacuate your bowels?\nPast Leonard: When I have to.\nPast Sheldon: When you have to? I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, I don\xe2\x80\x99t rent to hippies.\nPast Leonard: I, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, uh, in the morning. Around eight.\nPast Sheldon: I can\xe2\x80\x99t give you eight. I can give you seven thirty.\nPast Leonard: Fine. I\xe2\x80\x99ll take it.\nPast Sheldon: Third barrier passed. You have won the right to see your room. Huzzah!\nPast Leonard: Is this it?\nPast Sheldon: No, this is my room. People don\xe2\x80\x99t go in my room.\nPast Leonard: So where do you sleep?\nPast Sheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand.\nPast Leonard: If people don\xe2\x80\x99t go in there, and you\xe2\x80\x99re people, and\xe2\x80\xa6 You are people, aren\xe2\x80\x99t you? Making a joke.\nPast Sheldon: Do you do this often?\nPast Leonard: On occasion.\nPast Sheldon: Your room. You may want to repaint. (End of Flashback)\nPenny: Okay, and after all that, you just moved in?\nLeonard: No, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t just move in. First we had to iron out a few details. (Flashback: The apartment)\nPast Sheldon: Roommates agree that Friday nights shall be reserved for watching Joss Whedon\xe2\x80\x99s brilliant new series Firefly.\nPast Leonard: Does that really need to be in the agreement?\nPast Sheldon: We might as well settle it now, it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be on for years. Initial here. All right, that\xe2\x80\x99s television and movies. Section nine, miscellany. The apartment\xe2\x80\x99s flag is a gold lion rampant on a field of azure.\nPast Leonard: We have a flag?\nPast Sheldon: Never fly it upside down unless the apartment\xe2\x80\x99s in distress. And next, if either of us ever invents time travel, we agree our first stop will be this meeting today in precisely five seconds.\nPast Leonard: Okay.\nPast Sheldon: Well that\xe2\x80\x99s disappointing. (End of flashback.)\nPenny: Why on earth did you agree to all that?\nLeonard: It was the best apartment I\xe2\x80\x99d seen, the rent was very reasonable and after you\xe2\x80\x99ve passed the first three barriers you kind of want to take it all the way.\nPenny: Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, Leonard, it\xe2\x80\x99s very hard to feel sympathy for you.\nLeonard: Okay, how about this? Let me tell you about the first time I brought a girl over. (Flashback to Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom.)\nPast Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard?\nPast Leonard: Shh. Just pretend we\xe2\x80\x99re not here.\nPast Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard?Leonard?\nPast Leonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m sure he\xe2\x80\x99ll go away.\nPast Sheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m just going to keep knocking till you answer. (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard? (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard? (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard?\nPast Leonard: What do you want? I didn\xe2\x80\x99t say come in!\nPast Sheldon: You asked what I wanted. I wanted to come in. I\xe2\x80\x99m here because you violated our roommate agreement. Specifically, section eight, visitors, subsection C, females, paragraph four, coitus. Roommates shall give each other 12 hours notice of impending coitus.\xe2\x80\x9d\nPast Leonard: I didn\xe2\x80\x99t even know her 12 hours ago.\nJoyce Kim: That\xe2\x80\x99s it! I\xe2\x80\x99m out of here!\nPast Leonard: But, Joyce, come on.\nPast Sheldon: 12 hours? (End of flashback.)\nPenny: Oh, my God.\nLeonard: Do I get some sympathy now?\nPenny: A little bit. Okay. Let me get this straight. You move in with this guy, he makes you sign a ridiculous roommate agreement, then he walks into your bedroom while you\xe2\x80\x99re doing this Joyce Kim, and you still stay?\nLeonard: Actually, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get too mad at him about Joyce Kim.\nPenny: Why not?\nLeonard: Well, I was doing some government research at the time, you know, military, rocket fuel. It\xe2\x80\x99s kind of secret.\nPenny: What does that have to do with Joyce Kim?\nLeonard: As it turns out, she was a North Korean spy. Luckily, Sheldon drove her out before I revealed anything important. Which I\xe2\x80\x99m not saying I would have.\nPenny: So, what, that\xe2\x80\x99s it? You\xe2\x80\x99ve stayed with Sheldon all this time because he kept you from going to federal prison?\nLeonard: That was part of it. The other part is what happened with the elevator.\nPenny: Oh, yeah, I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering about that. You said it was working when you moved in.\nLeonard: It was, but one night, Sheldon came home from work\xe2\x80\xa6 (Flashback, the apartment. The settee has now appeared. Leonard, Howard and Raj are playing a video game.)\nPast Sheldon: What is going on here?\nPast Leonard: Hey, Sheldon. This is Howard and Raj. They work at the university, too.\nPast Howard: Hey.\nPast Raj: Hey.\nPast Sheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99ll get to you later. What are you sitting on?\nPast Howard: I can\xe2\x80\x99t speak for these guys, but I\xe2\x80\x99m sitting on my tushie. It\xe2\x80\x99s a joke.\nPast Leonard: Yeah, not a good idea.\nPast Raj: Tushie is buttocks, right?\nPast Howard: Right.\nPast Raj: Hilarious.\nPast Sheldon: Explain the couch.\nPast Leonard: Oh, well, there were some people on the first floor moving out, and they sold it to me for a hundred dollars. Howard and Raj helped me bring it up.\nPast Sheldon: But what\xe2\x80\x99s wrong with the furniture we have?\nPast Leonard: They\xe2\x80\x99re lawn chairs. And there was no place for company.\nPast Sheldon: Did it occur to you that was by design?\nPast Leonard: According to the roommate agreement, I\xe2\x80\x99m entitled to allocate 50% of the cubic footage of the common areas.\nPast Sheldon: But you didn\xe2\x80\x99t notify me by e-mail, so this is still a breach.\nPast Leonard: I did notify you.\nPast Sheldon: Oh, you did, did you? Oh, drat! Hoisted by my own spam filter.\nPast Leonard: What am I doing in your spam folder?\nPast Sheldon: I put you there after you forwarded me a picture of a cat playing the piano, entitled this is funny.\nPast Raj: Oh, yeah, I saw that. That was hilarious. (End of flashback.)\nPenny: Okay, what does all this have to do with the elevator?\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m getting to it. (Back to flashback.)\nPast Sheldon: I assure you, you\xe2\x80\x99ll be sorry you wasted your money on an iPod when Microsoft comes out with theirs.\nPast Raj: Okay, do you have an opinion about everything?\nPast Sheldon: Yes.\nPast Howard: And you just assume you\xe2\x80\x99re always right?\nPast Sheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s not an assumption. Change seats with me.\nPast Raj: Why?\nPast Sheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t like this spot. I have to keep turning my head.\nPast Raj: Fine.\nPast Leonard: Ooh, it\xe2\x80\x99s time for Babylon 5!\nPast Sheldon: We don\xe2\x80\x99t watch Babylon 5 in this apartment.\nPast Leonard: Why not?\nPast Sheldon: Because no one likes Babylon 5.\nPast Leonard: I like it.\nPast Raj: Me, too.\nPast Howard: So do I.\nPast Leonard: There you go\xe2\x80\x93 three against one.\nPast Sheldon: They don\xe2\x80\x99t get a vote. It\xe2\x80\x99s one against one. And according to the roommate agreement, all ties will be settled by me.\nPast Leonard: But I said no to that.\nPast Sheldon: And I said yes. And I settle all ties. Change seats with me.\nPast Howard: Why?\nPast Sheldon: There\xe2\x80\x99s a draft on my neck over here.\nPast Howard: So, I get the draft?\nPast Sheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re protected by your turtleneck.\nPast Howard: Fine. And it\xe2\x80\x99s a dickey.\nPast Sheldon: Hmm, I\xe2\x80\x99m still not comfortable. Of course. There\xe2\x80\x99s too many people here.\nPast Leonard: We can fix that. Let\xe2\x80\x99s leave.\nPast Howard: Yeah, we can go over to my place.\nPast Sheldon: Wait. Let me get my jacket.\nPast Howard: You\xe2\x80\x99re not going with us.\nPast Sheldon: Why not?\nPast Raj: You\xe2\x80\x99re the guy we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to get away from.\nPast Sheldon: Oh. Well, in that case, I don\xe2\x80\x99t need my jacket. And for the record, the correct syntax is I\xe2\x80\x99m the guy from whom you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to get away. Oh, yes, this is definitely going to be my spot. (End of flashback.)\nPenny: Okay, how do you know he said that? You left the room.\nLeonard: Hey, do you want me to finish working on your man feet or not?\nPenny: Fine. Go ahead. (Flashback to Howard\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom.)\nMrs Wolowitz: Howard, are you having a playdate?\nPast Howard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t have playdates! I have colleagues!\nMrs Wolowitz: Do their parents know they\xe2\x80\x99re here?\nPast Howard: No, but if you keep screaming, maybe they\xe2\x80\x99ll hear you!\nPast Leonard: That your dad?\nPast Howard: She grows any more hair on her face, yes.\nPast Leonard: Oh, man. Is that a two-stage rocket?\nPast Howard: Three. I designed the engine myself.\nPast Raj: Cool. Can it break Mach 1?\nPast Howard: Oh, probably, if I could get my hands on that new fuel the government\xe2\x80\x99s been working on.\nPast Leonard: Oh, this just might be your lucky day.\nMrs Wolowitz: Howard, what happened to the Oreos I left on the counter?!\nPast Howard: I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen your Oreos! Just take your bath without them! (End of flashback.)\nPenny: So, why was it his lucky day?\nLeonard: Well, it turns out I had a little rocket fuel in the apartment.\nPenny: What were you doing with rocket fuel in your apartment?\nLeonard: Mm, Joyce Kim was kind of curious about what I did for a living, and I was going to kind of show it to her. It\xe2\x80\x99s not important. The point is, the guys and I went back to the apartment.\nPenny: Are we ever going to get to the elevator?\nLeonard: Yeah, we\xe2\x80\x99re really close. Uh, uh, we\xe2\x80\x99re at the apartment. (Flashback.)\nPast Leonard: The trick is to mix it into Tovex in order to create a combustible gel that will generate over 8,000 kilonewtons of thrust.\nPast Howard: Nice.\nPast Raj: Cool.\nPast Sheldon: Won\xe2\x80\x99t work.\nPast Leonard: Excuse me, but I\xe2\x80\x99ve been working on this a long time. Trust me, it\xe2\x80\x99ll work.\nPast Sheldon: You don\xe2\x80\x99t see your mistake, do you?\nPast Leonard: There\xe2\x80\x99s no mistake.\nPast Sheldon: This is for a full-scale rocket, not a model.\nPast Leonard: Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ve adjusted the formula.\nPast Sheldon: Not correctly.\nPast Leonard: Okay, I\xe2\x80\x99ve had it with you. You might be an expert on theoretical physics and science-fiction programs and where to sit on a freaking couch, but this is applied physics. And when it comes to applied physic\xe2\x80\xa6 uh-oh.\nPast Howard: What\xe2\x80\x99s happening?\nPast Leonard: A bad thing. A very bad thing. Get the door. Get the door! Get the door! Get the door! Get the door!\nPast Howard: You\xe2\x80\x99re waiting for the elevator?\nPast Leonard: Oh. Right.\nPast Raj: Wait. It\xe2\x80\x99s here.\nPast Sheldon: Give me that. (Takes the rocket fuel. Puts it in elevator. Presses button and jumps out.)\nPast Leonard: What\xe2\x80\x99d you do that for? I had plenty of time. (Elevator explodes.)\nPast Sheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re welcome. (End of flashback.)\nLeonard: Not only did Sheldon save my life, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t rat me out to the landlord. Or the police. Or Homeland Security.\nPenny: Okay, so, basically, you\xe2\x80\x99re the reason I have to walk up and down three flights of stairs every day?\nLeonard: So I did something stupid. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you did stupid things when you were younger. What were you doing seven years ago?\nPenny: Excuse me, I was in high school. Studying, keeping my nose clean, doing volunteer work for the community. (Flashback. Penny is in her bedroom, sitting on the bed with a guy, looking at a pregnancy tester.)\nPast Penny: Not pregnant. Yes!\nScene: The apartment.\n  Sheldon: Oh, Ubuntu, you are my favourite Linux-based operating system.\nLeonard: Hey.\nSheldon: Hello. Why do I smell methacrylate?\nLeonard: Oh, uh, clear nail polish. I had a mani-pedi. Men can get those. Anyway, I may owe you an apology.\nSheldon: There\xe2\x80\x99s doubt?\nLeonard: I did agree to the thermostat setting, and I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have tried to change it.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s not an apology, simply an acknowledgement that I was right.\nLeonard: Okay, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.\nSheldon: There you go.\nLeonard: So, we\xe2\x80\x99re good?\nSheldon: Good what?\nLeonard: Never mind. Okay if I watch some TV?\nSheldon: Go ahead.\nTelevision voice: Up next Babylon 5.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\n  Leonard (voice off): You\xe2\x80\x99re not even watching!\nSheldon (voice off): I can hear it!\nLeonard (voice off): Oh, so the dialogue offends you?\nSheldon (voice off): I would hardly call that dialogue!\nLeonard (voice off): You\xe2\x80\x99re insane, you know that?!\nSheldon (voice off): Don\xe2\x80\x99t make me turn that flag upside down, \xe2\x80\x99cause you know I\xe2\x80\x99ll do it!\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
