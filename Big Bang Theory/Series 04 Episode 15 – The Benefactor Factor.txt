b'Scene: The University cafeteria\nRaj: Here\xe2\x80\x99s what I wonder about zombies. (Others all groan) What happens if they can\xe2\x80\x99t get any human flesh to eat? They can\xe2\x80\x99t starve to death, they\xe2\x80\x99re already dead.\nHoward: You take this one. I spent an hour last night on how do vampires shave when they can\xe2\x80\x99t see themselves in the mirror?\nSheldon: Well-groomed vampires meet in pairs and shave each other. Case closed.\nRaj: Yeah, okay, so, zombies.\nLeonard: I guess it depends on the zombies, Raj. Are we talking slow zombies, fast zombies? Like, in 28 Days, if those zombies didn\xe2\x80\x99t eat, they starved.\nHoward: You\xe2\x80\x99re thinking of 28 Days Later. 28 Days is where Sandra Bullock goes to rehab and puts the audience into an undead state\nRaj: Hey, don\xe2\x80\x99t bag on Sandra Bullock! You think it makes you look cultured, but you just come off as bitter.\nLeonard: Oh, Dr. Siebert, twelve o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\nHoward: Why\xe2\x80\x99s the president of the university slumming in the cafeteria?\nSheldon: Perhaps he\xe2\x80\x99s emulating Shakespeare\xe2\x80\x99s Henry V, who dressed as a commoner and mingled among them, to find out how he was being perceived by his subjects. Course, if he\xe2\x80\x99d have read any of the thirteen hundred e-mails I\xe2\x80\x99ve sent him on the subject of his administration, he could have saved himself the trouble.\nRaj: Or maybe he heard it\xe2\x80\x99s Tator Tot Tuesday. That\xe2\x80\x99s why I\xe2\x80\x99m here.\nDr. Seibert: Hey, there\xe2\x80\x99s my favorite geniuses! How are we doing today?\nSheldon: That depends, how much longer do you plan on fondling my shoulder?\nSeibert: Sorry, Dr. Cooper, I forgot you have a touch phobia.\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s not a touch phobia, it\xe2\x80\x99s a germ phobia. If you\xe2\x80\x99d like to go put on a pair of latex gloves,\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll let you check me for a hernia.\nSeibert: Yeah. So, listen, fellas, who\xe2\x80\x99s up for a little party this Saturday night? Open bar, good eats, might even be a few pretty girls.\nRaj: Sounds great!\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m in!\nSheldon: Hold on. Just because the nice man is offering you candy, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean you should jump into his windowless van. What\xe2\x80\x99s the occasion?\nSeibert: Just a little fund-raiser for the university.\nSheldon: Aha! The tear-stained air mattress in the back of the van.\nSeibert: I understand your reticence, Dr. Cooper, and I sympathize, but the hard facts are, occasionally, we have to shake a few hands and kiss a few butts to raise money for our research.\nSheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t care, it\xe2\x80\x99s demeaning. And I refuse to be trotted out and shown off like a prize hog at the Texas State Fair. Which, by the way, is something you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to attend wearing a Star Trek ensign\xe2\x80\x99s uniform.\nSeibert: All right, let me put it this way. You\xe2\x80\x99re gonna put on a suit, you\xe2\x80\x99re gonna come to this party, and you\xe2\x80\x99re gonna explain your research to a bunch of old people, or I swear to God, I\xe2\x80\x99ll blind you with a hot spoon, like they did to that little boy in Slumdog Millionaire.\nRaj: Oh, you don\xe2\x80\x99t want that.\nSeibert: So, Saturday night! It\xe2\x80\x99s gonna be off the hook.\nSheldon: Ugh!\nSeibert: Get over it.\nRaj: Oh, boy! Tator tots and a party invitation? What a great day!\nCredits sequence.\n  Scene: The apartment.\nPenny: There you go.\nLeonard: Are you sure this is right?\nPenny: Yeah, just tuck that part in your pants;  you\xe2\x80\x99ll be fine.\nHoward: Okay, let\xe2\x80\x99s go smooch some rich, wrinkled tuckus.\nPenny: Oh, Howard, I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe Bernadette let you go to a fancy party wearing a dickey.\nHoward: Excuse me, my girlfriend doesn\xe2\x80\x99t pick out my clothes. My mother does.\nLeonard: Oh. We should get going.\nHoward: What about Sheldon?\nSheldon: Sheldon is not going.\nLeonard: Really? What do we tell Siebert?\nSheldon: Tell him Dr. Cooper feels that the best use of his time is to employ his rare and precious mental faculties to tear the mask off nature and stare at the face of God.\nPenny: Sheldon, it\xe2\x80\x99s Saturday night, you\xe2\x80\x99ll be doing laundry.\nSheldon: Don\xe2\x80\x99t tell him that, tell him the mask thing.\nScene: The party.\nHoward: Hey, put your tie back in your pants.\nLeonard: Thanks.\nRaj: Nice place. Reminds me of my parents\xe2\x80\x99 house back in New Delhi.\nHoward: You\xe2\x80\x99re kidding.\nRaj: No. We are very wealthy. But the only difference is, we have more servants.\nLeonard: More than this?\nRaj: More than we can use. You see, in India, we don\xe2\x80\x99t make the mistake of letting our poor people have dreams.\nSeibert: Ah. There\xe2\x80\x99s my band of brainiacs. Where\xe2\x80\x99s Dr. Cooper?\nLeonard: He\xe2\x80\x99s tearing the mask off nature to look at the face of God.\nSeibert: The board of directors insists he has a beautiful mind. I think he\xe2\x80\x99s just bananas. Come on, let me introduce you to one of the university\xe2\x80\x99s leading donors.\nRaj: I think we were misled about the cute girls.\nSeibert: Mrs. Latham, I\xe2\x80\x99d like you to meet three of our outstanding young researchers. This is Dr. Leonard Hofstadter, Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali and Howard Wolowitz.\nMrs Latham: Well, what happened to you, Wolowitz, couldn\xe2\x80\x99t stick with it long enough to get your PhD?\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m an engineer. Most engineers don\xe2\x80\x99t bother with a PhD. But you may be interested to know I designed the zero-gravity waste-disposal system for NASA.\nMrs Latham: Got it, you\xe2\x80\x99re a space plumber.\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna go hit the bar.\nMrs Latham: Tell me about these two.\nRaj: Do him first.\nSeibert: Dr. Hofstadter is representing our experimental physics program tonight. I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll really enjoy hearing about his fascinating work.\nMrs Latham: Right. Fascinate me.\nLeonard: Uh.. b.. d.. uh.. uh..\nMrs Latham: They\xe2\x80\x99re cute when they\xe2\x80\x99re about to wet themselves, aren\xe2\x80\x99t they? I\xe2\x80\x99ll make it easy for you. When you arrive at the lab in the morning, what sort of machine do you turn on?\nLeonard: Coffee maker?\nMrs Latham: All right, Dr. Kooth\xe2\x80\xa6 uh, whatever it is, you\xe2\x80\x99re up.\nRaj: It\xe2\x80\x99s Koothrappali. I have to tinkle.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: And so, instead of bowing to pressure, and going to that pointless soiree, I stayed right here and did a load of whites.\nAmy (on webcam): Well, normally I respect your macho rebellious attitude toward The Man, but, in this case, I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve made a foolish mistake.\nSheldon: Unlikely. But make your case. Keeping in mind that your critical attitude is ruining our Saturday night together, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not above minimizing your window.\nAmy: Sheldon, like it or not, until you manage to upload your intelligence into a self-sustaining orbiting satellite, equipped with high-speed Internet and a cloaking device, you will be dependent on other members of the human race.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s it. Prepare to be minimized.\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99m not finished. All scientists have to fund-raise, Sheldon. How do you think I paid for my lab?\nI went to Saudi Arabia and met with a prince who had an interest in neurobiology.\nSheldon: Your lab is funded by some Middle-Eastern dilettante?\nAmy: Technically, Faisal is my fiance. But I do have a state-of-the-art two-photon microscope and a place to stay in Riyadh for the winter.\nSheldon: Well, that explains those puzzling camel race photos on your Facebook page.\nAmy: And consider this, without you to make the case for the physics department, the task will fall to people like Leonard and Rajesh.\nSheldon: Are you trying to scare me? \xe2\x80\x98Cause you\xe2\x80\x99re succeeding.\nAmy: Well, then prepare to be terrified. If your friends are unconvincing, this year\xe2\x80\x99s donations might go to, say, the geology department.\nSheldon: Oh, dear,not, not the dirt people!\nAmy: Or worse, it could go to the liberal arts.\nSheldon: No!\nAmy: Millions of dollars being showered on poets, literary theorists and students of gender studies.\nSheldon: Oh, the humanities!\nScene: The party.\nLeonard: On the bright side, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think President Siebert will be making us go to any more fund-raisers.\nHoward: It was so much easier at my bar mitzvah. The old people just came up to you, pinched your cheek and handed you a savings bond.\nRaj: Oh, don\xe2\x80\x99t be such gloomy Gusses. Look at the size of these shrimp! At what point do we start calling them lobsters?\nLeonard: Face it, Raj, we crashed and burned tonight.\nMrs Latham: Oh, you didn\xe2\x80\x99t do that badly.\nLeonard: Mrs. Latham, the first machine I turn on in the morning is the helium-neon laser, \xe2\x80\x99cause it needs to warm up.\nMrs Latham: I no longer care, dear. But don\xe2\x80\x99t worry, I really enjoyed meeting you this evening.\nLeonard: You\xe2\x80\x99re kidding. That was good for you? \xe2\x80\x98Cause I was sweating through my T-shirt.\nMrs Latham: Excellent! There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing I like better than making smart people feel ill at ease.\nLeonard: Why?\nMrs Latham: Oh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, it\xe2\x80\x99s one of the fun things you get to do when you have lots of money. Watch. Hey! Who said you could eat that shrimp? See? Fun.\nSheldon (behind them): No, no, no, I\xe2\x80\x99m just here for your money. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to shake anyone\xe2\x80\x99s germy hands. Explain it to them, Siebert.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon (on phone): I must confess I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand you, President Siebert. First you say you want me to appear at your fund-raisers, but now you say you never want me to go anywhere near your fund-raisers. Forgive me, but that sounds like a mixed message. Here we go again. If there\xe2\x80\x99s simply no talking to me, why did you call? I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, someone\xe2\x80\x99s on the other line. Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you see if you can organize your thoughts, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll try again later. Cooper-Hofstadter residence. Go for Cooper.\nGood morning, Mrs. Latham. Well, yes, of course I remember you. A woman well past her prime seeking to augment her social status by doling out her late husband\xe2\x80\x99s ill-gotten gains. So, how much money are you going to give me? I\xe2\x80\x99m not crazy, my mother had me tested. Well, if you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to give me money, then why are you calling? She wants to talk to you. Who\xe2\x80\x99s crazy now?\nLeonard: Hello, Mrs. Latham. Yes, I live with him. I don\xe2\x80\x99t, I, I really don\xe2\x80\x99t know why. Tonight? Sure, that\xe2\x80\x99d be great. Okay, I\xe2\x80\x99ll, I\xe2\x80\x99ll see you then. Bye. She wants to have dinner and talk about my research.\nSheldon: An entire dinner to talk about your research? Where you going, the drive-thru at Jack in the Box?\nLeonard: Well, wherever we\xe2\x80\x99re going, she\xe2\x80\x99s sending a car to pick me up.\nSheldon: Okay, I see what\xe2\x80\x99s happening.\nLeonard: What?\nSheldon: My stature intimidates her, so she\xe2\x80\x99s using you to get to me. Crafty old gal.\nLeonard: Excuse me, but you are not the only distinguished scientist in this apartment. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been published in peer-reviewed journals, I received a Dissertation of the Year award for experimental particle physics.\nSheldon: No, that can\xe2\x80\x99t be it. And since you seem to have forgotten, the reason we live together is we\xe2\x80\x99re best friends. And I got your back, Jack.\nSecne: Mrs Latham\xe2\x80\x99s car.\nLeonard: That was a great meal.\nMrs Latham: I\xe2\x80\x99m glad you enjoyed it.\nLeonard: The only time I eat this well is when my mom\xe2\x80\x99s in town and she takes me out to dinner.\nMrs Latham: Is that so?\nLeonard: You kind of remind me of her. She enjoys making people uncomfortable, too.\nMrs Latham: Well, you remind me of a boy I dated in college.\nLeonard: No kidding.\nMrs Latham: Sweet boy. Very smart. If only he\xe2\x80\x99d had money.\nLeonard: Yeah, um, so, hey, speaking of money, how are you feeling about helping the physics department get a cryogenic centrifugal pump and molecular sieve?\nMrs Latham: Well, I must say, you make a very persuasive case for it.\nLeonard: Oh, good, good.\nMrs Latham: And I\xe2\x80\x99m seriously considering taking it to the next level.\nLeonard: Terrific. Great. What level is that? (She grabs him and kisses him) Okay, now you don\xe2\x80\x99t remind me of my mom.\nScene: The apartment.\n  Sheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, so, eventually, zombies are going to attack the rehab facility where Sandra Bullock is?\nPenny: Yes, Sheldon. Keep watching.\nSheldon: You know, it\xe2\x80\x99s a shame, all that work she\xe2\x80\x99s doing to get sober, only to be torn apart and eaten alive.\nHoward: Hey. How was dinner?\nLeonard: Swell. I need a drink. Do we have any alcohol?\nSheldon: No. But we have potatoes, I could make you vodka. It\xe2\x80\x99ll take two weeks.\nPenny: Leonard, are you okay?\nLeonard: Um, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure.\nHoward: What\xe2\x80\x99s going on?\nLeonard: Well, Mrs. Latham said she was seriously considering donating money so we could get a cryogenic centrifugal pump.\nSheldon: Oh, wow!\nHoward: Yes!\nLeonard: Then she stuck her tongue down my throat.\nSheldon: Why?\nPenny: Okay, we can\xe2\x80\x99t keep explaining everything. Read that book we got you.\nLeonard: She hit on me.\nHoward: Wait-wait-wait. Are you telling us that old lady wanted to have sex with you in exchange for giving your department millions of dollars?\nLeonard: I think so.\nHoward: You lucky duck.\nPenny: You\xe2\x80\x99re really a broken toy, aren\xe2\x80\x99t you?\nLeonard: I was able to get out of there before anything else happened, but she wants to see me again tomorrow night.\nSheldon: Excellent! What are you planning to wear?\nLeonard: What?\nSheldon: Penny, you\xe2\x80\x99re an expert on trading sexual favours for material gain, walk him through this.\nLeonard: Well, n-no, hold on a second, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to sleep with her.\nSheldon: But we need a cryogenic centrifugal pump.\nLeonard: Well, forget it! It\xe2\x80\x99s not gonna happen.\nSheldon: Well, come now, Leonard, this may be your only chance to make a real contribution to science!\nLeonard: I repeat, not gonna happen.\nPenny: What was all that about me trading sexual favours for material gain?\nSheldon: It was a compliment. I believe in giving credit where credit is due.\nScene: The apartment, the following night.\nSheldon (on phone): Okay, fine. I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell him. Leonard, Mrs. Latham\xe2\x80\x99s car is here for you.\nLeonard: I won\xe2\x80\x99t be too late. I\xe2\x80\x99m just gonna make a final pitch for the funding and then say good night.\nSheldon: Hold on, I have something for you.\nLeonard: What\xe2\x80\x99s this?\nSheldon: Just a few things you may need tonight. There\xe2\x80\x99s, uh, baby oil, condoms and, uh, a little something I procured from the school of pharmacology. They say it is to Viagra as Viagra is to a green M&M.\nLeonard: I am not going to have sex with her.\nSheldon: Maybe this will overcome your reluctance. I went on the Internet and found a photograph of a 25-year-old Mrs. Latham to get your libido humming. Check out those saddle shoes. Rar!\nLeonard: Are you insane? I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to prostitute myself just so we can get some new equipment.\nSheldon: Oh, come on! Why not?\nLeonard: Good night, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Given how much time you spend engaging in pointless self-abuse, you might consider, just this once, using your genitalia to actually accomplish something!\nPenny: He still won\xe2\x80\x99t shag the old lady, huh?\nSheldon: No. But thank you for asking.\nScene: Mrs Latham\xe2\x80\x99s car.\nLeonard: Hey. Hi.\nMrs Latham: Hello, Leonard. I hope you\xe2\x80\x99re hungry.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m very hungry. For food, right?\nMrs Latham: Oh, I made you uncomfortable last night. I\xe2\x80\x99m so sorry.\nLeonard: No, that\xe2\x80\x99s okay.\nMrs Latham: No, it most certainly is not. Leonard, I\xe2\x80\x99m making the donation to your department regardless of what happens between us.\nLeonard: Really?\nMrs Latham: Well, of course. There\xe2\x80\x99s no quid pro quo here. You and your colleagues are doing remarkable research, and you deserve the money.\nLeonard: Oh. Then what was last night about?\nMrs Latham: I took a shot, sue me.\nLeonard: Oh.\nMrs Latham: You\xe2\x80\x99re a very handsome man, Leonard.\nLeonard: Thank you.\nMrs Latham: It was foolish of me to think someone your age might ever be interested in someone like me.\nLeonard: Oh, don\xe2\x80\x99t say that. You\xe2\x80\x99re a very attractive woman.\nMrs Latham: Oh, please.\nLeonard: No, it\xe2\x80\x99s true.\nMrs Latham: Well, aren\xe2\x80\x99t you sweet. Just for the record, you\xe2\x80\x99d remember a night with me for the rest of your life.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m sure I would. But why, why, exactly?\nMrs Latham: You\xe2\x80\x99re a very smart man. How do you think I landed such a rich husband?\nLeonard: I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t really given it much thought.\nMrs Latham: Well, think about it.\nLeonard: Do you mean?\nMrs Latham: Yep. I\xe2\x80\x99m that good.\nLeonard: Oh, what the hell.\nScene: The stairwell. Leonard is returning home looking dishevelled.\nPenny: Good morning, slut.\nLeonard: What?\nPenny: Oh, please, I recognize the walk of shame when I see it. All you\xe2\x80\x99re missing is a little smeared mascara and a purse with panties wadded up in it.\nSheldon: What\xe2\x80\x99s going on?\nLeonard: Oh, nothing\xe2\x80\x99s going on. Excuse me.\nSheldon: Are you just getting home?\nLeonard: Yeah.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s a good sign, right?\nPenny: Oh, yeah.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m so proud of you! You sold yourself out like a common streetwalker!\nLeonard: No, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t do it for the money.\nSheldon: She stiffed you?\nPenny: I believe that\xe2\x80\x99s what your roommate did to her.\nSheldon: What?\nPenny: Again, read the book we gave you.\nLeonard: No, I mean, I, I, I got the money first.\nSheldon: Smart. Get paid up front. Yeah, I think you have a real knack for gigolo work, Leonard.\nLeonard: Uh, I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna go lie down.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s a good idea, get your rest. There are a lot more rich old ladies out there, and Daddy needs a new linear accelerator. And I thought he didn\xe2\x80\x99t learn anything from his relationship with you.\nPenny: Hey!\nSheldon: Another compliment! Learn to recognize them.\nScene: The cafeteria.\nSeibert: Ah, there he is! The man of the hour! He took one for the team!\nLeonard: I didn\xe2\x80\x99t do it for the money!\nSeibert: Keep telling yourself that, it makes it easier. Trust me, I know.\nRaj: Cool, buddy! That\xe2\x80\x99s awesome!\nHoward: How was she?\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
