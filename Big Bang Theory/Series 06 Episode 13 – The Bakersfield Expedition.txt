b'Scene: The apartment. Sheldon is steaming a Star Trek uniform.\nLeonard: Hey, will you steam my uniform next?\nSheldon: Interesting. Do you recall this conversation? Leonard, want to go halfsies on a steamer? No, Sheldon, we don\xe2\x80\x99t need a steamer. Looks like that rumpled chicken\xe2\x80\x99s come home to roost.\nPenny: Hi. Here are the make-up sponges you asked for.\nLeonard: Oh, thanks, I thought I had more.\nPenny: Damn, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got more makeup than I do. You\xe2\x80\x99ve got better makeup than I do. Yeah, I\xe2\x80\x99m borrowing this.\nLeonard: Hey, hey, hey, hey. This is my Comic-Con makeup. I love you, but there are some things a man doesn\xe2\x80\x99t share with his girlfriend.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s a wise policy. I once borrowed my sister\xe2\x80\x99s makeup for a costume contest. Got a terrible case of pinkeye. But luckily, I was going as a zombie. I won second place.\nPenny: I feel like you guys just went to Comic-Con.\nLeonard: That was San Diego Comic-Con. This is Bakersfield Comic-Con.\nPenny: Is that better?\nLeonard: Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s a lot smaller. It\xe2\x80\x99s more about the comic books. The way these conventions used to be before they went all Hollywood.\nSheldon: So to answer your question, no, it\xe2\x80\x99s not better.\nPenny: Well, then why are you going?\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s a comic book convention. You know, it\xe2\x80\x99s like pizza or particle accelerators, even the stinky one\xe2\x80\x99s still pretty good.\nPenny: All right. Well, you guys have fun. I guess I\xe2\x80\x99ll see you Sunday night.\nLeonard: Yeah.\nPenny: Okay.\nLeonard: Oh, hang on a second. (Hands her the day\xe2\x80\x99s newspaper) Hold this. (Photographs the two of them together)\nPenny: What was that for?\nLeonard: To show people when they don\xe2\x80\x99t believe me.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: A restaurant.\nPenny: Oh, this is the best. You have booze with breakfast on a Tuesday, you got a problem. You do it on the weekend, you got brunch.\nAmy: Sheldon doesn\xe2\x80\x99t believe in brunch. He can\xe2\x80\x99t stand being at a table where one person\xe2\x80\x99s having an omelette and another person\xe2\x80\x99s having a sandwich.\nBernadette: He\xe2\x80\x99s not exhausting at all.\nPenny (receiving text): Oh. It\xe2\x80\x99s Leonard. He says they\xe2\x80\x99re on the road and headed for Bakersfield at warp speed. Maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s the mimosa, but I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna give the kid an LOL.\nBernadette: It\xe2\x80\x99s cute how excited they are. You should have seen Howard sewing his costume all week for the convention.\nAmy: When did Howard learn to sew?\nBernadette: When he was a little boy, every couple months, he would have to let his mom\xe2\x80\x99s pants out.\nAmy: I don\xe2\x80\x99t even understand why they go to these conventions.\nPenny: I know. The four of them work at a major university. They\xe2\x80\x99re all super smart. How can they still be into something made for 12-year-olds?\nBernadette: I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind it. I think Howie\xe2\x80\x99s just in touch with his inner child. Although when he comes to bed in his Batman pyjamas, sometimes it feels like I\xe2\x80\x99m touching his inner child.\nAmy: It\xe2\x80\x99s probably because they were bullied growing up. In a world where you can\xe2\x80\x99t fight back, superheroes provide meaningful wish-fulfillment.\nPenny: Mmmm. Now I feel bad for picking on all those kids. Although, in my defence, if Danny Biffle didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to eat a mouthful of dirt, he shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have shown up to school wearing a bow tie.\nBernadette: I\xe2\x80\x99ve never even read a comic book. You guys?\nPenny: Uh-uh.\nAmy: No.\nBernadette: I mean, it\xe2\x80\x99s such an important part of their lives. Maybe we should try reading some.\nAmy: Seriously?\nBernadette: The comic book store isn\xe2\x80\x99t far from here.\nPenny: That is an amazing idea. Okay, how many of these have I had?\nScene: Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s car.\nSheldon: I think you should turn on the GPS.\nLeonard: It is on.\nSheldon: But the turn-by-turn voice option isn\xe2\x80\x99t on. I know I\xe2\x80\x99d feel more safe if you turn on the turn-by-turn voice option. I love the turn-by-turn voice option.\nHoward: Has it really only been ten miles?\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m turning it on, but just to shut you up.\nGPS (in Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s voice): Leonard, bear left and continue on Interstate 210.\nSheldon: Ooh, sounds like that fellow knows what he\xe2\x80\x99s talking about. I\xe2\x80\x99d put on my listening ears if I were you.\nLeonard: What did you do?\nSheldon: I found a hack online. I was able to upload MP3 recordings of my voice to your GPS.\nRaj: That is so cool.\nLeonard: Counterpoint, no, it\xe2\x80\x99s not.\nGPS: Continue on Interstate 210 for five miles. Here\xe2\x80\x99s an interesting fact about interstates.\nLeonard: Really?\nSheldon: Shh, he said it\xe2\x80\x99s interesting.\nGPS: Interstates are numbered as follows. Even-numbered routes run east and west, odd-numbered routes run north and south. Three-digit route numbers indicate bypasses or spurs.\nHoward: Look, Leonard, there\xe2\x80\x99s a bridge. Drive off it.\nRaj: You know, we\xe2\x80\x99re not that far from Vazquez Rocks.\nSheldon: Oh, they shot a lot of Star Trek episodes out there.\nHoward: We\xe2\x80\x99ve got our costumes in the trunk. We could go there and have a little photo shoot.\nRaj: Great idea. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t had a carbohydrate in two weeks. These cheekbones need to be in front of a camera before I eat a pretzel and they\xe2\x80\x99re gone.\nLeonard: Yeah, that sounds fun.\nSheldon: Oh, smashing. Now, Leonard, do you know how to get there?\nLeonard: No.\nSheldon: Yeah, well luckily, someone in the car does.\nGPS: Recalculating. While we\xe2\x80\x99re waiting, do you know which president signed the Intestate Highway System Act into law? The answer, coming up in 14 miles.\nSheldon: None of you will get it. It\xe2\x80\x99s Eisenhower.\nScene: The comic book store.\nBernadette: Why are they staring?\nAmy: Who cares? Just soak it in. Hello, boys.\nStuart: Oh, hey. Could you please stop staring? They\xe2\x80\x99re just girls. It\xe2\x80\x99s nothing you haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen in movies or in drawings.\nPenny: Hey, Stuart.\nStuart: What brings you guys here?\nBernadette: We were looking for a recommendation about comic books.\nStuart: Oh, well, I recommend you don\xe2\x80\x99t open a store and sell them.\nPenny: No, we were just wondering why the guys like this stuff so much, so we thought we\xe2\x80\x99d give it a try.\nStuart: Oh, okay. What do you think you might be into? Superhero, fantasy, graphic novels, manga\xe2\x80\xa6 I swear I will turn a hose on you.\nBernadette: What kind of comics do the guys like?\nStuart: Um, a little bit of everything. Mostly superhero stuff.\nAmy: All right, well, who\xe2\x80\x99s the best superhero?\nStuart: Shh! You can\xe2\x80\x99t ask a question like that in here. Are you trying to start a rumble?\nPenny: Well then, what do you recommend?\nStuart: Well, uh, let\xe2\x80\x99s see. You\xe2\x80\x99ve got your basic clean-cut good guys, Superman, Spider-Man, Captain America. Then you have your darker anti-heroes, your Batman, your Wolverine, Punisher.\nAmy: Ooh, I do love a bad boy.\nPenny: As evidenced by your boyfriend and his fear of hamsters.\nStuart: If I were you, I\xe2\x80\x99d go for Fables number one. The artwork is sophisticated, it\xe2\x80\x99s intelligently written, and it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t objectify or stereotype women.\nPenny: Ooh, Thor! He\xe2\x80\x99s hot.\nStuart: Yeah, he kind of is.\nScene: Vasquez Rocks. Sheldon, dressed as Data, is having his makeup put on by Raj, dressed as Worf.\nRaj: And we\xe2\x80\x99re blending, and we\xe2\x80\x99re blending, and we\xe2\x80\x99re done.\nSheldon: I know Mr. Data isn\xe2\x80\x99t supposed to smile, but here it comes.\nHoward (dressed as a Borg): Come on, guys. Let\xe2\x80\x99s do this.\nLeonard (dressed as Captain Picard): Yeah, I\xe2\x80\x99m sweating my bald cap off.\nHoward: So what\xe2\x80\x99s our first pose going to be?\nRaj: I say we begin with a classic Star Trek fight scene.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99ll set the timer.\nHoward: Sheldon, how is that a fight pose?\nSheldon: Mr. Data\xe2\x80\x99s weapon is his mind. I\xe2\x80\x99m wielding it.\nRaj: Phasers on the Borg! Charlie\xe2\x80\x99s Angels.\nHoward: Okay, what\xe2\x80\x99s next?\nRaj: Now let\xe2\x80\x99s do some sexy glamour shots. I\xe2\x80\x99ll set the mood. (Rhythmically) Oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, Yeah, nice one, oontz, oontz. That\xe2\x80\x99s right. Oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz\xe2\x80\xa6\nHoward: Oh, my God. Leonard, someone\xe2\x80\x99s stealing your car!\nLeonard: What? Hey, hey! Come back here!\nRaj: Stop!\nSheldon: Stealing is against the law!\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe this.\nHoward: Son of a bitch.\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99ll call 911. What, oh, no, my phone is in my other pants.\nHoward: Oh, so is mine.\nLeonard: Mine, too. Anybody got any ideas?\nSheldon: Nope. The only thing left to do now is assign blame. (To Raj) Nice going.\nScene: The side of the road.\nLeonard: What kind of a person steals another person\xe2\x80\x99s car in broad daylight?\nSheldon: What kind of person leaves his keys in the car?\nLeonard: I thought we agreed this was all Koothrappali\xe2\x80\x99s fault.\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re right. Nice going.\nHoward: Car.\nRaj: What is wrong with people? Why don\xe2\x80\x99t they stop?\nSheldon: Maybe we\xe2\x80\x99re better off. What if we were to get in a car with a crazy person?\nLeonard: Look at us, Sheldon. We\xe2\x80\x99re the crazy people.\nSheldon: Well, perhaps we should hold up a sign that assures passing motorists of our mental competence.\nHoward: Good idea. Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you get started on that?\nLeonard: Come on, let\xe2\x80\x99s just start walking. There\xe2\x80\x99s got to be a gas station or something nearby.\nSheldon: What, you think just because you\xe2\x80\x99re wearing a captain\xe2\x80\x99s uniform, you\xe2\x80\x99re in charge?\nLeonard: Yes.\nSheldon: All right.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nPenny: Hmm, okay, I\xe2\x80\x99m done. How did you guys finish so fast?\nBernadette: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, there were a lot of pictures, and one page only had the word brakkadoom!\nPenny: Yeah, well, I have street smarts.\nBernadette: So, what\xe2\x80\x99d you guys think?\nAmy: Well, there was a lot of action.\nPenny: Mmm.\nAmy: And the story moved along at a brisk pace. It was, overall, what\xe2\x80\x99s the word I\xe2\x80\x99m looking for?\nPenny: Stupid?\nAmy: So stupid.\nPenny: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how Leonard can get so caught up in this.\nBernadette: It\xe2\x80\x99s crazy, they spend hours arguing about things that don\xe2\x80\x99t even exist.\nAmy: What a waste of time.\nPenny: I know. A hammer so heavy that no one else can pick it up?\nBernadette: I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s heavy. It\xe2\x80\x99s some sort of magic, so only Thor can lift it.\nPenny: That makes even less sense, I mean\xe2\x80\xa6\nAmy: No, no, no, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t. Thor is a god. The hammer is his, only he can use it. It\xe2\x80\x99s like Sheldon and his toothbrush. Or his thin, beckoning lips.\nPenny: Okay, hang on, what if Thor\xe2\x80\x99s hand is on the hammer? I mean, if he\xe2\x80\x99s touching it with his god magic, does that mean I could lift it?\nBernadette: No.\nAmy: Yes.\nPenny: Well, which is it?\nAmy: Maybe we missed something.\nBernadette: Let\xe2\x80\x99s read it again.\nPenny: Okay.\nAmy: Yeah.\nBernadette: You want some tea?\nAmy: Good idea. I\xe2\x80\x99ll help you.\nPenny: Wait, I thought we were reading.\nAmy: We are. We\xe2\x80\x99re just, uh, giving you a head start.\nScene: The desert.\nHoward: I wish my mom was here. We could all hang out in her shadow.\nRaj: Wool pants in the desert. I feel like I\xe2\x80\x99ve got poached testicles.\nLeonard: Oh, you poor thing, you\xe2\x80\x99re sweating. That\xe2\x80\x99s so much worse than having your car stolen.\nRaj: Insurance is gonna buy you a new car. It\xe2\x80\x99s not gonna de-funk my junk.\nSheldon: Gentlemen, a little less bellyaching. We\xe2\x80\x99re Starfleet officers and a member of the Borg Collective.\nLeonard: Please, Sheldon, I am so not in the mood.\nSheldon: Leonard, all our lives we have dreamed of finding ourselves inside one of the fantasy worlds we love. And look at us. At this moment, we are, in fact, a Star Trek landing party stranded in an alien and unforgiving environment, relying only on our wits, our fortitude and our moxie. As long as we have those things, nothing can stop\xe2\x80\xa6\nGuys in Passing Car (throwing a drink over Sheldon): Nerds!\nSheldon: I hate this planet.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s Apartment.\nAmy: It says right here on the hammer, whoever holds this hammer, if he be worthy, shall possess the power of Thor.\nBernadette: Hold on, who decides who\xe2\x80\x99s worthy? Does the hammer decide?\nPenny: Yes!\nAmy: No! It can\xe2\x80\x99t decide. It\xe2\x80\x99s a hammer.\nPenny: You said it\xe2\x80\x99s a magic hammer.\nAmy: Yeah, but, it can\xe2\x80\x99t make decisions.\nPenny: If Harry Potter\xe2\x80\x99s wand can make decisions, why can\xe2\x80\x99t Thor\xe2\x80\x99s hammer?\nAmy: Okay, if you\xe2\x80\x99re going to start comparing wands and hammers, I can\xe2\x80\x99t even take you seriously.\nScene: A diner.\nSheldon: Hello. Hello. Uh, uh, uh, four glasses of water, please. Anything for you guys?\nLeonard: Can I use your phone? Our car got stolen.\nWaitress: Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you ask Scotty to beam you up?\nSheldon: Scotty was on the original series, and we\xe2\x80\x99re Next Generation. So, joke\xe2\x80\x99s on you.\nHoward: We\xe2\x80\x99re not with him.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nAmy: You can\xe2\x80\x99t pick something up in outer space. In space, there is no up.\nPenny: Oh, yeah? Then how does the sun come up every day?\nAmy: Hard to argue with those kind of street smarts.\nBernadette: Leonard and Sheldon have boxes of comics across the hall. Why don\xe2\x80\x99t we go look at those?\nPenny: Oh, great. Yes. And then you will see, I am not wrong, because if we were in outer space, then anyone could pick up the hammer because it would be floating around in a weightless environment. Yeah, that\xe2\x80\x99s right, the slow reader used science. Suck on that.\nScene: The diner.\nPoliceman: Was there anything valuable in the car?\nLeonard: Our clothes, our wallets, phones.\nRaj: And about three hundred dollars worth of makeup, so this thief could look like anyone right now.\nPoliceman: Makeup? Sure.\nLeonard: Uh, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to the Comic-Con in Bakersfield. They have a big costume contest. It\xe2\x80\x99s cooler than it sounds.\nPoliceman: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, sounds pretty cool.\nRaj: It, it is. It\xe2\x80\x99s not just comic books. They\xe2\x80\x99ve got action figures, toys, a Tron-themed dance party.\nLeonard: Okay, he gets how cool it is.\nPoliceman: I think I have all I need here. You guys need me to call someone? I\xe2\x80\x99m guessing your moms?\nLeonard: Thanks, but we\xe2\x80\x99ve got it covered.\nHoward: Okay, I just talked to my mom. She arranged for us to get a rental car.\nRaj: Great. We can still make it to Comic-Con.\nLeonard: Are you kidding me? After all we\xe2\x80\x99ve been through, I just want to go home.\nRaj: Don\xe2\x80\x99t be like that. Come on, Howard, talk to him.\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m with Leonard. I\xe2\x80\x99m done.\nRaj: Fine, then I guess it\xe2\x80\x99s two against two. How do we decide?\nSheldon: Actually, it\xe2\x80\x99s three against one.\nRaj: What? What about the mission? You said we were a real-life landing party.\nSheldon: Yeah, well, we\xe2\x80\x99re not. We\xe2\x80\x99re an imaginary landing party who had real-life garbage thrown at us by real-life strangers who think we\xe2\x80\x99re idiots. And to tell you the truth, I\xe2\x80\x99m starting to feel like one. I want to go home now.\nRaj: Okay. Did we at least rent the car from Enterprise? Get it? Enterprise? Screw you. That\xe2\x80\x99s funny.\nScene: The apartment.\nBernadette: Well, what if the Hulk picked up Thor while Thor is holding the hammer?\nAmy: Yeah?\nBernadette: Then by the transitive property of picking things up, Hulk picked up the hammer.\nAmy: No. Hulk picked up Thor, Thor picked up the hammer.\nPenny: Okay, hang on. If I go to a bar and pick up a guy, and he picks up a girl, and then we all leave together, did I pick up the girl?\nAmy: Did that ever happen?\nPenny: Hey, are we talking about me or are we talking about Thor?\nScene: The stairwell.\nSheldon: Well, I say that\xe2\x80\x99s the last time we ever go outside.\nAmy (off): Look, right here. Red Hulk is picking up Thor\xe2\x80\x99s hammer \xe2\x80\x99cause Thor\xe2\x80\x99s touching it.\nPenny (off): No, it\xe2\x80\x99s because they\xe2\x80\x99re in space. He\xe2\x80\x99s really just touching the strap.\nAmy(off): The strap is part of the hammer.\nBernadette (off): No, it\xe2\x80\x99s not!\nRaj: Are they actually arguing about comic books?\nLeonard: No, that can\xe2\x80\x99t be right.\nHoward: Maybe Thor\xe2\x80\x99s Hammer is a new colour of nail polish.\nBernadette (off): Then Red Hulk must be worthy.\nPenny (off): How could Red Hulk be worthy?\nBernadette (off): You don\xe2\x80\x99t know his life.\nSheldon: There\xe2\x80\x99s only one logical explanation. Somewhere in the desert we crossed into an alternate dimension where the women in our lives can finally appreciate great literature.\nRaj: If it\xe2\x80\x99s an alternate dimension, sounds like a job for a landing party.\nSheldon: Captain, what are your orders?\nLeonard: I say we investigate.\nSheldon: Wait. They might be hostile.\nLeonard: Fine, but set them to stun. If we vaporize Penny, I\xe2\x80\x99ll never find a girlfriend that pretty again.\nScene: Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s car.\nGPS: Fun fact, President Eisenhower signed the Federal Aid Highway Act from his hospital room.\nFirst Car Thief: Wow, that is interesting.\nSecond Car Thief: You learn something new every day.\nGPS: Say, can you name the four state capitols that are not served by the interstate system?\nFirst Car Thief: Ooh, another quiz.\nSecond Car Thief: Yes!\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
