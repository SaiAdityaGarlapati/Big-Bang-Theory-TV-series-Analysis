b'Scene: Opening shows some scenes from the final episode of the previous season, followed by the caption \xe2\x80\x9cThree months later.\xe2\x80\x9d Scene then opens in lobby, with the guys arriving home from the North Pole. All have long hair and bushy beards except Sheldon, whose hair is slightly longer and who has a goatee.\nLeonard: Oh, thank God we\xe2\x80\x99re home.\nHoward: I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe we spent three months in that frozen hell.\nRaj: It was like a snowy nightmare from which there was no awakening.\nSheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what Arctic expedition you guys were on, but I thought it was a hoot and a half.\nScene: The apartment door. Sheldon is on the phone.\nSheldon: Oh, hi mom. No, I told you I\xe2\x80\x99d call you when I got home, I\xe2\x80\x99m not home yet. (Walks through door) Alright, I\xe2\x80\x99m home. The Arctic expedition was a remarkable success, I\xe2\x80\x99m all but certain there\xe2\x80\x99s a Nobel Prize in my future. Actually, I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say that. I\xe2\x80\x99m entirely certain. No, mother, I could not feel your church group praying for my safety. The fact that I\xe2\x80\x99m home safe is not proof that it worked, that logic is Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc. No, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sassing you in Eskimo talk.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m going to go let Penny know we\xe2\x80\x99re back.\nSheldon: Mother, I have to go. Yeah, love you. Bye. (To his spot) Hello, old friend. (Sits) Daddy\xe2\x80\x99s home.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s door.\nPenny: Leonard, you\xe2\x80\x99re back.\nLeonard: Yeah, I just stopped by to say\xe2\x80\xa6 (she grabs him and kisses him) Yeah, so, hi!\nPenny: Hi! (They stumble, kissing, into her apartment and slam the door shut)\nHoward: Dammit, I should have gone over and told her we were back.\nRaj: Yeah, it was first come, first served.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: A moment later.\nSheldon: I just want you both to know, when I publish my findings, I won\xe2\x80\x99t forget your contributions.\nHoward: Great.\nRaj: Thanks.\nSheldon: Of course, I can\xe2\x80\x99t mention you in my Nobel acceptance speech, but when I get round to writing my memoirs you can expect a very effusive footnote, and perhaps a signed copy.\nRaj: We have to tell him.\nSheldon: Tell me what?\nHoward: Damn his Vulcan hearing.\nSheldon: You fellows are planning a party for me, aren\xe2\x80\x99t you?\nHoward: Okay, Sheldon, sit down.\nSheldon: If there\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a theme, I should let you know that I don\xe2\x80\x99t care for luau, toga or under the sea.\nHoward: Yeah, we\xe2\x80\x99ll keep that in mind, look, we need to talk to you about something that happened at the North Pole.\nSheldon: If this is about the night the heat went out, there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to be embarrassed about.\nRaj: It\xe2\x80\x99s not about that.\nHoward: And we agreed to never speak of it again.\nSheldon: So we slept together naked. It was only to keep our core body temperatures from plummeting.\nHoward: He\xe2\x80\x99s speaking about it.\nRaj: For me, it was a bonding moment.\nHoward: Sheldon, you remember the first few weeks we were looking for magnetic monopoles and not finding anything and you were acting like an obnoxious, giant dictator?\nRaj: I thought we were going to be gentle with him.\nHoward: That\xe2\x80\x99s why I added the tator. And then when we found our first positive data, you were so happy.\nSheldon: Oh, yes. In the world of emoticons, I was colon, capital D.\nHoward: Well, in actuality, what your equipment detected wasn\xe2\x80\x99t so much evidence of paradigm-shifting monopoles as it was\xe2\x80\xa6 static from the electric can opener we were turning on and off.\nRaj: He just went colon, capital O.\nSheldon: You tampered with my experiment?\nHoward: We had to.\nRaj: It was the only way to keep you from being such a huge Dickensian. You see that? I added the ensian.\nSheldon: Did Leonard know about this? Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s my best friend in the world. Surely Leonard didn\xe2\x80\x99t know.\nHoward: Actually, it was his idea.\nSheldon: Of course it was. The whole plan reeks of Leonard.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nPenny: I missed you so much.\nLeonard: I missed you, too.\nPenny: I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t even think of anyone else while you were gone.\nLeonard: Me, neither. Except for one night when the heat went out. Long story, it\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\xa6 don\xe2\x80\x99t ask.\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard. (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard. (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard.\nLeonard (whispering): Do not make a sound.\nSheldon: Whispering do not make a sound is a sound.\nLeonard: Damn his Vulcan hearing. Not a good time, Sheldon.\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny.\nPenny: Oh, this is ridiculous. What?\nSheldon: Hello, Penny. I realize you\xe2\x80\x99re currently at the mercy of your primitive biological urges, but as you have an entire lifetime of poor decisions ahead of you, may I interrupt this one?\nPenny: It\xe2\x80\x99s great to see you too. Come on in.\nSheldon: Wolowitz has informed me of your grand deception. Do you have anything to say for yourself?\nLeonard: Yes, I feel terrible about it. I will never forgive myself, I don\xe2\x80\x99t expect you to either, and I would really appreciate it if you would leave me with Penny for a session of self-criticism and repentance.\nPenny: Okay, can someone please tell me what\xe2\x80\x99s going on here?\nSheldon: What\xe2\x80\x99s going on is I was led to believe I was making groundbreaking strides in science, when in fact, I was being fed false data at the hands of Wolowitz, Koothrappali and your furry little boy toy.\nPenny: Is that true?\nLeonard: It was the only way to make him happy.\nPenny: Why did you have to make him happy?\nLeonard: Because when he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t happy, we wanted to kill him. There was even a plan. We were going to throw his Kindle outside, and when he went to get it, lock the door and let him freeze to death.\nSheldon: That seems like a bit of an overreaction.\nLeonard: No, the overreaction was the plan to tie your limbs to four different sled dog teams and yell mush. Look, we kept the original data. You can still publish the actual results.\nSheldon: Yes, but the actual results are unsuccessful and I\xe2\x80\x99ve already sent an e-mail to everyone at the university explaining that I have confirmed string theory and forever changed man\xe2\x80\x99s understanding of the universe.\nLeonard: Aw, see, yeah, you probably shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have done that. So write another e-mail, set the record straight, it\xe2\x80\x99s no big deal.\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re right, Leonard, it\xe2\x80\x99s not a big deal. All you did was lie to me destroy my dream and humiliate me in front of the whole university. That, FYI, was sarcasm. I, in fact, believe it is a big deal\nPenny: Oh, the poor thing.\nLeonard: Yeah, I feel terrible.\nPenny: Wait, wait. Aren\xe2\x80\x99t you going to go talk to him?\nLeonard: What? Uh, he\xe2\x80\x99ll be fine, the guy\xe2\x80\x99s a trouper, come here.\nPenny: No, you\xe2\x80\x99re right, you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t talk to him. I will.\nLeonard: Man, I cannot catch a break.\nScene: Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom. Penny knocks and enters.\nPenny: Hey. Do you want to talk?\nSheldon: About what? Being betrayed by my friends? Spending three months at the North Pole for nothing? And I didn\xe2\x80\x99t even get to go to Comic-Con!\nPenny: Oh, hon\xe2\x80\xa6 Uh\xe2\x80\xa6 (singing) Soft kitty, warm kitty\xe2\x80\xa6\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s for when I\xe2\x80\x99m sick. Sad is not sick.\nPenny: Oh. Sorry. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know your sad song.\nSheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a sad song. I\xe2\x80\x99m not a child.\nPenny: Well, you know, I do understand what you\xe2\x80\x99re going through.\nSheldon: Really? Did you just have the Nobel Prize in waitressing stolen from you?\nPenny: Well, no, but when I was a senior in high school, one of my friends heard I was going to be named head cheerleader. Oh, I was so excited. My mom even made me a celebration pie. Then they named stupid Valerie Mossbacher head cheerleader. Big ol\xe2\x80\x99 slutbag.\nSheldon: Are you saying that you think a celebration pie is even remotely comparable to a Nobel Prize?\nPenny: Well, they\xe2\x80\x99re pretty tasty.\nSheldon: And on a different, but not unrelated topic, based on your current efforts to buoy my spirits, do you truly believe that you were ever fit to be a cheer leader?\nPenny: Look, Sheldon, I just don\xe2\x80\x99t think that the guys and Leonard really meant to hurt you. You know? They just told an unfortunate lie to deal with a difficult situation. Okay, you know what it\xe2\x80\x99s like? Remember that scene in the new Star Trek movie when Kirk has to take over the ship, so he tells Spock all that stuff he knew wasn\xe2\x80\x99t true, like saying Spock didn\xe2\x80\x99t care his mom died?\nSheldon: I missed Comic-Con and the new Star Trek movie!\nScene: The university cafeteria. The guys have shaved and had haircuts. Howard has kept his moustache.\nRaj: I like the new look.\nHoward: Thanks. I call it the Clooney.\nRaj: I call it the Mario and Luigi, but whatever. Hey, how\xe2\x80\x99s Sheldon doing?\nLeonard: Well, he came out of his room this morning wearing his Darth Vader helmet and tried to choke me to death with the Force, so I\xe2\x80\x99d say, a little better.\nHoward: If I may abruptly change the subject, did you and Penny finally\xe2\x80\xa6 you know.\nLeonard: Howard\xe2\x80\xa6\nHoward: Personally, I don\xe2\x80\x99t care, but my genitals wanted me to ask.\nLeonard: Well, tell your genitals what I do with Penny is none of their business.\nHoward (to his genitals): He says they didn\xe2\x80\x99t do it.\nLeonard (to Sheldon, entering): Sheldon, over here. (Sheldon sits at another table and tries to choke all three to death with the force. Raj pretends he is choking.)\nHoward: What are you doing?\nRaj: I feel bad for the guy.\nLeonard: Sheldon, why are you sitting by yourself?\nSheldon: Because I am without friends. Like the proverbial cheese, I stand alone. Even while seated.\nLeonard: Come on. We said we were sorry.\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s going to take more than I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry and a store-bought apology pie from Penny to make up for what you\xe2\x80\x99ve done to me.\nKripke (arriving): Hey, Cooper. Wead your wetwaction e-mail. Way to destroy your weputation.\nSheldon: You see? People have been pointing and laughing at me all morning.\nKripke: That\xe2\x80\x99s not twue. People have been pointing and waughing at you your whole wife.\nSheldon: All right, I\xe2\x80\x99ve had enough. Attention, everyone. I\xe2\x80\x99 m Dr. Sheldon Cooper. As many of you in the physics department might know, my career trajectory has taken a minor detour.\nKripke: Off a cwiff.\nSheldon: My credibility may have been damaged\xe2\x80\xa6\nKripke: Compwetely wecked.\nSheldon: But I would like to remind you that in science, there\xe2\x80\x99s no such thing as failure. There once was a man who referred to his prediction of a cosmological constant as the single biggest blunder of his career. That man\xe2\x80\x99s name was, surprise, surprise, Albert Einstein.\nKripke: Yeah, but wesearch into Dark Energy pwoved that Einstein\xe2\x80\x99s cosmowogical constant was actually wight all along, so you\xe2\x80\x99re still, surpwise, surpwise, a woser.\nSheldon: Oh, you think you\xe2\x80\x99re so clever. Well, let me just tell you, while I do not currently have a scathing retort, you check your e-mail periodically for a doozy.\nLeonard: So much for our friendship with Sheldon.\nRaj: Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ll always have the night the heat went out.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nPenny: Hi.\nLeonard: Hey. Listen, since we got, you know, interrupted last night, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t have a chance to give you this.\nPenny: Oh, Leonard, you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have. Oh, boy! What is it?\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s a snowflake. From the North Pole.\nPenny: Are you serious?\nLeonard: Uh-huh. It\xe2\x80\x99ll last forever. I preserved it in a one percent solution of polyvinyl acetal resin.\nPenny: Oh, my God. That\xe2\x80\x99s the most romantic thing anyone\xe2\x80\x99s ever said to me that I didn\xe2\x80\x99t understand.\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s actually a pretty simple process. You see, cyanoacrylate are monomers which polymerize on\xe2\x80\xa6 (she kisses him)\nHoward (arriving): Red alert, Leonard. Sheldon ran away.\nLeonard: Man, I can not catch a break.\nPenny: So, how do you know he ran away?\nHoward: Well, he\xe2\x80\x99s not answering his phone, he handed in his resignation at the university and he sent me a text that said, I\xe2\x80\x99m running away.\nLeonard: Okay, well, thanks for letting me know.\nPenny: Well, Leonard, aren\xe2\x80\x99t you going to do something?\nLeonard: Of course I\xe2\x80\x99m going to do something. Uh, Howard, you check the comic book store. Raj, go to the Thai restaurant. I\xe2\x80\x99ll stay here with Penny in her apartment. (His phone rings) Oh, damn it. It\xe2\x80\x99s Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s mother. A break cannot be caught. Hi, Mrs. Cooper. He is? Sheldon went home to Texas. Yeah, no, I know he resigned. Yes, I guess it kind of is our fault. No, no, no, you, you\xe2\x80\x99re right, someone needs to come talk to him. Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry, I\xe2\x80\x99ll take care of it. Yeah. All right. New plan. Howard, you and Raj go to Texas. I\xe2\x80\x99ll stay here with Penny in her apartment.\nPenny: Well, you\xe2\x80\x99re not gonna go with them?\nLeonard: Well, you know, I gave you the snowflake and we were kissing and\xe2\x80\xa6 Oh, come on, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to go to Texas!\nHoward: Oh, right, and I do? My people already crossed a desert once, we\xe2\x80\x99re done.\nLeonard: Trust me, you\xe2\x80\x99ll be fine. See ya.\nPenny: Well, wait a second, Leonard, come on, how can you not go? He\xe2\x80\x99s your best friend.\nLeonard: Yeah, but I already saw him naked. Just come here.\nPenny: No. I promise I will be here when you get back. Just go help Sheldon.\nLeonard: Really?\nPenny: Yeah. We waited a few months. We can wait a few more days.\nLeonard: Maybe you can.\nPenny: Go.\nRaj: Boy, you cannot catch a break, can you?\nScene: Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s mother\xe2\x80\x99s kitchen.\n  Mrs Cooper: Here you go, Shelly.\nSheldon: Thanks, Mom.\nMrs Cooper: Hold your horses, young man. Here in Texas, we pray before we eat.\nSheldon: Aw, Mom.\nMrs Cooper: This is not California, land of the heathen. Gimme. By His hand we are all\xe2\x80\xa6\nSheldon: Fed.\nMrs Cooper: Give us, Lord, our daily\xe2\x80\xa6\nSheldon: Bread.\nMrs Cooper: Please know that we are truly\xe2\x80\xa6\nSheldon: Grateful.\nMrs Cooper: For every cup and every\xe2\x80\xa6\nSheldon: Plateful.\nMrs Cooper: Amen. Now, that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t so hard, was it?\nSheldon: My objection was based on considerations other than difficulty.\nMrs Cooper: Whatever. Jesus still loves you.\nSheldon: Thank you for carving a smiley face in my grilled cheese sandwich.\nMrs Cooper: Oh, I know how to take care of my baby. His eyes came out a little thin, but you can just pretend he\xe2\x80\x99s Chinese. So, do you want to talk about what happened with you and your little friends?\nSheldon: They\xe2\x80\x99re not my friends.\nMrs Cooper: All right. If you recall, when you were little, we sat right here at this very spot and we talked about some of the problems you had getting along with the neighbour kids.\nSheldon: That was different. They were threatened by my intelligence and too stupid to know that\xe2\x80\x99s why they hated me.\nMrs Cooper: Oh baby, they knew very well why they hated you.\nScene: A rental car.\n  Leonard: I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe you bought a red cowboy hat.\nHoward: Hello? I\xe2\x80\x99m wearing a red turtleneck. Plus, it was the only boys\xe2\x80\x99 large they had.\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, this does not look like Texas. Where\xe2\x80\x99s the tumbleweeds? Where\xe2\x80\x99s the saloons?\nLeonard: Saloons?\nRaj: Yeah, like in the movies I saw growing up in India. You know, uh, Four for Texas, Yellow Rose of Texas.\nHoward: This neighbourhood is more Texas Chainsaw Massacre.\nRaj: I was really hoping to see a cattle drive.\nLeonard: What can I tell you? They probably have steaks on sale at that big-ass Costco over there.\nScene: Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s mother\xe2\x80\x99s house.\nLeonard: Will you please take that stupid hat off?\nHoward: No, I want to blend in.\nRaj: To what? Toy Story?\nMrs Cooper: Hi, boys.\nHoward: Howdy, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\nMrs Cooper: Howdy to you, too. You got here quick.\nLeonard: \xe2\x80\x93 We took the red-eye.\nMrs Cooper: Well, come on in.\nHoward: Thank you kindly.\nMrs Cooper: Can I\xe2\x80\xa6 Can I get you something to drink?\nLeonard: Uh, no, thank you.\nHoward: If y\xe2\x80\x99all don\xe2\x80\x99t mind, I got a hankerin\xe2\x80\x99 for a Lone Star beer.\nMrs Cooper: There\xe2\x80\x99s no alcohol in this household. Stop talking like that and lose the hat.\nHoward: Sorry. I\xe2\x80\x99ll take a diet Yoo-Hoo if you have it.\nMrs Cooper: You\xe2\x80\x99ll take a Cola.* What about you? Radge, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? Oh, you still having trouble talking to the ladies? Because, you know, at our church we have a woman who\xe2\x80\x99s an amazing healer. Mostly she does, uh, crutch and wheelchair people, but I bet she\xe2\x80\x99d be willing to take a shot at whatever Third World demon is running around inside of you.\nLeonard: Uh, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind, Mrs. Cooper, there\xe2\x80\x99s a 3:05 nonstop back to Los Angeles, and you have no idea how much I want to be on it.\nMrs Cooper: A girl?\nLeonard: Uh, yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\nMrs Cooper: Oh, good. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been praying for you. Oh, Sheldon.\nSheldon: What are they doing here?\nLeonard: We came to apologize.\nHoward: Again.\nLeonard: And bring you home. So, why don\xe2\x80\x99t you pack up your stuff and we\xe2\x80\x99ll head back.\nLeonard: No, this is my home now. Thanks to you, my career is over and I will spend the rest of my life here in Texas trying to teach evolution to creationists.\nMrs Cooper: You watch your mouth, Shelly. Everyone\xe2\x80\x99s entitled to their opinion.\nSheldon: Evolution isn\xe2\x80\x99t an opinion, it\xe2\x80\x99s fact.\nMrs Cooper: And that is your opinion.\nSheldon: I forgive you. Let\xe2\x80\x99s go home.\nMrs Cooper: Don\xe2\x80\x99t tell me prayer doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work.\nScene: In Penny\xe2\x80\x99s bed.\nLeonard: How about that? I finally caught a break.\nPenny: Uh-huh.\nLeonard: You know how they say when friends have sex it can get weird?\nPenny: Sure.\nLeonard: Why does it have to get weird?\nPenny: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\nLeonard: I mean, we were friends, and now we\xe2\x80\x99re more than friends. We\xe2\x80\x99re whatever this is. But why label it, right? I mean, it is what it is and\xe2\x80\xa6\nPenny: Leonard?\nLeonard: Yeah?\nPenny: It\xe2\x80\x99s weird.\nLeonard: Totally.\n(* This scene was originally filmed using the word \xe2\x80\x9ccoke\xe2\x80\x9d but it was overdubbed for television purposes. On the DVD version, the original is used.)\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
