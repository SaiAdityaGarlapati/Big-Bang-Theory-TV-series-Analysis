b'Scene: The apartment, the living room.\nHoward: Watch this, it\xe2\x80\x99s really cool. Call Leonard Hofstadter.\nHoward\xe2\x80\x99s phone: Did you say, call Helen Boxleitner?\nHoward: No. Call Leonard Hofstadter.\nHoward\xe2\x80\x99s phone: Did you say, call Temple Beth Sader.\nHoward: No.\nLeonard: Here, let me try. Call McFlono McFloonyloo. Heh-heh.\nHoward\xe2\x80\x99s phone: Calling Rajesh Koothrappali. (Raj\xe2\x80\x99s phone rings).\nRaj: Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s very impressive. And a little racist.\nSheldon: If we\xe2\x80\x99re all through playing mock the flawed technology, can we get on with Halo night, we were supposed to start at eight, it is now 8:06.\nLeonard: So? We\xe2\x80\x99ll start now.\nSheldon: Yes, first we have to decide if those lost six minutes will be coming out of game time, bathroom time or the pizza break.\nRaj: We can split it two, two and two.\nHoward: If we\xe2\x80\x99re having anchovies on the pizza we can\xe2\x80\x99t take it out of bathroom time. (There is a knock on the door.)\nSheldon: Oh, what fresh hell is this?\nLeonard (opening door): Hey Penny, come on in.\nPenny: Hey guys.\nHoward: See a Penny, pick her up, and all the day you\xe2\x80\x99ll have good luck.\nPenny: No you won\xe2\x80\x99t. Uh, can I hide out here for a while.\nLeonard: Sure. What\xe2\x80\x99s going on.\nPenny: Well, there\xe2\x80\x99s this girl I know from back in Nebraska, Christie, well anyway she called me up and she\xe2\x80\x99s like \xe2\x80\x9cHey, how\xe2\x80\x99s California,\xe2\x80\x9d and I\xe2\x80\x99m like \xe2\x80\x9cAwesome\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x98cos, you know, it\xe2\x80\x99s not Nebraska, and the next thing I know she\xe2\x80\x99s invited herself out here to stay with me.\nSheldon: 8:08.\nPenny: Anyway, she got here today, and she\xe2\x80\x99s just been in my apartment, yakkety-yakking about every guy she\xe2\x80\x99s slept with in Omaha, which is basically every guy in Omaha, and washing the sluttiest collection of underwear you have ever seen in my bathroom sink.\nHoward: Well, is she doing it one thong at a time, or does she just throw it all in, like some sort of erotic bouillabaisse.\nPenny: He really needs to dial it down.\nLeonard: So, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t like this Christie, why are you letting her stay?\nPenny: Well, she was engaged to my cousin while she was sleeping with my brother, so she\xe2\x80\x99s kind of family.\nSheldon: You know, I apologise for my earlier outburst, who needs Halo when we can be regaled with the delightfully folksy tale of the whore of Omaha?\nLeonard: Oh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think she\xe2\x80\x99s a whore.\nPenny: No, yeah she\xe2\x80\x99s definitely a whore. I mean, she has absolutely no standards, this one time, she was at\xe2\x80\xa6 where\xe2\x80\x99s Howard?\nHoward (voice off): Bonjour mademoiselle, I understand you\xe2\x80\x99re new in town.\nSheldon: Oh good grief.\nCredit Sequence\nScene: Penny, Sheldon, Raj and Leonard stand in the apartment doorway. Romantic music plays from Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment door.\nPenny: Ugh, I cannot believe Christie let Howard into my apartment.    \nSheldon: And I cannot believe people pay for horoscopes, but on a more serious note it\xe2\x80\x99s 8:13 and we\xe2\x80\x99re still not playing Halo.\nLeonard: Okay, fine, we\xe2\x80\x99ll just play one on one until he gets back.\nSheldon: One on one? We don\xe2\x80\x99t play one on one, we play teams, not one on one. One on one!\nLeonard: Well the only way we can play teams at this point is if we cut Raj in half.\nRaj: Oh, sure, cut the foreigner in half, there\xe2\x80\x99s a billion more where he came from.\nPenny: Hey, if you guys need a fourth, I\xe2\x80\x99ll play.\nLeonard: Great idea.\nSheldon: Uh, no. The wheel was a great idea. Relativity was a great idea. This is a notion, and a rather sucky one at that.\nPenny: Why?\nSheldon: Why? Oh, Penny, Penny, Penny.\nPenny: Oh, what, what, what?\nSheldon: This is a complex battle simulation with a steep learning curve, there are myriad weapons, vehicles and strategies to master, not to mention an extremely intricate back-story.\nPenny (picking up a controller, there is the sound of an explosion from the television): Oh cool, whose head did I just blow off?\nSheldon: Mine.\nPenny: Okay, I got this, lock and load boys.\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s the only way we can play teams.\nSheldon: Yes, but whoever\xe2\x80\x99s her partner will be hamstrung by her lack of experience and not to mention that fact that sh\xe2\x80\xa6. (another explosion)\nPenny: Ha-ha, there goes your head again.\nSheldon: Okay, this isn\xe2\x80\x99t at all good sportsmanship to shoot somebody who\xe2\x80\x99s just respawned, you need to give them a chance to (explosion) now come on!\nTime shift\nSheldon: Raj, Raj, she\xe2\x80\x99s got me cornered, cover me.\nPenny: Cover this, suckers. Ha-ha-ha!\nLeonard: Penny, you are on fire.\nPenny: Yeah, so is Sheldon.\nSheldon: Okay, that\xe2\x80\x99s it, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how, but she is cheating. No-one can be that attractive and be this skilled at a video game.\nPenny: Wait, wait, Sheldon, come back, you forgot something.\nSheldon: What?\nPenny: This plasma grenade. (Explosion.) Ha! Look, it\xe2\x80\x99s raining you!\nSheldon: You laugh now, you just wait until you need tech support.\nPenny: Gosh, he\xe2\x80\x99s kind of a sore loser, isn\xe2\x80\x99t he?\nLeonard: Well, to be fair, he is also a rather unpleasant winner.\nPenny: Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s been fun.\nLeonard: You know, Penny, we make such a good team, maybe we could enter a couple of Halo tournaments sometime.\nPenny: Or we could just have a life.\nLeonard: I guess for you that\xe2\x80\x99s an option.\nPenny: Good night, Leonard.\nLeonard: Good night.\nPenny: As usual, nice talking to you Raj (leaves.)\nRaj: What do you suppose she meant by that?\nLeonard: She\xe2\x80\x99s an enigma, Raj.\nSheldon: And another thing, there\xe2\x80\x99s a certain ethic to the game, Penny, a well estab\xe2\x80\xa6\nLeonard: She\xe2\x80\x99s gone, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Well she could have said goodbye.\nPenny (entering again): Okay, I have a problem.\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s called carpal tunnel syndrome, and quite frankly you deserve it.\nLeonard: What\xe2\x80\x99s wrong?\nPenny: Um, well, Howard and Christie are\xe2\x80\xa6 kind of\xe2\x80\xa6 hooking up in my bedroom.\nLeonard: Are you sure?\nPenny: Look, I grew up on a farm, okay, from what I heard they\xe2\x80\x99re either having sex or Howard\xe2\x80\x99s caught in a milking machine. Do you mind if I stay here tonight?\nLeonard: No, take the couch, or my bed, I just got new pillows, hypo-allergenics.\nPenny: Uh, the couch is good.\nSheldon: Hold that thought, Leonard, a moment.\nLeonard: Let me guess, you have a problem with this.\nSheldon: Where do I begin?\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s up to you, crazy person\xe2\x80\x99s choice.\nSheldon: Well first, we don\xe2\x80\x99t have house guests, frankly if I could afford the rent I\xe2\x80\x99d ask you to leave.\nLeonard: Your friendship means a lot to me as well, what else?\nSheldon: Well, our earthquake supplies, we have a two day, two man kit.\nLeonard: So?\nSheldon: So, if there is an earthquake and the three of us are trapped here, we could be out of food by tomorrow afternoon.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, are you suggesting that if we let Penny stay we might succumb to cannibalism?\nSheldon: No-one ever thinks it will happen until it does.\nLeonard: Penny, if you promise not to chew the flesh off our bones while we sleep, you can stay.\nPenny: Hu.. what?\nSheldon: He\xe2\x80\x99s engaging in reductio-ad-absurdum. It\xe2\x80\x99s the logical fallacy of extending someone\xe2\x80\x99s argument to ridiculous proportions and then criticising the result, and I do not appreciate it.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99ll get you a blanket and a pillow.\nSheldon: Okay, well since I\xe2\x80\x99m obviously being ignored here, let\xe2\x80\x99s go over the morning schedule, I use the bathroom from 7 to 7:20, plan your ablutions and bodily functions accordingly.\nPenny: How am I supposed to plan my bodily functions?\nSheldon: I suggest no liquids after 11pm.\nLeonard: Here you go.\nPenny: Thanks Leonard. (Arranges pillows on left of couch.)\nSheldon: Hmmph, wrong.\nPenny: I\xe2\x80\x99m listening.\nSheldon: Your head goes on the other end.\nPenny: Why?\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s culturally universal, a bed, even a temporary bed, is always oriented with the headboard away from the door. It serves the ancient imperative of protecting oneself against marauders.\nPenny: I\xe2\x80\x99ll risk it.\nSheldon: Hm!\nPenny: Anything else I should know.\nSheldon: Yes. If you use my toothbrush I\xe2\x80\x99ll jump out that window. Please don\xe2\x80\x99t come to my funeral. Have a good night.\nLeonard: Sorry about that.\nPenny: That\xe2\x80\x99s okay.\nLeonard: FYI, his toothbrush is the red one in the plexiglass case under the UV light.\nPenny: Got it.\nLeonard: Well, sleep tight.\nPenny: Thanks.\nLeonard: Funny expression, sleep tight. It refers to the early construction of beds which featured a mattress suspended on interlocking ropes which would occasionally\xe2\x80\xa6 sleep tight.\n(Penny turns off light and lies down on couch. Across the room, Raj is still in the kitchen, eating a sandwich. Realising everyone has forgotten about him, he quietly lets himself out. Penny hears the door close, looks worried, then moves her head to the other end of the couch.)\nScene: The following morning. Sheldon is in the kitchen making breakfast. He crosses to the couch, sees Penny sleeping there, looks lost. He is about to sit down on Penny when Leonard enters.\nLeonard: What are you doing?\nSheldon: Every Saturday since we have lived in this apartment, I have awakened at 6:15, poured myself a bowl of cereal, added a quarter cup of 2% milk, sat on this end of this couch, turned on BBC America and watched Doctor Who.\nLeonard: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s still sleeping.\nSheldon: Every Saturday since we have lived in this apartment, I have awakened at 6:15, poured myself a bowl of cereal\xe2\x80\xa6.\nLeonard: I know, I know, look, you have a TV in your room, why don\xe2\x80\x99t you just have breakfast in bed?\nSheldon: Because I am neither an invalid nor a woman celebrating Mother\xe2\x80\x99s Day.\nPenny: Uh, what time is it?\nLeonard: Almost 6:30.\nPenny: I slept all day?\nLeonard: Oh, no, it\xe2\x80\x99s 6:30 in the morning.\nPenny: What the hell is your problem?\nSheldon: Okay, this cereal has lost all its molecular integrity, I now have a bowl of shredded wheat paste.\nHoward (entering): Ola, nerd-migos.\nPenny: Why do you people hate sleep? Are you wearing my robe?\nHoward: Oh, yeah, sorry, I\xe2\x80\x99ll have it cleaned.\nPenny: That\xe2\x80\x99s okay, keep it. Where\xe2\x80\x99s Christie.\nHoward: In the shower. Oh, by the way, where did you get that loofah mitt, yours reaches places that mine just won\xe2\x80\x99t.\nPenny: Y-you used my loofah?\nHoward: More precisely we used your loofah. I exfoliated her brains out!\nPenny: You can keep that too.\nHoward: Ah, well then we\xe2\x80\x99ll probably need to talk about your stuffed bear collection.\nChristie (voice off): Howard?\nHoward: In here my lady.\nChristie (entering): Mmmm, there\xe2\x80\x99s my little engine that could.\nHoward: chka-chka-chka-chka-chka-chka-chka (they kiss).\nSheldon: Well there\xe2\x80\x99s one beloved children\xe2\x80\x99s book I\xe2\x80\x99ll never read again.\nChristie: Hi, Christie.\nLeonard: Leonard.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m Sheldon.\nChristie: Right, you\xe2\x80\x99re Howard\xe2\x80\x99s entourage.\nPenny: Uh, so Christie, what are your plans?\nChristie: Oh, well, Howard said he\xe2\x80\x99d take me shopping in Beverley Hills.\nPenny: Yeah, no, I meant plans to find some place to live. Other than with me, not that I don\xe2\x80\x99t love having you, but it\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\xa6 a little crowded.\nLeonard: Penny, you\xe2\x80\x99re always welcome to stay with us.\nSheldon: Oh, terrific, now we\xe2\x80\x99re running a cute little B&B.\nHoward: Let me offer a little outside the box thinking here, why doesn\xe2\x80\x99t Christie stay with me.\nLeonard: For one thing you live with your mother.\nHoward: I do not, my mother lives with me.\nSheldon: Well then, it\xe2\x80\x99s all settled, Christie will stay with Howard, Penny can go back to her apartment, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll watch the last 24 minutes of Doctor Who, although at this point it\xe2\x80\x99s more like Doctor Why Bother.\nLeonard: Sheldon you just can\xe2\x80\x99t dictate\xe2\x80\xa6\nSheldon: No more talking, everybody go.\nHoward: So, what do you say, you wanna repair to Castle Wolowitz?\nChristie: What is that, like a Mexican deli?\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, I should have mentioned this earlier, my last name is Wolowitz.\nChristie: Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s so cool. My first Jew!\nSheldon: I imagine there aren\xe2\x80\x99t many kosher corn-huskers.\nChristie: But you\xe2\x80\x99re still taking me shopping, right?\nHoward: Anything you want.\nChristie: Okay, I\xe2\x80\x99ll go pack my stuff.\nHoward: When they perfect human cloning I\xe2\x80\x99m going to order twelve of those.\nLeonard: Howard, can\xe2\x80\x99t you see she\xe2\x80\x99s using you?\nHoward: Who cares, last night she pulled off her blouse and I wept!\nPenny: Look, Howard, I know her, okay, she\xe2\x80\x99ll have sex with anyone as long as they keep buying her things.\nHoward: Really?\nPenny: Yeah.\nHoward: Yay! If you\xe2\x80\x99ll excuse me, I have some Bar-Mizvah bonds to cash.\nScene: A Chinese restaurant.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, we cannot do this without Wolowitz.\nLeonard: We can\xe2\x80\x99t order Chinese food without Wolowitz?\nSheldon: Let me walk you through it, our standard is, the steamed dumpling appetizer, General So\xe2\x80\x99s chicken, beef with broccoli, shrimp with lobster sauce and vegetable lo-main. Do you see the problem?\nLeonard: I see a problem.\nSheldon: Our entire order is predicated on four dumplings and four entrees divided among four people.\nLeonard: So, we\xe2\x80\x99ll just order three entrees.\nSheldon: Fine, what do you want to eliminate, and who gets the extra dumpling.\nRaj: We could cut it into thirds.\nSheldon: Then it is no longer a dumpling, once you cut it open it is at best a very small open faced sandwich.\nWaiter: Hi fellas. Oh, where\xe2\x80\x99s your annoying little friend who thinks he speaks Mandarin?\nSheldon: He\xe2\x80\x99s putting his needs ahead of the collective good. (Pointing at waiter) Where he comes from, that\xe2\x80\x99s punishable by death.\nWaiter: I come from Sacramento.\nLeonard: Can we get an order of dumplings, but with three instead of four.\nWaiter: No substitutions.\nLeonard: This isn\xe2\x80\x99t a substitution, it\xe2\x80\x99s a reduction.\nWaiter: Okay, no reductions.\nLeonard: Fine, bring us three orders of dumplings, that\xe2\x80\x99s twelve, we\xe2\x80\x99ll each have four.\nRaj: That works.\nSheldon: No, if we fill up on dumplings we\xe2\x80\x99ll need to eliminate another entree.\nWaiter: No eliminations.\nLeonard: If we have extra, we\xe2\x80\x99ll just take the leftovers home.\nSheldon: And divide it how, I\xe2\x80\x99m telling you we cannot do this without Wolowitz.\nLeonard: Wolowitz is with his new girlfriend, if you had let me invite Penny then you would have had your fourth.\nSheldon: Have you seen Penny eat Chinese food, she uses a fork, and she double dips her egg rolls.\nLeonard: We don\xe2\x80\x99t order egg rolls.\nSheldon: Exactly, but we\xe2\x80\x99d have to if she was here.\nRaj: Can we please make a decision, not only are there children starving in India, there\xe2\x80\x99s an Indian starving right here.\nLeonard: Here\xe2\x80\x99s an idea, why don\xe2\x80\x99t we just go out for Indian food.\nSheldon: No.\nRaj: Uurgh.\nWaiter: You are nice boys. Tell you what I\xe2\x80\x99m going to do. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to bring you the four dumplings. When I\xe2\x80\x99m walking over to the table, maybe I get bumped, one of the dumplings falls to the floor, no-one has to know.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99ll know.\nWaiter: (wanders away cursing in Mandarin.)\nRaj: How about soup?\nLeonard: Yeah, we can always divide soup.\nSheldon: What about the won-tons?\nScene: Outside Penny\xe2\x80\x99s door. Leonard knocks.\nPenny (answering): Oh, hey guys, what\xe2\x80\x99s up?\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s Halo night.\nPenny: Yeah. Okay. So?\nLeonard: Well, with Wolowitz spending all of his time with your friend Christie,\nPenny: She\xe2\x80\x99s not my friend. Friends do not get their friends care bears all sweaty.\nLeonard: Right, anyway, uh, with Wolowitz occupied elsewhere, we had something we wanted to ask you. Sheldon?\nSheldon: Yes. Penny, we would very much appreciate it if you would be the fourth member of our Halo team. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I need to tell you what an honour this is.\nPenny: Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s so sweet. But I\xe2\x80\x99m going out dancing with a girlfriend.\nSheldon: You can\xe2\x80\x99t go out, it\xe2\x80\x99s Halo night.\nPenny: Well, for Penny it\xe2\x80\x99s dancing night.\nSheldon: You go dancing every Wednesday.\nPenny: No.\nSheldon:  Then it\xe2\x80\x99s not dancing night.\nPenny: Look, why don\xe2\x80\x99t I play with you guys tomorrow?\nSheldon: Tonight is Halo night, it\xe2\x80\x99s like talking to a wall.\nPenny: Alright, now Sheldon, you and I are about to have a problem.\nLeonard: Sheldon, remember, we role-played this.\nSheldon: Yes, but you didn\xe2\x80\x99t portray her as completely irrational.\nPenny: Alright fellas, I gotta go. Good luck.\nLeonard: Maybe we should have asked if we could go dancing with her and her girlfriend.\nSheldon: Okay, assuming we could dance, which we can\xe2\x80\x99t, there are three of us and two of them.\nLeonard: So?\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s the Chinese restaurant all over again. I assure you that cutting a dumpling in thirds is child\xe2\x80\x99s play compared with three men, each attempting to dance with 67% of a woman.\nLeonard: Aaah, for God\xe2\x80\x99s sake, Sheldon, you are driving me crazy.\nSheldon: Your anger\xe2\x80\x99s not with me, sir, but with basic mathematics.\nLeonard: No, I\xe2\x80\x99m pretty sure my anger\xe2\x80\x99s with you.\nRaj: What\xe2\x80\x99s happening to us? We\xe2\x80\x99re falling apart.\nLeonard: Who are you calling?\nSheldon: The only man who can restore any semblance of balance to our universe.\nHoward (voice):  Hi this is Howard Wolowitz.\nChristie (voice): And this is Christie Van Der Bell.\nHoward (voice): We can\xe2\x80\x99t get to the phone right now because we\xe2\x80\x99re having sex.\nChristie (voice): You\xe2\x80\x99re not going to put that on your message are you?\nHoward (voice): No, I\xe2\x80\x99m just kidding, I\xe2\x80\x99ll re-record it. (beep)\nScene: Outside Howard\xe2\x80\x99s house.\nLeonard: Sheldon, think this through, you\xe2\x80\x99re going to ask Howard to choose between sex and Halo.\nSheldon: No, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to ask him to choose between sex and Halo 3. As far as I know, sex has not been upgraded to include high-def graphics and enhanced weapon systems.\nLeonard: You\xe2\x80\x99re right, all sex has is nudity, orgasms and human contact.\nSheldon: My point.\nChristie (voice from within): I\xe2\x80\x99m just saying, you can take the damned plastic off the couch once in a while.\nHoward\xe2\x80\x99s Mother (voice): Why, so you and Howard can hump on it?\nHoward (voice): Ladies, ladies, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure there\xe2\x80\x99s a middle ground.\nChristie and Howard\xe2\x80\x99s Mother together: Shut up Howard.\nHoward (voice): You girl\xe2\x80\x99s talk, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to take my scooter out for a little spin.\nChristie (voice as Howard emerges through door): Are you happy, you drove your own son out of the house.\nHoward\xe2\x80\x99s Mother (voice): Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you stop butting in where you don\xe2\x80\x99t belong.\nHoward: What are you guys doing here?\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s Halo night.\nHoward\xe2\x80\x99s Mother (voice): He\xe2\x80\x99s not a man, he\xe2\x80\x99s a putz, and don\xe2\x80\x99t you take that tone with me, you gold digger.\nChristie (voice): What did you call me?\nHoward\xe2\x80\x99s Mother (voice): You heard me, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you something else, you\xe2\x80\x99re barking up the wrong tree, cos as long as you\xe2\x80\x99re around, Howard is out of the will.\nChristie: (voice): You know what, I got better offers, I\xe2\x80\x99m out of here.\nHoward\xe2\x80\x99s Mother (voice): That\xe2\x80\x99s right, go back to Babylon, you whore.\nHoward: So, Halo night, huh?\nRaj: I thought she was the whore of Omaha?\nSheldon: Shhh!\nScene: The apartment, Halo night.\nHoward: Sheldon, you got him in your sights, fire, he\xe2\x80\x99s charging his plasma rifle.\nSheldon: I can\xe2\x80\x99t shoot now, I\xe2\x80\x99m cloaking.\nLeonard: Now, Raj, kill Sheldon.\nRaj: I can\xe2\x80\x99t see him.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s why the call it cloaking, dead man.\nLeonard: Well then start throwing grenades.\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99m all out.\nPenny (entering with three other sexy women): Hi guys, my friends and I got tired of dancing, so we came over to have sex with you.\nLeonard: That will do, Raj, straight for the tank.\nSheldon: We said no tanks.\nRaj: There are no rules in hell!\nHoward: Son of a bitch, medpack, I need a medpack!\nPenny: Told yah! (They leave).\nLeonard: There\xe2\x80\x99s a sniper, use your rocket launcher.\nRaj: All I\xe2\x80\x99ve got is a needler, and I\xe2\x80\x99m all out of ammo.\nSheldon: And now you\xe2\x80\x99re out of life. Why did you hit pause?\nLeonard: I thought I heard something.\nRaj: What?\nLeonard: No, never mind, alright, go.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
