b'Scene: The apartment.\nLeonard: The math is all there. It\xe2\x80\x99s not real.\nPenny: Yes, it is.\nSheldon: Yeah,uh, look, it is scientifically impossible for a person to tip a cow. Even you, with your stocky build and lumberjack shoulders, you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do it.\nRaj: It\xe2\x80\x99s horrible. Why would you push a cow over? They\xe2\x80\x99re sacred.\nPenny: Oh, stop it. I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen you eat, like, a million hamburgers.\nRaj: Hey, an animal can be both sacred and delicious.\nPenny: Look, I\xe2\x80\x99m telling you I\xe2\x80\x99ve done it, okay? I clearly remember the cow standing up and then the cow on its side.\nLeonard: Were you drunk?\nPenny: I was 16 in Nebraska. What do you think?\nLeonard: I think you\xe2\x80\x99re the one who fell over.\nPenny: That would explain why the sky was also on its side.\nHoward: Hey.\nPenny: Howard. Cow tipping. Real or not?\nHoward: Mmm. I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna say not. That\xe2\x80\x99s just based on me trying to roll my mom over when she\xe2\x80\x99s snoring. Speaking of that big side of beef, uh, she\xe2\x80\x99s invited all of you to Thanksgiving at her house.\nSheldon: Mmm. You know, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been told that a bald refusal of an invitation is rude and one must instead offer up a polite excuse, so I\xe2\x80\x99d love to go, but, unfortunately, that sounds awful.\nHoward: Come on, it\xe2\x80\x99ll be fun.\nPenny: Uh, we were actually gonna do it here.\nHoward: Please? Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s bringing her dad \xe2\x80\x99cause her mom\xe2\x80\x99s out of town, and I never have anything to say to that guy.\nSheldon: Oh, since you put it that way, I\xe2\x80\x99d love to go, but that sounds even more awful.\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99d actually be nice to not hear Sheldon complain about my cooking all day.\nSheldon: Uh, excuse me, but every year you prepare a terrible meal and every year I criticize it. Do our traditions mean nothing to you?\nLeonard: I want to go.\nPenny: Yeah, me, too.\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99m in.\nHoward: Sheldon.\nSheldon: Ugh, fine, I\xe2\x80\x99ll go. But if her food is delicious, Thanksgiving is ruined, and it\xe2\x80\x99s on you.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Do we really have to go to Mrs. Wolowitz\xe2\x80\x99s house?\nAmy: We do. And I expect you to be on your best behaviour.\nSheldon: Now I know how the African slaves felt. Being dragged from their homes to labour under the yoke of the white man.\nAmy: Are you honestly comparing Thanksgiving dinner at Wolowitz\xe2\x80\x99s mom\xe2\x80\x99s with one of the greatest tragedies in the history of mankind?\nSheldon: Yes.\nPenny: Sheldon, you can have a nice Thanksgiving anywhere. I spent one in Vegas.\nLeonard: You did?\nPenny: Yeah, back when I was dating Zack. It was actually more fun than I thought. We gambled, we went to one of those cheesy wedding chapels, we had a really good turkey dinner. Which was surprising, since we were at a strip club.\nLeonard: Wait, you went to a chapel?\nPenny: Yeah.\nLeonard: Why?\nPenny: We had one of those silly fake weddings.\nLeonard: Penny, you know those are real, right?\nPenny: No, they\xe2\x80\x99re not.\nLeonard: Yeah, they are.\nPenny: No, they\xe2\x80\x99re not.\nLeonard: Yeah, they are.\nSheldon: He\xe2\x80\x99s right.\nAmy: They\xe2\x80\x99re real.\nPenny: But it didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem real.\nSheldon: Let me ask you a question. At any point, was Las Vegas on its side?\nScene: Mrs Wolowitz\xe2\x80\x99s house.\nBernadette: Hi, Dad.\nMike: Hi, honey.\nBernadette: Oh, you brought beer for everybody.\nMike: Uh, okay, yeah, it\xe2\x80\x99s for everybody. I really just wanted to have a nice, quiet day at home and watch the game.\nBernadette: You can have a quiet day and watch the game here.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Howard, the medicine\xe2\x80\x99s not working.\nHoward (off): You just took it. At least let it reach your first stomach. (entering) Hey, Mike. Let me help you out, there.\nMike: Thanks. What\xe2\x80\x99s wrong with your mom?\nHoward: Oh, her gout\xe2\x80\x99s flaring up. Turns out an apple pie a day does not keep the doctor away.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): How can one little toe hurt so bad?\nHoward: Maybe because that little piggy is being crushed by the barn. She should quiet down soon. I gave her enough pain meds to choke a, well, her.\nBernadette: I guess we\xe2\x80\x99re gonna have to do all the cooking.\nHoward: I have a better idea.\nBernadette: If you think you\xe2\x80\x99re gonna make me do all this by myself, you\xe2\x80\x99re crazy.\nHoward: I was gonna make Raj do it all by himself.\nBernadette: Oh, well, that\xe2\x80\x99s a great idea.\nScene: Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s car.\nAmy: No traffic, we\xe2\x80\x99re sailing.\nSheldon: Yes. Like we\xe2\x80\x99re on a ship. Coming from Africa to America.\nAmy: Sheldon, that\xe2\x80\x99s completely inappropriate. You can\xe2\x80\x99t keep comparing yourself to a slave.\nSheldon: Yes, Miss Amy.\nLeonard: I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe you\xe2\x80\x99re married to that idiot.\nPenny: Ugh, would you stop? We just did it as a goof.\nLeonard: Well, a goof or not, you\xe2\x80\x99re actually married. You need to get this taken care of.\nPenny: I will. Why are you making this such a big deal?\nSheldon: Oh, oh, oh, I have a reason. It could be because you said yes to marrying Zack, but every time Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s proposed, he\xe2\x80\x99s gotten a resounding no. Yeah, that\xe2\x80\x99s just off the top of my head.\nPenny: So how do I undo this?\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m hoping you can get an annulment. It\xe2\x80\x99s just like it never happened.\nPenny: Great, well, what do I have to do?\nAmy: It says here you can get an annulment if any of the following conditions are met. Were you unable to consummate the marriage?\nSheldon: Hah!Penny? Next.\nAmy: Is there any evidence of fraud, bigamy, want of understanding?\nPenny: Want of understanding? What does that even mean?\nAmy: Ding, ding, ding. We have a winner.\nScene: Mrs Wolowitz\xe2\x80\x99s kitchen.\nBernadette: Thanks for saving the day.\nRaj: Ah, no problem. It wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be Thanksgiving without an Indian providing the food. Uh, now, where does your mom keep the Crisco?\nHoward: Um, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Probably in a wad in her cheek.\nBernadette: I\xe2\x80\x99ll help Raj in here. Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you go keep my dad company?\nHoward: He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want me in there. I\xe2\x80\x99m the creepy little guy who has sex with his daughter.\nBernadette: Don\xe2\x80\x99t be silly, he loves you.\nHoward: Does he?\nBernadette: Okay, he cares about you a lot.\nHoward: Really?\nScene: The living room.\nBernadette: I do crap for you all the time. Get out there.\nHoward: So your wife\xe2\x80\x99s in Arizona with the grandkids?\nMike: Uh-huh.\nHoward: You know, my mom\xe2\x80\x99s been to Arizona. She rode one of those mules down in the Grand Canyon. Long story short, they had to shoot it. \xe2\x80\x98Cause she\xe2\x80\x99s so fat. I\xe2\x80\x99ll get the door while you finish laughing. Hey, guys.\nAmy: Happy Thanksgiving.\nSheldon: It smells wonderful. Is anyone slaving away in the kitchen? Because I, too, know\xe2\x80\xa6\nAmy: Sheldon.\nPenny: Here. Thank you for having us.\nHoward: What\xe2\x80\x99s with you?\nLeonard: Oh, she\xe2\x80\x99s mad at me because she just found out she\xe2\x80\x99s married to Zack.\nHoward: Really? That dumb-ass she used to date? That\xe2\x80\x99s hysterical.\nPenny: I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe I felt bad for opening this in the car.\nScene: The kitchen.\nAmy: You need any help?\nRaj: Uh, yeah, can you, uh, reach that, uh, gravy boat up there?\nAmy: Uh, sure.\nRaj: Great. That makes one of you. Okay, we have a lot to do and not much time to do it. Bernadette, you\xe2\x80\x99re on corn, gravy and yam detail. Amy, you\xe2\x80\x99re on rolls, cranberries and making sure Bernadette stays away from the marshmallows. That\xe2\x80\x99s right, I see you. Okay, if you have any questions, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be over here basting my ass off. Focus is key.\nAmy: Did you guys know Penny married Zack three years ago?\nTogether: What?\nScene: The living room.\nHoward: You ever play football?\nMike: A little in college. You?\nHoward: No. But I did get tackled in the hallway once. The whole school cheered.\nLeonard: Okay, I found the, uh, court papers that you and Zack need to fill out. I\xe2\x80\x99ll print them when we get home.\nPenny: Fine.\nLeonard: And we can just put this whole thing behind us.\nPenny: Are you done?\nLeonard: What?\nPenny: Look, I get it, I screwed up. Is this all we\xe2\x80\x99re gonna talk about the rest of the day?\nLeonard: Why are you mad at me? You\xe2\x80\x99re the one that did the stupid thing. I\xe2\x80\x99m just trying to fix it.\nPenny: Ugh, I need some air.\nLeonard: Wuh, Penny.\nSheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the first thing about women, but I would not follow her.\nMike: Listen to Stretch.\nLeonard: How am I the bad guy? She\xe2\x80\x99s the one who married someone else. I\xe2\x80\x99m the victim.\nHoward: Sounds like Zack\xe2\x80\x99s the victim. You\xe2\x80\x99re sleeping with his wife.\nMike: I\xe2\x80\x99ve kept my marriage together for 35 years. Can I weigh in here?\nLeonard: Sure.\nMike: I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to watch the game. Shut up. Oh, how do you not make a first down there?\nSheldon: They passed against a nickel defence. They should have run it off-tackle.\nMike: How the hell do you know that?\nSheldon: My father loved football. He always made me watch it before I was allowed to do my homework.\nPenny: Well, you\xe2\x80\x99ll be happy to know I just spoke to Zack and he\xe2\x80\x99s willing to sign the court papers. He\xe2\x80\x99s on his way here now.\nLeonard: Wait, you invited him here?\nPenny: Yeah.\nMike: I\xe2\x80\x99m getting ready to weigh in again.\nLeonard: Come on.\nMike: What do you think they ought to do now?\nSheldon: I would throw a quick slant to a wideout, given that the defence is showing blitz.\nHoward: Oh, I love a good blitz, especially with sour cream. Get it? \xe2\x80\x98Cause it sounds like blintz.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Did someone say blintz?\nScene: The dining room.\nLeonard: I just don\xe2\x80\x99t understand why you invited him here today.\nPenny: Because you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t shut up about it. When I called him, he had nothing to do, so I just thought it would\xe2\x80\xa6\nRaj: Hey, guys, I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to cook in here.\nPenny: Oh, sorry. We\xe2\x80\x99ll keep it down.\nRaj: No, no, speak up. I\xe2\x80\x99m about to use the blender, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to miss anything.\nLeonard: Well, you might have to cook for one more because she invited Zack.\nBernadette: What?\nAmy: Ooh!\nRaj: My, my. The plot, like my gravy, thickens.\nScene: The living room.\nSheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t care for your mother\xe2\x80\x99s bathroom. There\xe2\x80\x99s not an angle to do one\xe2\x80\x99s business without a clown figurine staring at you.\nHoward: That\xe2\x80\x99s why I sit.\nMike: Yeah, that\xe2\x80\x99s why. You remember the Thanksgiving game when it snowed in Dallas?\nSheldon: 1993. Leon Lett blew the game in the final seconds and the Dolphins emerged victorious. Then I finally got to do my calculus.\nMike: I was so pissed, I wanted to shoot my TV.\nSheldon: So was my dad. And then he did.\nHoward: Anyone need a beer?\nMike: Yeah.\nHoward: Thank God.\nMike: So, does your dad still live in Texas?\nSheldon: No. He died when I was 14.\nMike: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry to hear that.\nSheldon: So was the man who owned the local liquor store. He cried and cried.\nHoward: Here you go.\nMike: Oh, thanks. So, if your dad died when you were 14, you were never old enough to have a beer with the man.\nSheldon: No, sir. He did try to give me one for my high school graduation, but I was 11 and my mom said no.\nMike: Well, you\xe2\x80\x99re having one with me.\nSheldon: All right.\nMike: To your dad.\nHoward: I never had a beer with my dad, either.\nSheldon: Do you mind? We\xe2\x80\x99re having a moment here.\nScene: The kitchen.\nAmy: I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe Penny\xe2\x80\x99s married to Zack.\nRaj: Wonder what she saw in that guy.\nBernadette: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. He\xe2\x80\x99s sweet, he\xe2\x80\x99s tall, handsome.\nAmy: Broad shoulders, good hair.\nRaj: Hmm. Wonder what she sees in Leonard.\nBernadette: How\xe2\x80\x99s it going out there?\nHoward: Sheldon and your dad are bonding and completely ignoring me.\nAmy: I know how you feel. Sheldon ignored me for a week when he got that Roomba vacuum. I kick it when he\xe2\x80\x99s not looking.\nBernadette: What are they doing?\nHoward: They\xe2\x80\x99re drinking beer and watching football.\nBernadette: So why don\xe2\x80\x99t you do that with them?\nHoward: They don\xe2\x80\x99t want me.\nBernadette: What do you mean?\nHoward: Well, Sheldon started talking about how his dad isn\xe2\x80\x99t alive any more, and they were toasting, and I tried to tell them about how sad I was when my dad abandoned\xe2\x80\xa6\nAmy: Zack\xe2\x80\x99s here!\nRaj: Stir the gravy.\nBernadette: Sorry. I really want to hear how sad you are. I\xe2\x80\x99ll be back in like five, ten minutes.\nScene: The dining room.\nLeonard: Sorry she made you come over here on a holiday.\nZack: It\xe2\x80\x99s all right. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t have anything going on. Plus, Penny told me we\xe2\x80\x99re married, and Thanksgiving\xe2\x80\x99s a time to be with family.\nPenny: Yeah, okay, great. Can we just get this over with?\nLeonard: Yeah, uh, you guys have to sign here and here. On Monday, we\xe2\x80\x99ll file for the annulment, and this marriage will be over.\nPenny: Okay.\nZack: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if I want to sign it.\nRaj, Bernadette and Amy: Ooh.\nLeonard: Why won\xe2\x80\x99t you sign it?\nZack: I just think splitting up can be rough on kids.\nPenny: We don\xe2\x80\x99t have any kids.\nZack: Are you sure? \xe2\x80\x98Cause you didn\xe2\x80\x99t know we were married until this morning.\nPenny: Okay, look, Zack, come on. You know neither of us thought this was real. I mean, we were married by an Elvis impersonator.\nZack: Of course it was an impersonator. We could never afford a real Elvis.\nLeonard: You married him instead of me? Good call. Sign the papers.\nPenny: Hang on. You know what? You have been a jerk about this all day. You always do this, whenever I mess up, you\xe2\x80\x99re right there to make me feel even worse about it.\nLeonard: That is not true.\nPenny: Yeah, we could\xe2\x80\x99ve waited till Monday, signed the papers, this all would have been over.\nLeonard: You\xe2\x80\x99re the one who invited him here.\nPenny: Oh, there you go again, just another mistake you\xe2\x80\x99re throwing in my face.\nZack: Not cool, bro. I\xe2\x80\x99m starting to think you\xe2\x80\x99re not the kind of guy I want dating my wife.\nLeonard: Yeah, well, she\xe2\x80\x99s not gonna be your wife for long.\nZack: Oh, no. Are you dying?\nPenny: I\xe2\x80\x99m about to. Sign the paper.\nZack: Know what they say, happy wife, happy life. Let\xe2\x80\x99s eat.\nScene: The living room.\nSheldon (burping): Two, three, eight, four, six. (Normal) That\xe2\x80\x99s all I can do without throwing up.\nMike: That is not what I expected when you said you were gonna burp pie.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Did somebody say pie?\nMike: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what\xe2\x80\x99s scarier, the bathroom clowns or the woman that put them there.\nSheldon: All I know is you can only fit one of her in a car. And there\xe2\x80\x99s the clown that came out of her. I really didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to come here, but this is shaping up to be one of the best Thanksgivings I\xe2\x80\x99ve had in a long time.\nMike: Me, too.\nBernadette: Hey. Howie says you\xe2\x80\x99ve been making fun of him all day. Now, both of you apologize right now.\nSheldon: She\xe2\x80\x99s so tiny. It\xe2\x80\x99s funny when she\xe2\x80\x99s mad.\nAmy: All right, mister, I think you owe Howard and Bernadette an apology.\nSheldon: Perhaps you\xe2\x80\x99re right. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry for my behaviour. I\xe2\x80\x99ve had alcohol, and it\xe2\x80\x99s caused me to be inappropriate.\nBernadette: It\xe2\x80\x99s okay.\nHoward: Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry about it.\nAmy: Thank you.\nSheldon: Ain\xe2\x80\x99t she great?\nMike: Mmm.\nAmy: Sheldon.\nSheldon: Now, how\xe2\x80\x99s about you get us a couple of beers?\nScene: The dining room.\nBernadette: Thanks again for cooking.\nAmy: Yeah, everything was delicious.\nRaj: Well, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have done it without my two favourite girls. Martha Stewart and Rachael Ray.\nMike: Hey, Sheldon, what do you say we go outside and throw around the old pigskin?\nSheldon: This is a Jewish house. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think they have pigskin.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Did someone say pigskin?\nPenny: Hey, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry about today. And I promise, next time I get married, it won\xe2\x80\x99t be a joke. It\xe2\x80\x99ll be for love. Or money.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, too.\nZack: Don\xe2\x80\x99t be. It\xe2\x80\x99s my fault. I was a terrible husband. I was never around.\nMike: I know I\xe2\x80\x99m hard on you, but you\xe2\x80\x99re not the worst son-in-law in the world.\nHoward: Mike, that\xe2\x80\x99s the nicest thing you\xe2\x80\x99ve ever said to me.\nMike: Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m drunk.\nSheldon: I just vomited on a lot of clowns.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
