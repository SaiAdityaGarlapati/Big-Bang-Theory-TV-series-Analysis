b'Scene: The Apartment.\nRaj: Howard\xe2\x80\x99s capsule should be re-entering the atmosphere any minute.\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99ll be good to have him back.\nRaj: The Fantastic Four reunited.\nSheldon: Yeah, you had a good run, Fake Wolowitz. We\xe2\x80\x99ll remember you with nostalgic fondness, the way we do the dial-up modem, the VHS tape, or, or Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s gym membership.\nRaj: We\xe2\x80\x99re not kicking him out. Stuart and I have become good friends.\nSheldon: Okay, one vote for, one vote against. Leonard, you\xe2\x80\x99re the tiebreaker.\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a problem with Stuart. Besides, he gives us a twenty percent discount at his comic book store.\nSheldon: Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t sell my friendship that cheaply.\nStuart: I can go thirty.\nSheldon: Welcome aboard, old chum.\nRaj: Okay, the NASA Web site says Howard\xe2\x80\x99s final descent has begun.\nSheldon: He left a boy, he returns a boy-sized hero.\nScene: The Soyuz Capsule. Howard is screaming.\nDimitri: Loops, calm down!\nHoward (singing): Baruch atah, Adonai, Eloheinu. Melech haolam, hamotzi. Lechem min haaretz\nMike: What\xe2\x80\x99s that?\nHoward: The Jewish prayer for eating bread! We don\xe2\x80\x99t have one for falling out of space! We did it! We\xe2\x80\x99re on the ground! We survived!\nMike: That was just the parachute. We still have another six miles to go. (Howard screams again)\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The Airport Arrivals Hall.\nBernadette: Waiting for my husband.\nMan in Suit: That\xe2\x80\x99s nice.\nBernadette: He\xe2\x80\x99s coming back from outer space.\nMan in Suit: I think this flight\xe2\x80\x99s coming from Houston.\nBernadette: No, I mean, he\xe2\x80\xa6 Never mind. There he is! Howie!\nVarious others (all at once): Howie! Howie!\nHoward: Whoa, thank you. Great to be back on Earth.\nHowie Mandel: Uh, I think they\xe2\x80\x99re here for me, Ringo.\nMan in Suit: Mr. Mandel, I\xe2\x80\x99m your driver.\nHowie Mandel: Oh, thanks. That nut job was telling everybody on the plane he\xe2\x80\x99s an astronaut.\nBernadette: I missed you so much.\nHoward: I missed you, too. Where are the guys?\nBernadette: Oh, it\xe2\x80\x99s just me.\nHoward: Oh, I get it. They\xe2\x80\x99re waiting back home with a big surprise party. Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry, I can act surprised. (Does)\nBernadette: No, I told them they could have you tomorrow night. Tonight, you belong to me. (Sneezes)\nHoward: Gesundheit. You okay?\nBernadette: I am now that you\xe2\x80\x99re back. Come on, let\xe2\x80\x99s go home so I can tear off those little pants.\nHoward: Great. Just keep in mind astronauts lose a lot of muscle tone in space, so you might have to do most of the heavy lifting.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: You know, I am very disappointed that I won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to celebrate Howard\xe2\x80\x99s accomplishment tonight.\nAmy: Me, too. But we\xe2\x80\x99ll see him tomorrow.\nSheldon: Yes, it\xe2\x80\x99s just that in all the years I\xe2\x80\x99ve known him, he\xe2\x80\x99s never had the opportunity to receive my admiration. I was excited to see the look on his face when it finally happened.\nPenny: You\xe2\x80\x99re unbelievable.\nSheldon: I know.\nLeonard: All right, Pictionary. What are the teams?\nPenny: How about boys versus girls?\nSheldon: Oh, that hardly seems fair. But I guess any team that I\xe2\x80\x99m not on has a decided disadvantage.\nPenny: Once again, unbelievable.\nSheldon: Yeah, once again, I know.\nPenny: All right, round one. Here.\nSheldon: Got it.\nPenny: Okay. Ready, set, go.\nAmy: Uh, box? Uh, window?\nLeonard: Batman. Batman and Robin. Uh, Wonder Twins plus the monkey. Wonder Twins plus the monkey and Batman.\nAmy: Uh, gift? Uh, Present!\nPenny: Present! Yeah!\nSheldon: Oh, Leonard. Now, how can you not get that?\nLeonard: In what universe is that a present?\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s not a present, it\xe2\x80\x99s the present. Look. There\xe2\x80\x99s you and me. There\xe2\x80\x99s Penny and Amy. We\xe2\x80\x99re playing Pictionary. In the present.\nPenny: Oh, my God, we\xe2\x80\x99re gonna kill them.\nLater\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s a quark-gluon plasma.\nLeonard: No.\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s asymptotically free partons inside a quark-gluon plasma.\nLeonard: Nothing with quarks.\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s an observational rebuttal of the Lambda-CDM model of the universe.\nLeonard: No.\nPenny: It\xe2\x80\x99s a chocolate chip cookie.\nAmy: Yes.\nLeonard: How could you miss that?\nSheldon: Hey, if you want someone to guess chocolate chip cookie, you draw a glass of milk next to it.\nLeonard: Penny got it.\nSheldon: Yeah, only after I eliminated all the obvious answers. You\xe2\x80\x99re welcome.\nLater\nLeonard: Oh, uh, uh, uh, sausage. Uh, uh, uh, uh, bratwurst? Oh, oh, a hot dog.\nAmy: Penny, aren\xe2\x80\x99t you gonna draw something?\nPenny: Relax, we got time, this is so fun.\nSheldon: There.\nLeonard: A solar system. Uh, uh, uh, uh, um, unidentified flying liverwurst? I don\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\xa6\nAmy: Now?\nPenny: Soon.\nSheldon: Come on, Leonard, I am spoon-feeding this to you.\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, uh, Casper the alcoholic ghost?\nPenny: All right, that\xe2\x80\x99s enough. (Draws)\nAmy: Uh, hand. Uh, nail, polish?\nPenny: Yep!\nSheldon: Wait, no, no. No. The word is Polish. See, look. Polish sausage. And the, the model of the solar system developed by Nicolaus Copernicus, a Polish astronomer. And then, finally, if that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t enough, which it should have been, this is Madame Curie killing herself by discovering radium, who, although she was a naturalized French citizen, was Polish by birth.\nPenny: Excuse me, the word is polish. See? Small P.\nSheldon: Ah. So it is. I guess we both share blame on this one.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s Bedroom.\nHoward: Bernie, you okay?\nBernadette (off): Yeah, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be right there. (Hacking and coughing noises)\nHoward: Did you get a sea lion while I was gone?\nBernadette: It\xe2\x80\x99s just allergies.\nHoward: Okay.\nBernadette: Took some Benadryl. I\xe2\x80\x99ll be fine. So, did you miss me?\nHoward: Oh. Are you kidding? Every minute of every\xe2\x80\xa6\nBernadette (has a coughing fit): Ew. Excuse me.\nHoward: Sweetie, we don\xe2\x80\x99t have to do this now.\nBernadette: Yes, we do. You left right after we got married. This is like our honeymoon. Now, hold on to your hat. Oh. Uh-oh.\nHoward: You okay?\nBernadette: A little dizzy. Must be the Benadryl. Switch places with me.\nHoward: Okay.\nBernadette: Now, kiss me. (He does. She starts snoring)\nHoward: Bernadette? Bernie? Bernie?\nBernadette (waking suddenly): That was amazing. You made me feel things I never\xe2\x80\xa6 (starts snoring again)\nHoward: Well, that was quick, and a little gross. Now, I know how she feels.\nScene: The apartment.\nPenny: Hey, Sheldon, you\xe2\x80\x99re always full of fun little facts. Where did the expression got your ass handed to you come from?\nSheldon: Don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\nPenny: I wonder if it\xe2\x80\x99s from, like, ancient Rome where they\xe2\x80\x99d actually chop somebody\xe2\x80\x99s ass off and then go, here. You know, to appease Loseroneous, the god of losers.\nSheldon: I am not a loser. Pictionary is not a true test of any real intelligence or skill.\nLeonard: Mmm, in all fairness, Pictionary has verbal skills, visual skills. It\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty well-rounded game.\nSheldon: Lot of big talk from a man who can\xe2\x80\x99t draw a chocolate chip cookie.\nPenny: All right, fine, pick another game. Amy and I will beat you at anything.\nSheldon: All right. Let\xe2\x80\x99s play Physics Fiesta.\nPenny: Oh, come on, what is that?\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s a game that I just invented, in which the participants answer physics questions in remedial Spanish. Um, \xc2\xbfD\xc3\xb3nde est\xc3\xa1 el boson de Higgs?\nLeonard: En el acelerador de particulares.\nSheldon: Bueno, mi amigo.\nPenny: No, no, we\xe2\x80\x99re not playing some dumb made-up game.\nSheldon: All games are made up. They\xe2\x80\x99re not found in nature. You don\xe2\x80\x99t just dig in the ground, come across a rich vein of Rock\xe2\x80\x99em Sock\xe2\x80\x99em Robots.\nLeonard: Just pick another game.\nAmy: Why don\xe2\x80\x99t we do something athletic like go over to the university pool and play water polo?\nLeonard: No good, Sheldon doesn\xe2\x80\x99t float.\nSheldon: That is true. I have a higher than normal body density. If I run too deep a bath, I drown.\nAmy: All right, let\xe2\x80\x99s keep it simple. How about darts?\nSheldon: No, that\xe2\x80\x99s not fair either.\nPenny: Why not?\nSheldon: Darts is a bar game. You\xe2\x80\x99ve been frequenting drinking establishments since you were of legal age.\nLeonard: Yeah, that\xe2\x80\x99s when it started.\nSheldon: Well, regardless, she has a distinct advantage in all tavern-based competitions. Pool, beer pong, wet T-shirt contests, they\xe2\x80\x99re all out.\nPenny: Okay. Just for the record, I have never entered a wet T-shirt contest. I\xe2\x80\x99ve won a few, but that\xe2\x80\x99s just because I spill when I\xe2\x80\x99m drunk, so\xe2\x80\xa6\nAmy: We could go to the cadaver lab at UCLA and play real-life Operation.\nSheldon: No.\nLeonard: Uh-uh.\nPenny: I don\xe2\x80\x99t think so.\nAmy: Are you sure? I mean, the nose doesn\xe2\x80\x99t light up, but if the corpse is fresh enough, sometimes you can get the leg to jerk.\nScene: Mrs Wolowitz\xe2\x80\x99s House.\nHoward: Hey, Ma, twinkle, twinkle, your little star is home. Ma, the chain\xe2\x80\x99s on the door.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Howard? I thought I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to see you till tomorrow.\nHoward: Yeah, well, Bernie\xe2\x80\x99s not feeling well, so I thought I\xe2\x80\x99d stop by, tell you about the greatest adventure of my life, see if you can make me feel bad about it.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Uh, uh, okay, hold on, I\xe2\x80\x99m not decent.\nHoward: All right. Woman hasn\xe2\x80\x99t tied her robe in 20 years. Suddenly she\xe2\x80\x99s not decent?\nMan\xe2\x80\x99s Voice (off): You want me to hide in the closet or go out the back?\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Shh, you need to whisper.\nHoward: Ma, who is in there?\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Uh, nobody. The TV is on.\nMan\xe2\x80\x99s Voice (off): I only got one sock. Where\xe2\x80\x99s my other sock?\nHoward: Who is that?\nMrs Wolowitz (off): I told you, it\xe2\x80\x99s the TV. Jay Leno lost a sock, it\xe2\x80\x99s hilarious.\nHoward: If you\xe2\x80\x99re busy, I can come back.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Just give me a second. Go, go, go, go.\nHoward (to man climbing out window): Dr. Schneider?\nDr Schneider: Oh, hello, Howard.\nHoward: What are you doing here?\nDr Schneider: Um, house call.\nHoward: You\xe2\x80\x99re a dentist.\nDr Schneider: Yes, yes, I am. I think he\xe2\x80\x99s on to us.\nScene: The apartment.\nPenny: Okay, glasses off. Find Waldo.\nSheldon: Hurry up, find him, find him.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m trying. Don\xe2\x80\x99t yell at me.\nSheldon: For goodness\xe2\x80\x99 sake, he\xe2\x80\x99s wearing a hat, glasses, and a red striped shirt.\nLeonard: I know what he looks like.\nAmy: Oh, there he is, I got him.\nPenny: Yes, we win again.\nSheldon: How could you not find him?\nLeonard: Because he\xe2\x80\x99s hard to find. If he was easy to find, the books would be called There\xe2\x80\x99s Waldo.\nLater. Penny and Sheldon have their foreheads on light sabres and are spinning.\nLeonard: 57, 58, 59, that\xe2\x80\x99s one minute.\nAmy: Long division, long division. Go, go, go.\nLeonard: Remember, show your work.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m okay. I\xe2\x80\x99m okay. I\xe2\x80\x99m not okay.\nLeonard: Get up, we can\xe2\x80\x99t lose at math.\nPenny: 37.\nAmy: Yes.\nLater\nAmy: Ready, set, wrestle. (Penny pins Sheldon straight away) One, two, three, pin.\nPenny: Mwah!\nSheldon: Stop that.\nPenny: Mwah!\nSheldon: Amy, do something. Amy, help. Amy, stop that. Amy, Penny, both of you, stop it.\nScene: Raj\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nHoward: One to beam aboard?\nRaj: Oh, my God, you\xe2\x80\x99re back. Oh, look at you. You, you look like you grew.\nHoward: Yeah. The lack of gravity did decompress my spine, so I\xe2\x80\x99m like an inch and a half taller. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to the DMV tomorrow to get my license changed before I shrink back.\nRaj: Oh, uh, come in, come in. Oh, I, uh, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t think I was going to get to see you until tomorrow.\nHoward: Yeah, well, Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s a little under the weather and my mom\xe2\x80\x99s kind of under my dentist.\nRaj: Wait, your, your mother is sleeping with your dentist?\nHoward: Former dentist. I need a new one now that I know where his hands have been.\nRaj: So you\xe2\x80\x99re wandering all around by yourself? That\xe2\x80\x99s not the kind of hero\xe2\x80\x99s welcome an astronaut should come home to.\nHoward: It\xe2\x80\x99s okay, you know, we space cowboys don\xe2\x80\x99t do what we do for glory and fame. We leave that to your rock stars and your athletes and your Howie Mandels.\nStuart: Oh, hey, man, welcome back.\nHoward: Oh, Stuart, thanks. What are you doing here?\nStuart: I, I kind of live here now.\nRaj: Just until he gets back on his feet, which are looking pretty good in the boots I bought him for his birthday.\nStuart: Ah, he\xe2\x80\x99s spoiling me and I love it.\nHoward: Wow, so you guys are like buds now?\nRaj: Oh, yeah, we hang out all the time.\nStuart: Plus, he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have a girlfriend, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a girlfriend.\nRaj: It\xe2\x80\x99s like we both had these holes in our lives, but now we fill each other\xe2\x80\x99s holes.\nStuart: Uh, that sounds a little funny to an American ear.\nRaj: Which part?\nStuart: Just all of it.\nHoward: Okay, so what do you guys got going on tonight?\nStuart: Raj is taking me to the Sound of Music sing-along.\nHoward: Sound of Music sing-along? That used to be our thing, but that\xe2\x80\x99s cool.\nRaj: Oh, Howard, it\xe2\x80\x99s still our thing. Come with us, we\xe2\x80\x99ll, we\xe2\x80\x99ll get you a scalped ticket.\nHoward: So I\xe2\x80\x99d be sitting by myself?\nRaj: We\xe2\x80\x99ll switch. You\xe2\x80\x99ll come sit with me after intermission.\nStuart: So I, I, I\xe2\x80\x99d be sitting by myself during Edelweiss?\nHoward: No, no, you guys go. Have fun.\nRaj: Okay, uh, will I get to see you tomorrow?\nHoward: Absolutely. See you, Stuart.\nStuart: Yeah, yeah. Is he taller?\nHoward: At least my mother made her boyfriend climb out the window.\nScene: The apartment.\nPenny: All right, standard state fair pie-eating contest rules are, no hands, first one to clean the pan wins.\nAmy: On the count of three. One, two\xe2\x80\xa6\nSheldon: Wait. I\xe2\x80\x99m a little concerned. Blueberries are rich in antioxidants.\nLeonard: So?\nSheldon: So, with all those antioxidants, what if I run out of oxidants?\nLeonard: Sheldon, we haven\xe2\x80\x99t won a game all night. Now, you either stick your face in that pie or I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna stick that pie in your face.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s rude.\nAmy: One, two, three, eat.\nHoward: Hey, guys, guess who\xe2\x80\x99s back from space.\nAll: Not now!\nSheldon: Oh, ow, blueberry in my nose, blueberry in my nose!\nLeonard: Snort it down and keep eating!\nScene: A diner.\nWaitress: You look familiar.\nHoward: I don\xe2\x80\x99t think so.\nWaitress: Yeah, I just saw you on the news. You\xe2\x80\x99re an astronaut.\nHoward: Yes. Yes, I am.\nWaitress: Good for you. How about a piece of cheesecake on the house?\nHoward: Oh, thank you so much. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been having the worst night. I just got back, and my friends don\xe2\x80\x99t care, my wife\xe2\x80\x99s sick, I went to my mom\xe2\x80\xa6\nWaitress: You want the cheesecake or not?\nHoward: Yes, please. (Sings) And I think it\xe2\x80\x99s gonna be long, long time till touchdown brings me \xe2\x80\x99round again to find I\xe2\x80\x99m not the man they think I am at home, oh, no, oh, no, I\xe2\x80\x99m a rocket man. (Sneezes) Perfect.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
