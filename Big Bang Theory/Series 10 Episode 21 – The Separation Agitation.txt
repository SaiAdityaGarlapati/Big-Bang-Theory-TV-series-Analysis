b'Scene: Sheldon and Amy\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nSheldon: All right, we\xe2\x80\x99re about to go live, everyone on their A-game, good energy. Hello. I\xe2\x80\x99m Dr. Sheldon Cooper.\nAmy: And I\xe2\x80\x99m Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler.\nSheldon: And welcome to a special retrospective, where we will take a look back at the history of Fun with Flags on an episode we\xe2\x80\x99re calling\xe2\x80\xa6\nTogether: Fun with Flags: Behind the Flags: A Retrospective.\nHoward (singing): Wondering how it all began?\nRaj (singing): You\xe2\x80\x99ll need a good attention span.\nHoward (singing): For information and entertainment.\nRaj (singing): That\xe2\x80\x99s equally effective.\nTogether (singing): It\xe2\x80\x99s fun with flags, behind the flags, a retrospective. Flags.\nSheldon: Mind you, when we say behind the flags, we don\xe2\x80\x99t literally mean these flags. That\xe2\x80\x99s just where we have dinner.\nAmy: Now, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure many of you are wondering how Fun with Flags began.\nSheldon: So let\xe2\x80\x99s hear from some people who were there at the very start. How, Howard, flashback sounds.\nAmy: Could have played that on my harp.\nSheldon: Just roll the clip. (On voiceover) So tell us in your own words about that magical moment when Fun with Flags was born.\nLeonard: I honestly don\xe2\x80\x99t remember.\nSheldon: Sure you do. I was telling you both the story about how Haiti and Lichtenstein discovered they had the same flag. It was at the Summer Olympics of 1936, and two plucky nations\xe2\x80\xa6\nPenny: Oh, wait. I remember.\nSheldon: Oh, and do you remember what you said?\nPenny: Yes. Please find someone who cares.\nSheldon: And that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what I did. I found a lot of someones.\nAmy: Almost 200. Many of them on purpose.\nSheldon: And now we\xe2\x80\x99re going to turn it over to you, the viewers, to call in and share your favourite Fun with Flags moments.\nAmy: And don\xe2\x80\x99t get discouraged if the phone lines are jammed. Just keep trying. (Long pause) Oh, thank God, welcome to Fun with Flags.\nBert: Hey, Sheldon. Hey, Amy. It\xe2\x80\x99s Bert.\nSheldon: Hello, Bert. What is your flag-related comment or query?\nBert: I have a girlfriend.\nAmy: And what does that have to do with flags?\nBert: Nothing. I just wanted everyone to know I have a girlfriend.\nSheldon: Bert, you\xe2\x80\x99re tying up the line. My apologies to all of you trying to call in with legitimate flag comments.\nAmy: Ooh, ooh. All right. We have our next caller.\nBert: Her name\xe2\x80\x99s Rebecca.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s van.\nHoward: Should we get lunch or you want to eat at the zoo? Oh, Howie, I don\xe2\x80\x99t need food as long as I can look at my phone.\nBernadette: I don\xe2\x80\x99t like when you imitate me.\nHoward: You want to hear my Stuart? It\xe2\x80\x99s been a while since I\xe2\x80\x99ve gone on a date. You mind if we watch the monkeys doing it?\nStuart: I said that to you in confidence.\nHoward: This is supposed to be our family fun day. What\xe2\x80\x99s so important on your phone?\nBernadette: I\xe2\x80\x99m on the day care\xe2\x80\x99s website.\nHoward: Stop looking at that. The day care\xe2\x80\x99s great. It\xe2\x80\x99s on campus. My office is two minutes away. There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to worry about.\nBernadette: What if she likes the people who work there more than us?\nHoward: She already likes soap bubbles more than us.\nBernadette: When I go back to work, we\xe2\x80\x99re gonna leave her with these people. We don\xe2\x80\x99t know anything about them.\nHoward: They\xe2\x80\x99re highly-trained educators with background checks. They\xe2\x80\x99re even required to be current on all vaccinations.\nStuart: You leave her with me, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not any of those things.\nScene: The cafeteria.\nSheldon: Where\xe2\x80\x99s Howard?\nRaj: He took the day off.\nSheldon: Oh, let\xe2\x80\x99s take advantage of his absence and tell the kinds of jokes only physicists get. I\xe2\x80\x99ll go first. Okay, here. Uh, Heisenberg is pulled over by a police officer. And the policeman says, did you know you were going 85 miles per hour? And Heisenberg says, darn it, now I don\xe2\x80\x99t know where I am.\nLeonard: So Howard back Monday?\nRaj: Yeah.\nBert: Hey, guys.\nSheldon: Oh, hello.\nLeonard: Hey. Want to join us?\nSheldon: Ah-ah-ah, he\xe2\x80\x99s a geologist, and I have more physics jokes.\nRaj: Oh, quick, sit.\nLeonard: So, Sheldon says you have a new girlfriend.\nSheldon: Yeah, which he rudely announced on my flag show. People were so upset about it no one else called in the rest of the night.\nBert: Sorry. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help myself. I guess I just love love.\nRaj: Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m very happy for you.\nLeonard: Hey, we\xe2\x80\x99re all having dinner tonight. Why don\xe2\x80\x99t the two of you join us?\nSheldon: Hold on. We don\xe2\x80\x99t know anything about this woman.\nBert: What do you want to know?\nSheldon: Is she a geologist?\nBert: No.\nSheldon: Oh great, see you at seven.\nScene: The Zoo.\nHoward: How about after this we go see the exotic bird show?\nStuart: Not a good idea. My hair is a coveted nesting material.\nHoward: Learning anything?\nBernadette: Well, sloth babies cling to their mothers\xe2\x80\x99 bodies for almost a year. I\xe2\x80\x99m going back to work after only four months, so I\xe2\x80\x99ve learned I hate myself, I hate sloths, and I hate you for bringing me here.\nHoward: Me I get, but that sloth is pretty cute.\nBernadette: It\xe2\x80\x99s not just the sloth. Polar bears nurse their cubs for almost eight months. The orangutan mother builds her baby a new home every night. And what do I do? I choose my career over my child.\nStuart: Told you we should have gone to Legoland.\nScene: The apartment.\nRaj: Can\xe2\x80\x99t believe Bert has a girlfriend and I don\xe2\x80\x99t.\nAmy: I thought you were taking a break from women to focus on your career.\nRaj: Oh, grow up.\nLeonard: Don\xe2\x80\x99t you have any friends he can date?\nPenny: Hey, I already set up Howard and Bernadette. It\xe2\x80\x99s your turn to ruin some poor girl\xe2\x80\x99s life.\nRaj: Oh, hey, guys. Come in.\nBert: Thanks. Everyone, this is Rebecca.\nRebecca: Hi.\nLeonard: Hey.\nSheldon: She\xe2\x80\x99s younger and far more attractive than he is. They\xe2\x80\x99re copying you two.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s kitchen.\nHoward: What are you making?\nStuart: Chicken. Birds mess with my hair, I come back hard.\nHoward: Finally get Halley down?\nBernadette: Yeah, eventually. She\xe2\x80\x99s still not happy about taking a bottle, though.\nHoward: Look, if you\xe2\x80\x99re not ready to go back to work, we\xe2\x80\x99ll figure something out.\nBernadette: No, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be fine.\nStuart: It might be good for her. Howard\xe2\x80\x99s mother was around him all the time, and he\xe2\x80\x99s a world-class mama\xe2\x80\x99s boy.\nHoward: I mean, why would you say that?\nStuart: Go ahead, have a tantrum, that\xe2\x80\x99ll prove me wrong.\nBernadette: It would be nice to raise Halley to be a little more independent than you were.\nHoward: I guess. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t until college that I learned you can put a thermometer in your mouth.\nStuart: On that charming note, dinner is served.\nScene: The apartment.\nPenny: So is this your first time dating a scientist? \xe2\x80\x98Cause I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking of starting a support group.\nRebecca: Actually, I\xe2\x80\x99m not new to this. I was engaged to a Scientologist.\nSheldon: Bert, Rebecca. I\xe2\x80\x99d like to apologize for my insensitive comment earlier.\nRebecca: Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry about it. It\xe2\x80\x99s fine.\nSheldon: See? It was fine. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t need a time-out.\nAmy: It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a time-out. Let\xe2\x80\x99s get some food.\nSheldon: You made me sit on the stairs and think about what I did.\nAmy: Get your food.\nRaj: So how did you two meet?\nRebecca: Oh, it\xe2\x80\x99s such a cute story. We met on a dating Web site.\nLeonard: Is that it?\nRebecca: Oh, sorry. The end.\nRaj: That\xe2\x80\x99s nice. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t had much success meeting people online.\nBert: I didn\xe2\x80\x99t either, until I revamped my profile.\nSheldon: What\xe2\x80\x99d you do, delete your photo?\nAmy: Go.\nSheldon: Fine.\nAmy: And don\xe2\x80\x99t you slam that door.\nSheldon: Aw, man.\nRebecca: Did I say something wrong?\nLeonard: No, it\xe2\x80\x99s always him.\nPenny: , Bert, you were telling us how you updated your profile?\nBert: Right. I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t getting any responses, and then I added recent $625,000 MacArthur grant winner, and five minutes later I met my soul mate.\nAmy: I was wrong. You can come back in.\nLeonard: So, Rebecca, how did you become a personal trainer?\nRebecca: I came to Los Angeles to be an actress, and things didn\xe2\x80\x99t really work out.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99d say she\xe2\x80\x99s copying you again, but I\xe2\x80\x99m getting tired of sitting in the hall.\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99d love a personal trainer. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen my abs since they opened a Shake Shack on my drive home.\nRebecca: I could give you some free sessions.\nPenny: Oh, is that offer for everybody?\nLeonard: Nice try. I\xe2\x80\x99m not going.\nRebecca: Where\xe2\x80\x99s your bathroom?\nLeonard: Mm, just down there.\nBert: She\xe2\x80\x99s so perfect, sometimes I think she isn\xe2\x80\x99t real. And then she goes to the bathroom, and I know she is.\nPenny: Aw, that\xe2\x80\x99s so weird.\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, Bert, but aren\xe2\x80\x99t you worried she\xe2\x80\x99s only with you for your money?\nBert: She better be. On our first date, I bought her an 80-inch flat-screen.\nSheldon: Your first date? Did you even measure her walls?\nPenny: You know, on our first date, Leonard used a coupon to buy me a pretzel.\nLeonard: And we lived happily ever after.\nPenny: The end.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s kitchen.\nBernadette: Well, guess I\xe2\x80\x99m ready to go.\nHoward: Have a great first day back.\nBernadette: You have everything she needs for day care?\nStuart: Yep, all in the bag.\nBernadette: Okay. Okay, sweetie, Mommy\xe2\x80\x99s gonna go to work now, so you have fun today.\nHoward: I told her if day care is anything like prison, find the biggest baby and knock him out.\nStuart: Bye, cutie. I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna miss you. I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna be waiting right here tonight when you get home.\nBernadette: Stop, you\xe2\x80\x99re gonna make me cry.\nHoward: Great, now everybody\xe2\x80\x99s crying.\nStuart: At least Halley\xe2\x80\x99s not.\nHoward: That\xe2\x80\x99s good.\nBernadette: She\xe2\x80\x99s not gonna see us all day, and she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t even care.\nScene: The cafeteria.\nSheldon: Who\xe2\x80\x99s ready to laugh?\nLeonard: O-o-o-o-oh.\nSheldon: Okay. So, Feynman, Einstein and Schrodinger walk into a bar. Feynman says, it appears\nwe\xe2\x80\x99re inside a joke. Einstein replies, but only to an observer who saw us walk in simultaneously. To which Schrodinger says, if someone\xe2\x80\x99s looking in the window, I\xe2\x80\x99m leaving.\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99s actually funny.\nRaj: You should send that to Jimmy Fallon.\nBert: Hey.\nLeonard: Oh, hello. Join us.\nRaj: Hey. Yeah. Hey, sorry if last night was awkward.\nBert: Actually, it got me thinking that I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t flaunt my money to find love. I might break up with Rebecca.\nLeonard: Wow, that\xe2\x80\x99s a big step.\nRaj: I think it shows a lot of character.\nBert: I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna hold out and see if I can find a hot young blonde who likes me for me.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s a good one. Okay, now, Leonard, you tell a joke.\nScene: The daycare.\nBernadette (on phone): How\xe2\x80\x99s she doing?\nHoward: She\xe2\x80\x99s great. Look.\nBernadette: I see a wall, floor, some Asian baby, there she is.\nHoward: See? Nothing to worry about.\nBernadette: Thank you. Okay, I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna try and get some work done.\nHoward: Yeah, me, too. Love you.\nBernadette: Love you, too. Bye.\nStuart: How is she?\nHoward: What are you doing here?\nStuart: Can\xe2\x80\x99t a guy hang out at a college he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t go to and stare at a baby that isn\xe2\x80\x99t his?\nHoward: I get it. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t even made it to my office yet.\nStuart: Is it weird if we just stand here and watch her all day?\nHoward: Probably. We should go.\nStuart: Yeah. Or we could take her to the aquarium.\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99ll get her, you grab her bag.\nStuart: Hang on, Halley, we\xe2\x80\x99re busting you out of there.\nScene: The apartment.\nAmy: What are you looking at?\nSheldon: Comments from our Behind the Flags retrospective. Get this, people are calling it the longest one yet.\nBert: Hello? Anybody home?\nLeonard: Is that Bert?\nBert: It\xe2\x80\x99s Bert.\nPenny: I think it\xe2\x80\x99s Bert.\nRaj: Hey, what\xe2\x80\x99s up?\nBert: I broke up with Rebecca.\nPenny: Oh.\nAmy: Oh. You know, good for you.\nBert: No, I miss her. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why I listened to you.\nSheldon: He\xe2\x80\x99s not wrong. It was your crackpot idea that he deserves love.\nAmy: You know, you need to start raising your hand before you speak. Yes, starting now.\nPenny: Bert, you\xe2\x80\x99re a good guy, you deserve a woman who\xe2\x80\x99s interested in more than just your money.\nBert: She was also interested in walking around my house in her underwear. Now the only one doing that is me.\nLeonard: If you\xe2\x80\x99re that upset, go get her back.\nBert: I tried. She\xe2\x80\x99s not answering my calls. Which really hurts because I bought her that phone. I made a huge mistake.\nRaj: No, you didn\xe2\x80\x99t. Okay? Look, Bert, when I had money, I dated lots of girls who weren\xe2\x80\x99t right for me. And then I gave up my money, and now I\xe2\x80\x99m alone and living with my friends, and somebody else should probably talk now.\nPenny: Look, sweetie, relationships aren\xe2\x80\x99t about money, okay? It\xe2\x80\x99s about respect and having things in common and\xe2\x80\xa6 yes, Sheldon?\nSheldon: You and Leonard don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything in common. Maybe you should break up.\nLeonard: You called on him.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s kitchen.\nStuart: Guess who\xe2\x80\x99s home from day care?\nHoward: It\xe2\x80\x99s Halley. Unless somebody else put an X on the bottom of their kid\xe2\x80\x99s foot.\nBernadette: You realize they called when you took her.\nHoward: Guess who\xe2\x80\x99s home from the aquarium?\nScene: The apartment.\nBert: Sorry again for barging in.\nLeonard: You don\xe2\x80\x99t have to go. You\xe2\x80\x99re welcome to hang with us.\nSheldon: Actually, our friendship group is at capacity. But if anybody drops out, you\xe2\x80\x99re at the top of the list. Unless it\xe2\x80\x99s Raj, in which case, we\xe2\x80\x99ll probably get a person of colour.\nBert: You guys are nice, but I\xe2\x80\x99m just gonna buy Rebecca a Jet Ski and see if that gets her back.\nRaj: I feel bad for Bert.\nSheldon: So he\xe2\x80\x99s using his money to attract a mate. Is that any different than me using my intelligence to attract Amy? Or Leonard using his power of grovelling to get Penny?\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s totally different. Bert\xe2\x80\x99s money might run out, but I can beg until the end of time.\nPenny: All that and he\xe2\x80\x99s shorter than me.\nRaj: Sheldon, what did Amy have that attracted you?\nSheldon: Oh, so many things. Her mind, her kindness, and especially her body.\nRaj: Really?\nAmy: Relax. We\xe2\x80\x99re the same blood type. He knew he could harvest an organ.\nScene: The daycare.\nHoward: She does look happy.\nBernadette: See? This is the right thing for her. Let\xe2\x80\x99s all just go to work.\nStuart: Any time.\nBernadette: Let me just say good-bye. Halley. Look at Mommy. Over here, honey. Say good-bye to Mommy. Look at me. Look at your mother. All right, we can go.\nScene: Sheldon and Amy\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nSheldon: Hello. I\xe2\x80\x99m Dr. Sheldon Cooper.\nAmy: And I\xe2\x80\x99m Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler.\nSheldon: Based on the glowing reception of our recent Behind the Flags retrospective, we thought you might like to see how it all came together.\nAmy: So welcome to tonight\xe2\x80\x99s episode,\nTogether: Fun with Flags: Behind the Behind the Flags: A Retrospective Retrospective.\nSheldon: Ooh, we already have our first call.\nAmy: Oh. Hello, you\xe2\x80\x99re on Fun with Flags.\nBert: The Jet Ski worked. I got her back.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
