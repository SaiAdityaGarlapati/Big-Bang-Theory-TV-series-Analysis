b'Scene: The cafeteria.\nLeonard: I was reading about this jellyfish that never dies. Instead, it reverts to its asexual state and then grows up again.\nHoward: We thought my 90-year-old grandfather had reverted to an asexual state, but the lawsuit from his Jamaican caregiver proved us all wrong.\nLeonard: My point is, immortality is not only a possibility, it is real.\nRaj: Only if you\xe2\x80\x99re this jellyfish which periodically reverts to a mass of undifferentiated protoplasm.\nSheldon: If I could keep my Gmail account, I\xe2\x80\x99d be okay with that.\nBarry: \xe2\x80\x93 Hewwo, fewwas.\nAll: Hey.\nBarry: Wemember when we were twying to figuwe out what that smell coming fwom Pwofessor Tupperman\xe2\x80\x99s office was?\nHoward: Yeah?\nBarry: Turns out it was Tupperman. Dead at his desk for two weeks.\nHoward: That\xe2\x80\x99s terrible.\nLeonard: Oh, my God.\nBarry: In wieu of fwowers, the department chair is asking that evewyone donate a bottle of Febweze.\nSheldon: If we\xe2\x80\x99re going to change the topic from jellyfish, I\xe2\x80\x99d be okay with brine shrimp or the history of the unicycle.\nHoward: Show a little compassion, a man died.\nBarry: And turned into a puddew of goo. Now, we can either sit awound and cwy over spilt pwofessor, or we can wejoice in the knowwedge that a tenured position has just opened up. I choose to do the watter.\nSheldon: Excuse me, the whole tenure system is ridiculous. A guaranteed job for life only encourages the faculty to become complacent. If we really want science to advance, people should have chips implanted in their skulls that explode when they say something stupid.\nRaj: Well, I believe people do their best work when they feel safe and secure.\nSheldon: Pchew!\nBarry: If you need my nose, you\xe2\x80\x99ll find it firmwy wodged up the qectum of the tenure committee.\nHoward: You Ph.D\xe2\x80\x99s gonna go suck up like Kripke?\nLeonard: No. I mean, I\xe2\x80\x99ll apply, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not gonna stoop to playing politics.\nRaj: Yeah, me neither. It should be about the work. And if I can\xe2\x80\x99t get tenure, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to see you or Sheldon get it.\nSheldon: Raj, don\xe2\x80\x99t dangle false hope in front of Leonard like that.\nLeonard: Excuse me, but I think I\xe2\x80\x99m just as qualified as you are.\nSheldon: Pchew! Pchew! Pchew! Pchew!\nCredits sequence.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nPenny: So tenured means a job for life?\nLeonard: Yup.\nPenny: You can\xe2\x80\x99t get fired even if you\xe2\x80\x99re bad at it?\nLeonard: Mm, not really.\nPenny: Wow, sounds a lot like being a pretty waitress at the Cheesecake Factory.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: While I disagree with the premise of tenure, if they gave it to me, it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t diminish my output. You know, I\xe2\x80\x99m like the sun. Can\xe2\x80\x99t turn this off.\nAmy: Are Rajesh and Leonard competing for it as well?\nSheldon: Mm-hmm.\nAmy: Do they know they don\xe2\x80\x99t stand a chance \xe2\x80\x99cause you\xe2\x80\x99re so great?\nSheldon: Well put. You know, I must say I go back and forth on this boyfriend-girlfriend thing, but those moments when you worship me really keep you in the running.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nRaj: It would be nice to have the increased income. Stop taking money from my parents.\nHoward: Money from family does come with strings attached.\nRaj: You have no idea. They buy me a new BMW for my birthday but can I get seat warmers? No. Rajesh, if you want a warm butt, you\xe2\x80\x99re gonna have to pay for it yourself. Well, maybe I will, old man.\nBernadette: I think that\xe2\x80\x99s enough wine for now.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nLeonard: I just keep thinking about how cool it would be if I called my mom and told her that I got tenure at Caltech.\nPenny: She\xe2\x80\x99d be proud, huh?\nLeonard: Oh, very. Assuming she takes my call.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: My primary concern with being granted tenure is living with an insanely jealous roommate after the fact. I might need to sleep with a gun under my pillow. Or a chainsaw.\nAmy: Or you take advantage of your newfound economic stability and move out, buy a house, get married. start a family.\nSheldon: Or, the chainsaw.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nRaj: And I will return to New Delhi in triumph atop a bejeweled white elephant. And you know what will be on that elephant\xe2\x80\x99s back? A seat warmer. No, Father, you may not have a ride.\nBernadette: I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna make some coffee.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nPenny: So, who do you have to schmooze to get this deal?\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m not gonna schmooze anybody. I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna let my work speak for itself.\nPenny: That\xe2\x80\x99s great. That shows a lot of integrity.\nLeonard: Thank you. I\xe2\x80\x99m a naive idiot, right?\nPenny: Oh, good, you heard me.\nScene: The apartment.\nAmy: You know, if you really want tenure, maybe you should cozy up to the people making the decision.\nSheldon: Sheldon Cooper does not do cozy.\nAmy: You don\xe2\x80\x99t say.\nSheldon: But I suppose it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t hurt to know who\xe2\x80\x99s on the committee. Let\xe2\x80\x99s see. Oh, Janine Davis. Oh, dear.\nAmy: Is that a problem?\nSheldon: Well\xe2\x80\xa6\n(Flashback to Series 6, Episode 12, The Egg Salad Equivalency)\nSheldon: Even you. You\xe2\x80\x99re a slave.\nJanine: I\xe2\x80\x99m a what?\n(End of flashback)\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure, it could go either way.\nScene: The university gymnasium.\nLeonard: Hey-hey-hey-hey-hey. Mrs. Davis.\nJanine: Hey.\nLeonard: Hey.\nJanine: Dr. Hofstadter.\nLeonard: Yeah. Just thought I\xe2\x80\x99d come down and start getting ready for swimsuit season.\nJanine: Good for you.\nLeonard: Not that you need it. I bet you look great in a swimsuit.\nJanine: Thank you.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99ve got what my father used to call furniture disease. My chest is falling into my drawers. I\xe2\x80\x99m not, uh, familiar with this model. How do I make it start?\nJanine: You push start.\nLeonard: Right. This one might be broken.\nJanine: You have to move.\nLeonard: Got it. Oh. There. Oh, yeah. Yeah, now I\xe2\x80\x99m feeling it. Oh, this is great. I could do this for the rest of my life. Hey, speaking, speaking of things you do for the rest of your life, uh, did I read that you\xe2\x80\x99re on that-that tenure committee?\nJanine: Yep. I got to get a home gym.\nLeonard: Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you have a lot of good applicants, I just wanted to say hi and let you know that I\xe2\x80\x99ll be throwing my hat in the ring.\nJanine: All right, I\xe2\x80\x99ll keep an eye out for that.\nLeonard: Yeah.\nBarry: Hey, Hofstadter. Funny seeing you here for the first time in\xe2\x80\xa6 ever.\nLeonard: Go away.\nBarry: Janine the Machine, wet\xe2\x80\x99s do this!\nJanine: Hey, Barry.\nLeonard: Well, look at that. Burned a whole calorie.\nBarry: I guess you got here ewwy to burn off that banana bwead I baked you.\nJanine: Yeah, it was delicious. Thank you.\nBarry: No, my pweasure.\nLeonard: Oh, if you, if you like banana bread, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a-a great recipe. The trick is in, in fresh ground, I\xe2\x80\x99ll e-mail it to you.\nBarry: Aw wight, I\xe2\x80\x99m warm. Weady to kick it up a notch?\nJanine: Let\xe2\x80\x99s go.\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99s enough cardio for me. I\xe2\x80\x99m just gonna stretch out before I hit the weights.\nJanine: You okay?\nLeonard: Call someone.\nScene: Janine\xe2\x80\x99s office. There is a sound on her computer. It opens up an online video.\nRaj: Good day, Mrs. Davis. This is Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali from the astrophysics department. Don\xe2\x80\x99t be alarmed, I\xe2\x80\x99m not really in space. Anyhoo, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to take this opportunity to tell you about myself, so sit back, relax and enjoy the following 90-minute video.\nJanine: Oh, come on.\nRaj: Born in New Delhi, the third son of an itinerant gynecologist, I showed early signs of genius. At the age of five I discovered a celestial object which later turned out to be the moon.\nShelldon (off): (Knock, knock, knock) Mrs Davis? (Knock, knock, knock) Mrs Davis? (Knock, knock, knock) Mrs Davis?\nJanine: God, they\xe2\x80\x99re everywhere. Come in. Dr. Cooper, how can I help you?\nSheldon: Yes, hello. I\xe2\x80\x99m fine. Um, I understand you may have a bad impression of me, so I bought you a gift.\nJanine: Uh, Dr. Cooper, that\xe2\x80\x99s not necessary.\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s too late. Get ready to like me.\nJanine: Roots?\nSheldon: The tragic history of slavery in America. Fun for the whole family.\nJanine: Why would you think this is an appropriate gift?\nSheldon: Um\xe2\x80\xa6 Well\xe2\x80\xa6 You are black, right?\nJanine: This meeting has come to an end.\nSheldon: Because you want to start watching it right now. Copy that. Let\xe2\x80\x99s see. Up next on the tenure committee is Professor Wu. Well, get ready for the complete works of Jackie Chan.\nScene: The cafeteria.\nLeonard: Gentlemen.\nRaj: Where have you been?\nLeonard: Nurse\xe2\x80\x99s office.\nHoward: Asthma attack?\nLeonard: Asthma, heart, some kind of attack. I\xe2\x80\x99m fine, though.\nHoward: You guys going to Professor Tupperman\xe2\x80\x99s memorial?\nRaj: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\nLeonard: Probably not.\nSheldon: Barely knew him.\nHoward: Yeah, you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to look like you guys are brown-nosing the tenure committee, who will all be there. Oh, yeah, that\xe2\x80\x99s what I was hoping for, meerkats.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: I won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to make our date night this Thursday, so, bad news for you.\nAmy: Well you better have a good excuse this time, because trimming Q-tips to fit your ears right is obvious nonsense.\nSheldon: First of all, when you say things like that, people think you\xe2\x80\x99re crazy. Second, the reason I\xe2\x80\x99m cancelling is because I have to attend a memorial service for Professor Tupperman.\nAmy: It sounds like a long and tedious evening.\nSheldon: Eh, it will be. Honestly, if I must endure a long and tedious evening, I\xe2\x80\x99d rather it be with you on date night. But I have no choice. The tenure committee\xe2\x80\x99s going to be there.\nAmy: Oh. Well, in that case, perhaps I should come along.\nSheldon: Well, now that I think about it, that would be most helpful.\nAmy: Of course it would. I\xe2\x80\x99m well-versed in academic politics, and as a respected scientist, I can only raise your stock as a candidate.\nSheldon: Actually, I meant you could drive me. But if it makes you happy, that other stuff, too.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nLeonard: Do anything interesting today?\nPenny: Oh, not really. I was out shopping with Amy. She wanted me to help her find something for this memorial thing.\nLeonard: Wait, Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s going to be there? We all promised we weren\xe2\x80\x99t going to go.\nPenny: Oh, what a jerk.\nLeonard: I know. I was hoping to go without anyone finding out.\nPenny: Well, since Amy\xe2\x80\x99s going, do you want me there? You know, to support you?\nLeonard: Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s nice, but it-it\xe2\x80\x99s just gonna be a room full of boring old men and I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure how much help you\xe2\x80\x99d be.\nPenny: Okay. I\xe2\x80\x99m just gonna tie my shoe while you think about that.\nLeonard: Oh, yeah. No. Thanks, that would be great help. You realize you might kill some of them.\nPenny: Oh, then you all can get tenure.\nScene: Raj\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nRaj: Come on, Daddy. All the other scientists have seat warmers. This is so humiliating. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to get tenure. Okay, let\xe2\x80\x99s meet halfway. How about I cut my cleaning lady down to twice a week? Looks like we\xe2\x80\x99re both going to be living like animals.\nScene: The memorial.\nAmy: Let\xe2\x80\x99s go over our emotional responses one last time.\nSheldon: Okay.\nAmy: Professor Tupperman is dead, and that makes us?\nSheldon: Sad.\nAmy: The fact that there are so many people here tonight doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make us cranky and claustrophobic. It makes us?\nSheldon: Glad.\nAmy: Giving Mrs. Davis the box set of Roots was?\nSheldon: Bad. However\xe2\x80\xa6\nAmy: No.\nSheldon: Fine. Bad.\nRaj: Unbelievable. You have some nerve showing up here just to schmooze with the tenure committee.\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re here.\nRaj: Excuse me. I\xe2\x80\x99m here to pay my respects to Professor Tupperware, or whatever his name is.\nSheldon: So am I. His passing makes me feel bad.\nLeonard: Well, well, well, Sheldon, fancy meeting you here. I guess the train store in Glendale wasn\xe2\x80\x99t having a cotillion after all. And you, you said you weren\xe2\x80\x99t coming here, either.\nRaj: I have a thick accent. You don\xe2\x80\x99t know what I said.\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99d like to know why Penny\xe2\x80\x99s here.\nPenny: I\xe2\x80\x99m here to support my man, just like you.\nSheldon: What are you going to do? Take people\xe2\x80\x99s drink orders and get them wrong?\nLeonard: Do it.\nSheldon: What? Did she do it yet?\nAmy: She plans on flirting with members of the tenure committee to further Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s cause.\nSheldon: Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s a fine how-do-you-do. Don\xe2\x80\x99t just stand there. Take your breasts out.\nHoward: Ooh, meerkat fight!\nAmy: You\xe2\x80\x99re all wasting your time. Sheldon is the most qualified for the job, and no amount of gravity-defying bosom\xe2\x80\x99s going to change that. Seriously, is that tape? Like, how are they staying up like that?\nLeonard: Way to hit \xe2\x80\x99em with both barrels.\nRaj: You two should be ashamed of yourselves. Using women to advance your cause with sexuality, and whatever Amy plans on doing.\nSheldon: Are you implying that my girlfriend has no sexuality to exploit?\nRaj: Yes.\nSheldon: Okay, because that was not clear.\nAmy: Sheldon!\nSheldon: What? That was ambiguous.\nRaj: Well, now it\xe2\x80\x99s biguous. What are you gonna do about it?\nSheldon: Um\xe2\x80\xa6\nHoward: You could talk some smack about his mother.\nSheldon: Well, yes, of course, he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t like that at all. Last night, I was feeling in need of sexual release when I happened to come across your mother.\nLeonard: Okay, okay. Guys, what are we doing here?\nSheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you\xe2\x80\x99re doing, but I was about to insinuate that I had coitus with Raj\xe2\x80\x99s mother for a dollar.\nLeonard: Oh, you do what you want, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to lose my friends over tenure. Friends are forever.\nHoward: So is tenure.\nBernadette: Walk.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m just gonna go home and let my work speak for itself.\nRaj: You\xe2\x80\x99re right. This is beneath me. Lie your mother was last night.\nLeonard: How about it, Sheldon?\nSheldon: What do you think I should do?\nAmy: Well, you\xe2\x80\x99ll always be an academic success, but I seriously question whether you\xe2\x80\x99ll make any more friends.\nSheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t want any more, but let\xe2\x80\x99s go.\nBarry: Are you kidding? I would wove to baby-sit for you.\nJanine: I could not ask you to do that.\nBarry: Nonsense. Childwen wove me. Something about me just makes them waugh and waugh.\nLeonard: No. We cannot lose to that jerk.\nRaj: Yeah, screw it. I\xe2\x80\x99m going in.\nSheldon: Wait. Hold on. I believe screw it, I\xe2\x80\x99m going in is what I said to your mother last night. Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t really say that. I find the concept of coitus ridiculous and off-putting.\nAmy: Should have taken my breasts out while I had the chance.\nScene: Janine\xe2\x80\x99s office.\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Mrs Davis? (Knock, knock, knock) Mrs Davis? (Knock, knock, knock) Mrs Davis? I know you\xe2\x80\x99re in there. I saw your car in the parking lot.\nJanine: What?\nSheldon: I just found out that you recommended myself, Dr. Hofstadter and Dr. Koothrappali to be on the short list for tenure.\nJanine: Well, despite your quirks, the three of you are very accomplished in your respective fields.\nSheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you mean by quirks, but, um, I do want to express my gratitude.\nJanine: You didn\xe2\x80\x99t bring another gift, did you?\nSheldon: No, no. No, I learned my lesson. I understand that was inappropriate.\nJanine: Good.\nSheldon: Anyway, thank you.\nJanine: You\xe2\x80\x99re welcome. (Sheldon attempts a jive handshake) I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna pretend that didn\xe2\x80\x99t happen.\nSheldon: Yeah, right on, sister.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
