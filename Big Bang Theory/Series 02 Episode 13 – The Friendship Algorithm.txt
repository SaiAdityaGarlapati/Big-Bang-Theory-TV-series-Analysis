b'Scene: The university cafeteria\nRaj: Mmm, gentlemen, I put it to you, the worst tapioca pudding is better than the best pudding of any other flavour.\nSheldon: First off, that is axiomatically wrong, because the best pudding is chocolate. Secondly, the organic structure of tapioca makes it a jiggling bowl of potential death. It is extracted from the plant\xe2\x80\xa6\nHoward: Hey, I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking of growing a mustache.\nLeonard: Ah, no kidding! A Fu Man Chu? A handlebar pencil?\nSheldon: It is extracted from the plant\xe2\x80\xa6\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure yet. You know, George Clooney has one now!\nRaj: Really? I once saw him shopping at Ralph\xe2\x80\x99s. He was buying tequila.\nHoward: Oh, you\xe2\x80\x99d think a guy like that would have some kind of booze lackey.\nLeonard: Alright this is cruel, we better let him finish before his head explodes.\nHoward: Alright Sheldon, why is tapioca\xe2\x80\xa6\nSheldon: Tapioca is extracted from the root of the plant Manihot Esculenta. Due to a high concentration of cyanide it is poisonous in its raw form and lethal if prepared improperly.\nRaj: Feel better now?\nSheldon: It is also indigenous to Brazil, as is the Cocoa Bean, from which we get chocolate, the best pudding. And you promised you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do that anymore!\nKripke (arriving): Hey Hofstadter!\nLeonard: Hey Kripke.\nKripke: Heard about your watest pwoton decay expewiment, twenty thousand data wuns and no statistically significant wesults. Vewy impwessive!\nHoward: What a jerk.\nRaj: Don\xe2\x80\x99t feel bad Leonard, negative results are still results.\nHoward: Even twenty thousand of \xe2\x80\x99em.\nLeonard: Alright, please don\xe2\x80\x99t cheer me up anymore.\nHoward: C\xe2\x80\x99mon, don\xe2\x80\x99t let him get to you. It\xe2\x80\x99s Kripke.\nRaj: Yeah, he\xe2\x80\x99s a ginormous knob.\nHoward: That\xe2\x80\x99s why he eats by himself, instead of sitting here at the cool table.\nRaj: Fo\xe2\x80\x99 shizzle.\nSheldon: Hey it\xe2\x80\x99s true, Kripke lacks the basic social skills that we take for granted, but he also controls the new open science grid computer that I need to use to run some simulations of structure formation in the early universe.\nLeonard: Good luck getting time on it. The only people he lets use it are his friends.\nSheldon: Well then, the solution is simple. I shall befriend him. Kripke!\nKripke: Yeah?\nSheldon: What\xe2\x80\x99d you say of the idea of you and I becoming friends?\nKripke: I would say, I have no intewest in becoming your fwiend.\nSheldon: Really? That seems rather short sighted, coming from someone who is generally considered altogether unlikable. Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you take some time to reconsider?\nKripke: Yeah, I\xe2\x80\x99ll do that.\nSheldon: Well I think we\xe2\x80\x99re off to a terrific start.\nCredits sequence.\n  Scene: The apartment.\nLeonard: There you go. Now any e-mail from Wolowitz will go right into your spam folder.\nPenny: Thanks! I mean the e-mail doesn\xe2\x80\x99t bother me as much as the vacation pictures of him in a bathing suit.\nLeonard: Yeah, I got the same one. And that\xe2\x80\x99s not a bathing suit, it\xe2\x80\x99s a tan line.\nSheldon (on phone): Hello. This is Sheldon Cooper. I\xe2\x80\x99m leaving a message for Barry Kripke. Barry, It was pleasant seeing you today in the cafeteria. I saw that you purchased the chef\xe2\x80\x99s salad. Apparently, you did not know that the chef\xe2\x80\x99s salad is kitchen trickery, to utilize scrap meat. Nevertheless, I hope you enjoyed it. I\xe2\x80\x99m following up on our pending friendship, and I look forward to hearing from you regarding its status. Sheldon Cooper.\nPenny: What\xe2\x80\x99s up with Ichabod?\nLeonard: Oh he\xe2\x80\x99s trying to make a new friend.\nPenny: Oh really? Well, good for him.\nLeonard: Well, unless he\xe2\x80\x99s makes one out of wood like Gepetto, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s gonna happen.\nPenny: Well, how did you guys become friends?\nLeonard: There was a flier on the bulletin board at the university. Roommate wanted. Whistlers need not apply.\nPenny: And you moved in anyway?\nLeonard: I assumed he was joking. You\xe2\x80\x99d be surprised how many particle physicists have a whimsical side.\nPenny: Well, what about Howard and Raj, I mean how did you become friends with them?\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, how do carbon atoms form a benzene ring? Proximity and valence electrons.\nPenny: Well yeah, sure. When you put it that way. But it all worked out, right?\nLeonard: I suppose. I do miss whistling though.\nPenny: Oh come on, really? (Leonard whistles)\nSheldon: First warning.\nScene: Outside Penny\xe2\x80\x99s door.\n  Sheldon (Knock, knock, knock) : Penny (knock, knock, knock) Penny (knock, knock, knock) Penny.This is for you.\nPenny: Hello Sheldon.\nSheldon: Hi.\nPenny: What is this?\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s a questionnaire I devised. I\xe2\x80\x99m having some difficulty bonding with a colleague at work, so I\xe2\x80\x99m doing a little research to better understand why my current friends like me.\nPenny: Yes. Well, that is a good question. But is this really the best way to figure it out?\nSheldon: Yeah, I agree, the social sciences are largely hokum. But, short of putting electrodes in your brain and monitoring your response to my companionship, this is the best I can do.\nPenny: Okay, question 1. Rank the following aspects of Sheldon Cooper in order of appeal. Intelligence. Ruthless attention to hygiene. Playfulness. Java applet writing?\nSheldon: I know, I may have started off with a fairly obvious one. You did an aspect of my most appealing trait, playfulness. Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you just go ahead and write that number 1. I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid you\xe2\x80\x99re on your own for the rest. It should take you no more than 3 hours.\nPenny: Wait! How many questions are on this thing?\nSheldon: Only 211. Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry, in deference to you, I\xe2\x80\x99ve kept them on a high school graduate reading level.\nPenny: Thanks pal.\nSheldon: You got it, buddy.\nPenny: Sheldon honey, did you ever consider making friends by being, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, pleasant?\nSheldon: Well that\xe2\x80\x99s certainly a thought-provoking hypothesis. May I suggest it as the topic for your essay.\nScene: The apartment. Sheldon is reading one of the questionnaires. He tuts.\nSheldon: Your questionnaire, very disappointing.\nLeonard: I answered every question Sheldon.\nSheldon: You answered the multiple choice questions in a pattern. A B B A C. A B B A C.\nLeonard: Aw, you picked up on that huh?\nSheldon: How could I not?\nLeonard: Come on! There\xe2\x80\x99s over 200 questions. And look at some of these things. Sheldon is to camaraderie, as the space shuttle is to blank?\nSheldon: There are a number of acceptable answers, for example, C: near earth transport, but certainly not B: avocado rancher. And your essay, suggesting that I\xe2\x80\x99d have better luck making friends if I wait \xe2\x80\x99til the Cylons take over? Please.\nLeonard: Hold on. I put some real work into that!\nSheldon: Yes, well it\xe2\x80\x99s better than what Wolowitz did. He drew a raccoon with what appears to be, a distended scrotum.\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s kinda cute, until you get to the scrotum.\nSheldon: What hope do I have for establishing new relationships given that my current friends apparently cannot take a few hours out of their lives to help me?\nLeonard: Sheldon, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to defend a big-balled raccoon.\nSheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t see how you could.\nLeonard: What I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to say is that, maybe you can\xe2\x80\x99t approach this as a purely intellectual exercise.\nSheldon: What do you mean!?\nLeonard: Well, remember when you tried to learn how to swim using the internet?\nSheldon: I did learn how to swim.\nLeonard: On the floor.\nSheldon: The skills are transferrable. I just have no interest in going in the water.\nLeonard: Then why learn how to swim?\nSheldon: The ice caps are melting Leonard. In the future, swimming isn\xe2\x80\x99t going to be optional. But you do bring up an interesting point. I don\xe2\x80\x99t have to break new ground here, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure much of the research already exists.\nLeonard: No! no, my point is, if you want to learn how to make friends, then just go out to a coffee shop or a museum. Meet people. Talk to them. Take an interest in their lives.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s insane on the face of it. Come on.\nLeonard: Where are we going?\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re driving me to the mall. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to acquire a book that summarizes the current theories in the field of friendmaking.\nLeonard: Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you just lie down on the floor and swim there?\nScene: A bookshop.\n  Sheldon: Coping with the death of a loved one. My condolences.\nWoman in queue: Thank you.\nSheldon: Family or friend?\nWoman: Family.\nSheldon: Too bad. If it\xe2\x80\x99d been a friend, I\xe2\x80\x99m available to fill the void. (Woman moves away) It\xe2\x80\x99s just as well, she smelled like moth balls.\nLeonard: Okay, if you\xe2\x80\x99re gonna start sniffing people, I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna go get a hot pretzel.\nSheldon: Excuse me. Do you have any books about making friends?\nBookstore employee: Um, yeah but they\xe2\x80\x99re all for little kids.\nSheldon: I assume the skills can be extrapolated and transferred.\nEmployee: Uh, I guess. They\xe2\x80\x99re right over there by the wooden train set.\nSheldon: Oh! I love trains!\nEmployee: I bet you do.\nSheldon (picks up train): Oh my! That\xe2\x80\x99s awfully sticky. Alright, let\xe2\x80\x99s see. Bernie Bunny has Two Daddies Now. It\xe2\x80\x99s probably about homosexual rabbits. Jerry the Gerbil and the Bullies on the Bus. Read it, not helpful. Oh! Here we go. Stu the Cockatoo is New at the Zoo. Author Sarah Carpenter lives in Fort Wayne, Indiana, with her husband and best friend Mark, and their cockatoos too. Hardly makes her an expert in making friends, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you agree?\nLittle girl: I don\xe2\x80\x99t like birds, they scare me.\nSheldon: Me too! Most people don\xe2\x80\x99t see it. What are you reading?\nGirl: Curious George.\nSheldon: Oh I do like monkeys!\nGirl: Curious George is a monkey.\nSheldon: Somewhat anthropomorphized but yes. Say, maybe sometime you and I can go see monkeys together. Would you like that?\nGirl: Okay.\nLeonard: Sheldon, what are you doing?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m making friends with this little girl. What\xe2\x80\x99s your name?\nGirl: Rebecca.\nSheldon: Hi Rebecca, I\xe2\x80\x99m your new friend, Sheldon.\nLeonard: No you\xe2\x80\x99re not, let\xe2\x80\x99s go.\nSheldon: We were really hitting it off.\nLeonard: Don\xe2\x80\x99t look up, there\xe2\x80\x99s cameras.\nScene: The stairwell.\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99m curious. In the \xe2\x80\x9cHow Well Do You Know Sheldon\xe2\x80\x9d section, what do you put for his favourite amino acid?\nLeonard and Howard: Lysine.\nRaj: Damn it. I had Lysine and changed it.\nSheldon: Oh good! You\xe2\x80\x99re just in time. I believe I\xe2\x80\x99ve isolated the algorithm for making friends.\nLeonard: Sheldon, there is no algorithm for making friends!\nHoward: Hear him out. If he\xe2\x80\x99s really on to something, we can open a booth at Comic-Con, make a fortune.\nSheldon: See, my initial approach to Kripke, had the same deficiencies as those that plagued Stu the Cockatoo, when he was new at the zoo.\nRaj: Stu the cockatoo?\nLeonard: Yes, he\xe2\x80\x99s new at the zoo.\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s a terrific book. I\xe2\x80\x99ve distilled its essence into a simple flowchart that would guide me through the process.\nHoward: Have you thought about putting him in a crate while you\xe2\x80\x99re out of the apartment?\nSheldon (on phone): Hello, Kripke. Yes, Sheldon Cooper here. It occurred to me you hadn\xe2\x80\x99t returned any of my calls because I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t offered any concrete suggestions for pursuing our friendship. Perhaps the two of us might share a meal together\xe2\x80\xa6 I see. Well then perhaps you\xe2\x80\x99d have time for a hot beverage. Popular choices include tea, coffee, cocoa\xe2\x80\xa6 I see. No, no, no, wait. Don\xe2\x80\x99t hang up yet. What about a recreational activity? I bet we share some common interests. Tell me an interest of yours. Really? On actual horses? Tell me another interest of yours. Oh no, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, I have no desire to get in the water until I absolutely have to. Tell me another interest of yours.\nLeonard: Uh-oh, he\xe2\x80\x99s stuck in an infinite loop.\nHoward: I can fix it.\nSheldon: Mmhmm. Mmhmm. It\xe2\x80\x99s interesting. But isn\xe2\x80\x99t ventriloquism, by definition, a solo activity? Yeah? Tell me another interest of yours. Hmmm. Is there any chance you like monkeys? What is wrong with you? Everybody likes monkeys. Hang on, Kripke. (Checking changes Howard has made to his flowchart) A loop counter? And an escape to the least objectionable activity! Howard, that\xe2\x80\x99s brilliant! I\xe2\x80\x99m surprised you saw that.\nHoward: Gee. Why can\xe2\x80\x99t Sheldon make friends?\nSheldon: Alright Kripke, that last interest strikes me as the least objectionable and I would like to propose that we do that together. Tomorrow. Yes, I\xe2\x80\x99ll pay. Alright, goodbye. Alright! Time to learn rock climbing.\nScene: Rock climbing centre. Sheldon and Kripke are watching someone descend the practice wall.\nSheldon: You know, I am a fan of ventriloquism. Maybe you, me and your dummy could go get a hot beverage. He could talk while you drink.\nKripke: Nope, I wanna climb some wocks.\nSheldon: This appears significantly more monolithic than it did on my laptop. No, one expects to see Hominids learning to use bones as weapeons.\nKripke: You afwaid of heights, Cooper?\nSheldon: Hardly. Fear of heights is illogical. Fear of falling, on the other hand, is prudent and evolutionary. What would you say is the minimum altitude I need to achieve to cement our new-found friendship?\nKripke: Come on, they have birthday parties here. Wittle kids climb this.\nSheldon: Little kid Hominids, perhaps. (To man who attaches him to ropes) Is this your entire job? Your parents must be so proud.\nKripke: Let\xe2\x80\x99s go, Cooper.\nSheldon: Coming, Kripke. Okay. Harness seems to be secure. Small amount of incontinence just now, but the website said that\xe2\x80\x99s to be expected. Hey, this isn\xe2\x80\x99t so bad. A bit like vertical swimming.\nKripke: Hey, look at you, Cooper. You\xe2\x80\x99re almost halfway to the top.\nSheldon: I am? I was wrong. It IS a fear of heights.\nKripke:You alwight there, Cooper?\nSheldon: Not really. I feel somewhat like an inverse tangent function that\xe2\x80\x99s approaching an asymptote.\nKripke: Are you saying you\xe2\x80\x99re stuck?\nSheldon: What part of an inverse tangent function approaching an asymptote did you not understand?\nKripke: Understood all that. I\xe2\x80\x99m not a mowon. Just keep going.\nSheldon: Yeah, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I can.\nKripke: Well, then. Cwimb back down.\nSheldon: No, that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem any more likely.\nKripke: So what\xe2\x80\x99s the pwan, Cooper?\nSheldon: Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s not exactly a plan but I think I\xe2\x80\x99m going to pass out.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. Can we please just do it one more time?\nHoward: Okay. 1, 2, 1, 2, 3 and\xe2\x80\xa6 (Leonard, Howard and Raj whistle \xe2\x80\x9cSweet Georgia Brown\xe2\x80\x9d together)\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s a little thing but you really do miss it.\nSheldon: Hello, everyone. I brought my new friend, Barry Kripke, home for dinner.\nTogether: Oh\xe2\x80\xa6\nKripke: Hewo to you, too.\nLeonard: How was rock climbing?\nKripke: He passed out. Just hung there like a big sawami.\nSheldon: D-d-d! That\xe2\x80\x99s where I sit.\nKripke: Ooh, you have a special spot. What kind of wacko are you?\nHoward: How much time you got?\nLeonard: Want some Chinese food?\nKripke: Tewific. Got any dental fwoss?\nLeonard: In the bathroom.\nKripke: Be right back. I gotta fwoss the Indian food out of my teeth if I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna eat Chinese.\nPenny: Sheldon, are you okay?\nSheldon: Oh yes, I pass out all the time. But, it was worth it. I\xe2\x80\x99ve made substantial progress in bonding with Kripke, which brings me to an awkward moment.\nLeonard: What\xe2\x80\x99s that?\nSheldon: Maintaining five friendships promises to be a Herculean task. So, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to have to let one of you go.\nHoward: Me, me. Let it be me.\nSheldon: Leonard, you are my roommate, my source of transportation and you help me fold my sheets when they come out of the dryer. You are safe.\nLeonard: Can I whistle?\nSheldon: Don\xe2\x80\x99t be silly. Howard, you do not have a PhD, your cologne is an assault on the senses and you\xe2\x80\x99re not available for video games during the Jewish high holidays.\nHoward: Guilty as charged. I\xe2\x80\x99m out.\nSheldon: No. You, too, are safe.\nHoward: Oh come on. What do I have to do?\nPenny: Okay. You know what? I see where this is going. I\xe2\x80\x99m not one of you guys. I\xe2\x80\x99m not a scientist. So just\xe2\x80\xa6\nSheldon: Penny, Penny, Penny. Everything you\xe2\x80\x99re saying is true, but please allow me to continue. Raj, you\xe2\x80\x99re out. The good question, while you do provide a certain cultural diversity to an otherwise homogenous group, your responses to the questionnaire were truly disturbing. How could you, for a moment, think that my favourite amino acid is Glutamine?\nLeonard: He had Lysine but changed it.\nSheldon: Yeah. Shoulda, woulda coulda, Raj.\nKripke: I like to fwoss before I eat, so my gum pockets are open for new food.\nPenny: Eww.\nKripke: Hewo. How did I walk past you? I\xe2\x80\x99m Bawy.\nPenny: Penny.\nKripke: Yeah, it\xe2\x80\x99s not a vewy hot name. I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna call your Woxanne. Ooh, pot stickers.\nHoward: Suddenly I\xe2\x80\x99m looking pretty good, huh?\nSheldon: So uh, Kripke, I was wondering if there\xe2\x80\x99s any chance you could get me some time on the open science grid computer.\nKripke: No.\nSheldon: No? But we\xe2\x80\x99re friends!\nKripke: I\xe2\x80\x99m sowy. No, my fwiend?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m confused. I was given an understanding that you allow your friends time on the machine?\nKripke: No, that\xe2\x80\x99s wong. There\xe2\x80\x99s an official schedule. I have no contwol over it.\nSheldon: Oh. This entire endeavour seems to have been an exercise in futility. Raj, you\xe2\x80\x99re back in. He likes monkeys.\nScene: The climbing centre.\nHoward: You gotta give him credit for sticking with it.\nLeonard: I didn\xe2\x80\x99t think he had it in him.\nRaj: He almost made it to the top this time.\nSheldon is seen dangling from the ropes\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
