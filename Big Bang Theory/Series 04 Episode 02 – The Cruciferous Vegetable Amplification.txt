b'Scene: The apartment. Sheldon has a series of whiteboards across the room.\nLeonard: Whatcha doin\xe2\x80\x99 there? Working on a new plan to catch the roadrunner?\nSheldon: The humorous implication being that I am Wile E. Coyote?\nLeonard: Yes.\nSheldon: And this is a schematic for a bird-trapping device that will ultimately backfire and cause me physical injury?\nLeonard: Yes.\nSheldon: What I\xe2\x80\x99m doing here is trying to determine when I\xe2\x80\x99m going to die.\nLeonard: A lot of people are working on that research. So what is all this?\nSheldon: My family history factoring in longevity, propensity for disease, et cetera.\nLeonard: Interesting. Cause of death for Uncle Carl was KBB. What\xe2\x80\x99s KBB?\nSheldon: Killed by badger.\nLeonard: How\xe2\x80\x99s that?\nSheldon: It was Thanksgiving. Uncle Carl said, I think there\xe2\x80\x99s a badger living in our chimney. Hand me that flashlight. Those were the last words he ever spoke to us.\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you need to worry about death by badgers being hereditary.\nSheldon: Not true. The fight or flight instinct is coded genetically. Instead of fleeing, he chose to fight barehanded against a brawny member of the weasel family. Who\xe2\x80\x99s to say that I don\xe2\x80\x99t share that flawed DNA?\nLeonard: You can always get a badger and find out.\nSheldon: But seriously, even if I disregard the Uncle Carl factor, at best I have 60 years left.\nLeonard: That long, huh?\nSheldon: 60 only takes me to here. I need to get to here.\nLeonard: What\xe2\x80\x99s there?\nSheldon: The earliest estimate of the singularity, when man will be able to transfer his consciousness into machines and achieve immortality.\nLeonard: So, you\xe2\x80\x99re upset about missing out on becoming some sort of freakish self-aware robot?\nSheldon: By this much.\nLeonard: Tough break. You want eggs?\nSheldon: You don\xe2\x80\x99t get it, Leonard. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to miss so much, the unified field theory,  cold fusion, the dogapus.\nLeonard: What\xe2\x80\x99s a dogapus?\nSheldon: A hybrid dog and octopus. Man\xe2\x80\x99s underwater best friend.\nLeonard: Is somebody working on that?\nSheldon: I was going to. I planned on giving it to myself on my 300th birthday.\nLeonard: Wait a minute. You hate dogs.\nSheldon: A dogapus can play fetch with eight balls. No one can hate that.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The apartment.\nHoward: What do we owe you?\nLeonard: It came to $28.17. Let\xe2\x80\x99s say six bucks apiece.\nHoward: Here you go.\nLeonard: Thank you.\nPenny: What?\nLeonard: Never mind. I got it.\nPenny: Oh, you wanted me to pay.\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s no big deal.\nPenny: No, no, no, no. You\xe2\x80\x99re right. We\xe2\x80\x99re not going out anymore, I should pay for myself. (After Raj whispers to Howard, and Howard laughs) What?\nHoward: He said if he had woman parts, he\xe2\x80\x99d eat for free the rest of his life.\nPenny: Yeah, but you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be able to talk to yourself. I\xe2\x80\x99m a little low on cash.\nLeonard: Hmm? How much you got?\nPenny: Nothing.\nLeonard: How can you walk around with no money?\nPenny: I\xe2\x80\x99m cute. I get by.\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s okay, you can owe me.\nPenny: Okay.\nLeonard: Sheldon, six bucks.\nSheldon: No, thank you. I\xe2\x80\x99m not eating pizza tonight.\nPenny: But it\xe2\x80\x99s Thursday. Thursday\xe2\x80\x99s pizza night.\nSheldon: Not for me. Thursday is now Cruciferous Vegetable Night. Tonight\xe2\x80\x99s selection, brussels sprouts.\nHoward: Really? You\xe2\x80\x99re changing the Sheldonian calendar?\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s a small price to pay.\nPenny: For what?\nLeonard: No, no, don\xe2\x80\x99t ask.\nPenny: Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.\nSheldon: In order to live long enough to fuse my consciousness with cybernetics, I need to change my diet.\nPenny: Wait. Cybernetics is robot stuff, right?\nSheldon: Correct.\nPenny: So you want to turn yourself into some sort of robot?\nSheldon: Essentially, yes.\nPenny: Okay, here\xe2\x80\x99s my question. Didn\xe2\x80\x99t you already do that?\nSheldon: Flattering, but sadly, no. I\xe2\x80\x99m also planning to begin an exercise regimen designed to strengthen my cardiovascular system. AKA jogging.\nPenny: Wait. Honey,have you ever run before?\nSheldon: Certainly. I\xe2\x80\x99ve run from bullies, dogs, angry chickens, and one particularly persistent P.E. teacher determined to bend me over and give me a scoliosis test.\nHoward (after Raj whispers to him): You\xe2\x80\x99re right, Penny jogs. Maybe you guys can run together.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s an excellent idea. Yeah, if we chat, it will create the illusion of time going faster.\nPenny: No, it won\xe2\x80\x99t. Um, how does he know I jog?\nHoward: Oh, he watches you from his car with high-powered binoculars.\nPenny: Oh, my God, that is so creepy!\nHoward: I know! (Raj whispers to him) And he says he\xe2\x80\x99s not gonna stop. (Raj whispers to him urgently) Then see a shrink and figure out how to talk to women.\nScene: Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom\nSheldon (off): (Knock, knock, knock) Ugh. (Knock, knock, knock) U-u-ugh. (Knock, knock, knock) Lenu-u-ugh.\nLeonard: What the hell? What\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\nSheldon: I have pain radiating from my navel to my lower right abdomen. I\xe2\x80\x99m nauseated and feverish. I believe I may have cholera.\nLeonard: There\xe2\x80\x99s no cholera in Pasadena. Just like last summer, when there was no malaria in Pasadena.\nSheldon: Well, if it\xe2\x80\x99s not cholera, then based on a quick Internet search, the other explanations in decreasing order of likelihood are Hirschsprung\xe2\x80\x99s Disease, botulism, a 30-foot tapeworm or accidental ingestion of chrysanthemum blossoms.\nLeonard: When would you have accidentally eaten chrysanthemum blossoms?\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s part of an unlikely scenario that involves sleepwalking and a 24-hour flower mart with a less-than-vigilant proprietor. Oh, Lord, my belly!\nLeonard: Have you had your appendix out?\nSheldon: I haven\xe2\x80\x99t. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been meaning to, but who has the time?\nLeonard: Let\xe2\x80\x99s get you to the hospital.\nSheldon: So this is how it ends, with cruel irony. Just as I make the commitment to preserving my body, I am betrayed by my appendix, a vestigial organ. Do you know the original purpose of the appendix, Leonard?\nLeonard: No.\nSheldon: I do. And yet I\xe2\x80\x99m doomed while you live on.\nLeonard: Funny how things work out, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\nSheldon: Oh, Lord, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s about to burst! (Loud sound of farting) On the other hand, it might have been the Brussels sprouts.\nLeonard: Good night.\nSheldon: Good night. Appendicitis. What a nervous Nelly.\nScene: The hallway.\n  Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny.\nPenny: Coming, coming. Hey, nice knees.\nSheldon: Thank you. They\xe2\x80\x99re my mother\xe2\x80\x99s.\nPenny: Oh. And the Flash shirt is what? Because you\xe2\x80\x99re gonna run really fast?\nSheldon: No, the Flash shirt is because it\xe2\x80\x99s Friday, but it\xe2\x80\x99s nice when things work out. Where\xe2\x80\x99s your heart rate monitor?\nPenny: I don\xe2\x80\x99t have one.\nSheldon: What about your pedometer?\nPenny: Don\xe2\x80\x99t have one.\nSheldon: Do you have telematics in your shoes connected to an iPod?\nPenny: Uh, no.\nSheldon: What do you do, you just go out there and gambol about like a bunny?\nPenny: No. I just run till I\xe2\x80\x99m hungry, then I stop for a bear claw.\nSheldon: Why are you doing that?\nPenny: It\xe2\x80\x99s good to stretch your muscles before you run.\nSheldon: All right.\nPenny: All right, let\xe2\x80\x99s start with a toe touch. Okay, you do it.\nSheldon: I am doing it.\nPenny: Oh. Wow. Good job. Okay, um, can you do this?\nSheldon: We\xe2\x80\x99ll never know.\nPenny: Okay, let\xe2\x80\x99s just warm up on the run.\nSheldon: Okay.\nPenny: Okay, let\xe2\x80\x99s go.\nSheldon: Yeah, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been reading up on biomechanics. I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll be surprised at my\xe2\x80\xa6 Wah! Oh!\nPenny (squealing): Oh, my God, are you okay?\nSheldon: I think so.\nPenny: Oh, let me help you up.\nSheldon: Thank you. (Loud sound of farting)\nPenny: Oh, Sheldon!\nSheldon: If it makes you feel any better, Thursday is no longer Cruciferous Vegetable Night.\nScene: The apartment.\n  Leonard: Here\xe2\x80\x99s my chicken curry. Howard, your shrimp biryani.\nHoward: Thank you, sir.\nLeonard: Palak paneer, that\xe2\x80\x99s Penny.\nPenny: Thanks.\nLeonard: And for Rajesh Koothrappali, from whose homeland these tasty dishes originate, one large order of chicken McNuggets.\nPenny: Hey, what\xe2\x80\x99s my share?\nLeonard: Uh, 12 bucks.\nPenny: Okay, can I get you after Friday when I get paid?\nLeonard: Sure.\nPenny: What am I up to now?\nLeonard: Well, okay, with the Indian food, the pizza, the Thai food, the tank of gas, the frozen yogurt and your rent, uh, a little over fourteen hundred dollars.\nPenny (after Raj whispers to Howard and they both laugh): What now?\nHoward: He\xe2\x80\x99s just expressing his admiration that you don\xe2\x80\x99t even have to put out to get free stuff.\nPenny: It\xe2\x80\x99s not free, I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna pay him back. (Raj whispers. Both laugh again) Shut up!\nLeonard: Sheldon, are you gonna join us?\nSheldon: Coming! (From the bedroom area, a wheeled device consisting of a base, a tee-shirt on a coat hanger, and a computer monitor with Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s face, appears). Greetings, friends.\nLeonard: Greetings, whatever the hell you are.\nSheldon-bot: I am a mobile virtual presence device. Recent events have demonstrated to me that my body is too fragile to endure the vicissitudes of the world. Until such time as I am able to transfer my consciousness, I shall remain in a secure location and interact with the world in this manner.\nHoward (after Raj whispers to him): Really? That\xe2\x80\x99s your question? When did he put a ramp in?\nSheldon-bot: You\xe2\x80\x99re in my spot. This may seem a little odd at first, but over time you\xe2\x80\x99ll grow accustomed to dealing with me in this configuration.\nPenny: Yeah, to be honest, I don\xe2\x80\x99t see much difference.\nSheldon-bot: Thank you. That\xe2\x80\x99s what I was going for. Now, Leonard, tomorrow, when we go to work, you\xe2\x80\x99ll need to allow some extra time to get me down the stairs. For your convenience, I disassemble into four pieces.\nLeonard: This is ridiculous. I\xe2\x80\x99m coming to talk to you.\nSheldon-bot: You don\xe2\x80\x99t know where I am. My physical body is safely ensconced in a secure, undisclosed location.\nLeonard: You\xe2\x80\x99re in your bedroom.\nSheldon-bot: No, I\xe2\x80\x99m not.\nLeonard: I can hear your voice coming from your bedroom.\nSheldon-bot: No, you can\xe2\x80\x99t. Wait. Come back. Halt. Authorized personnel only!\nPenny: So, either one of you weirdos want to buy my underwear? Only fourteen hundred bucks.\nScene: Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom.\nLeonard: Sheldon, this is ridiculous.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m behind you. Please look at me when you\xe2\x80\x99re talking to me.\nLeonard: I am looking at you.\nSheldon: No, you\xe2\x80\x99re not. Pay no attention to that man in the bed.\nLeonard: You cannot exist as a virtual presence. Not here and certainly not at work. Oh, good God.\nSheldon: At my age, do you know how I\xe2\x80\x99m statistically most likely to die?\nLeonard: At the hands of your roommate?\nSheldon: An accident.\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99s how I\xe2\x80\x99m going to make it look.\nSheldon: Until I can transfer my intellect to a more durable container, my body will remain safely ensconced in my bed.\nLeonard: Fine, but don\xe2\x80\x99t expect my help.\nSheldon: You have to help, it\xe2\x80\x99s in the roommate agreement.\nLeonard: No, it\xe2\x80\x99s not.\nSheldon: Section 74.C. The various obligations and duties of the parties in the event one of them becomes a robot.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99ll be damned.\nScene: Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s car\nSheldon-bot: This is delightful.\nLeonard: Uh-huh.\nSheldon-bot: It\xe2\x80\x99s much easier to enjoy the picturesque route we travel to work when you remove the spectre of fiery vehicular death.\nLeonard: Refresh my memory. Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t I just put you in the trunk?\nSheldon-bot: Because I called shotgun. Remember?\nLeonard: Right.\nSheldon-bot: You seem tense. Perhaps this will relax you.\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to listen to music, Sheldon.\nSheldon-bot: Very well. I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand why you\xe2\x80\x99re not enjoying this. Together, in this car, with my enhanced capabilities, we\xe2\x80\x99re like Knight Rider.\nLeonard: Except in Knight Rider, the car isn\xe2\x80\x99t a yammering sphincter.\nSheldon-bot: You mock the sphincter, but the sphincter is a class of muscle without which human beings couldn\xe2\x80\x99t survive. There are over 50 different sphincters in the human body. How many can you name?\nLeonard: I was wrong, this is exactly like Knight Rider.\nSheldon-bot: Perhaps you\xe2\x80\x99d be interested in a different game.\nLeonard: No.\nSheldon-bot: This is a photograph of the 1911 Solvay Conference on the theory of radiation and quanta. Using Photoshop, I\xe2\x80\x99ve introduced a few anachronisms. See if you can spot all 24. I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the first one. Madame Curie should not be wearing a digital watch. And go.\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99s it. Bye-bye. (Turns off screen.)\nSheldon-bot (screen switching itself back on): Bazinga.\nLeonard: Whoa!\nSheldon-bot: I have an override switch.\nLeonard: I almost died!\nSheldon-bot : And I\xe2\x80\x99m safe and sound in bed. Who\xe2\x80\x99s crazy now?\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m still going to go with you.\nScene: A corridor at the university.\nSheldon-bot : Hello, Professor Hoskins. Nice to see you, Mindy. Konichi-wa Dr. Nakamora. Sorry the Swedes disproved your theory. Leonard, my door.\nLeonard: What about it?\nSheldon-bot : Be a lamb and open it for me.\nLeonard: Why? What\xe2\x80\x99s the problem?\nSheldon-bot : You think you have me stymied, don\xe2\x80\x99t you?\nLeonard: No, I think a doorknob has you stymied.\nHoward: Oh, look, it\xe2\x80\x99s Leonard and R2-D-Bag.\nRaj: That\xe2\x80\x99s my joke. I told it last night. You can\xe2\x80\x99t just use it.\nSheldon-bot : Raj, be a lamb and open the door for me.\nRaj: Oh, sure.\nSheldon-bot : He\xe2\x80\x99s a lamb. You\xe2\x80\x99re not.\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99m a lamb.\nScene: The Cheesecake Factory\nSheldon-bot : Isn\xe2\x80\x99t this nice? The pleasures of fellowship and camaraderie without having to tolerate your germy breath on my skin.\nHoward: I say we just take him to Tatooine and sell him to some Jawas.\nRaj: That\xe2\x80\x99s two, dude. Write your own jokes.\nPenny: Oh, great. Hi, I\xe2\x80\x99m Penny, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be your waitress.\nLeonard: Why are you introducing yourself?\nPenny: I\xe2\x80\x99d rather people not know I have any prior connection to you whatsoever.\nSheldon-bot : Can you tell me the specials this evening?\nPenny: Sheldon, I\xe2\x80\x99m not waiting on you.\nSheldon-bot: Obviously. I don\xe2\x80\x99t even have water yet.\nPenny: Because you\xe2\x80\x99re not here.\nSheldon-bot: That\xe2\x80\x99s discrimination against the otherwise located. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to have to go over your head. Manager, manager. Oh, Lord, look who it is.\nHoward: Is that Steve Wozniak?\nLeonard: I think it is.\nSheldon-bot : The Great and Powerful Woz.\nLeonard: Penny, Steve Wozniak was one of the cofounders of Apple Computer. He and Steve Jobs started it\xe2\x80\xa6\nPenny: Yeah, I know who he is. I watch Dancing with the Stars.\nSheldon-bot : I must speak to him.\nLeonard: Of course you must.\nPenny: You know, there\xe2\x80\x99s an Olive Garden down the street. You guys should try it sometime.\nSheldon-bot : Excuse me, Mr. Wozniak?\nSteve Wozniak: Oh, hey. Nice virtual presence device.\nSheldon-bot : Thank you. I just want to say I\xe2\x80\x99m a big fan. You\xe2\x80\x99re my fifteenth favourite technological visionary.\nSteve Wozniak: Only fifteenth?\nSheldon-bot : It\xe2\x80\x99s still six spots above Steve Jobs. I care neither for turtlenecks nor showmanship.\nSteve Wozniak: Yeah, I never got that turtleneck thing.\nSheldon-bot : One of my proudest possessions is a vintage 1977 Apple Two. Despite the file system limitations of Apple DOS 3.3, it was a pretty nifty little achievement.\nSteve Wozniak: Thanks, we were shooting for nifty. You know, if you had it here, I\xe2\x80\x99d autograph it for you.\nSheldon-bot: Don\xe2\x80\x99t move for 15 to 30 minutes, depending on how the buses are running.\nSteve Wozniak: Nerds.\nScene: The hallway. Sheldon exits carrying the Apple 2.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m coming, Woz, I\xe2\x80\x99m coming. (Trips on stairs.) Ow! Aw.\nScene: The hallway. Sheldon-bot approaches Penny\xe2\x80\x99s door and starts bashing into it.\nSheldon-bot : (Bash) Penny. (Bash) Penny. (Bash) Penny.\nPenny: What up, Shel-Bot?\nSheldon-bot: I can\xe2\x80\x99t get out of bed. I hurt my ankle.\nPenny: What do you want me to do?\nSheldon-bot: Sing me Soft Kitty.\nPenny: Really, you want me to sing Soft Kitty to a computer monitor?\nSheldon-bot: Would you rather come over and sing it to me in person?\nPenny: Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur.\nSheldon-bot: Closer to the microphone.\nPenny: Happy kitty, sleepy\xe2\x80\xa6\nSheldon-bot: No. You have to start over.\nPenny: Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur. Happy kitty, sleepy kitty, purr, purr, purr.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
