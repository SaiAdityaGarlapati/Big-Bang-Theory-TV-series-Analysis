b'Scene: The stairwell.\nLeonard: So you see, what you\xe2\x80\x99re eating is not technically yoghurt, because it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have enough live acidophilus cultures. It\xe2\x80\x99s really just iced milk with carragenin added for thickness.\nPenny: Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s very interesting.\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s also not pink and has no berries.\nPenny: Yeah, but it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t really answer my question.\nLeonard: What was your question again?\nPenny: Do you want some.\nLeonard: Oh, right, no, I\xe2\x80\x99m lactose intolerant.\nPenny: Right.\nLeonard: So, gas.\nPenny: Got it.\nLeonard: Well, good night. (They kiss. Camera cuts away to a wall mounted security cam above the lift. Leonard spots its movement and shuffles Penny away.)\nPenny: What are you doing?\nLeonard: There was a draft.\nPenny: I didn\xe2\x80\x99t feel a draft.\nLeonard: Why don\xe2\x80\x99t we just go into your\xe2\x80\xa6.\nPenny: Oh, yeah, you know what, maybe we should just slow things down a little.\nLeonard: No, no, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to go into your apartment to\xe2\x80\xa6 go fast.\nPenny: No, I know, I\xe2\x80\xa6 I know what you meant, it\xe2\x80\x99s just\xe2\x80\xa6 it\xe2\x80\x99s only our first date.\nLeonard: Yeah, okay, sure, no problem, why don\xe2\x80\x99t we just figure out where we\xe2\x80\x99re going, and when we want to get there, and then rate of speed equals distance over time. Solve for R.\nPenny: Or we could just wing it.\nLeonard: That might work too.\nPenny: Goodnight Leonard.\nLeonard: Goodnight. (He throws the camera a dirty look.)\nCut to inside the apartment.\nRaj: He\xe2\x80\x99s coming. Screen saver.\nHoward: Oh, hey, Leonard, how was your date?\nLeonard: Bite me. Sheldon, how could you just sit there and let them spy on me?\nSheldon: They were clever, Leonard. They exploited my complete lack of interest in what you were doing.\nHoward: You should thank us. When future generations try to determine why your relationship with Penny crashed and burned, this right here is the black box.\nLeonard: What are you talking about, the date went fine.\nRaj: Dude, she said she wants to slow things down.\nLeonard: Okay, so, she said she wants to slow things down. It\xe2\x80\x99s like saying \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m really enjoying this meal, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to slow down and savour it.\xe2\x80\x9d\nHoward: No, it\xe2\x80\x99s like \xe2\x80\x9cthis fish tastes bad, so I\xe2\x80\x99m going to slow down and spit it out.\xe2\x80\x9d\nRaj: You being the fish.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m not the fish.\nHoward: Oh really, did you make a second date.\nLeonard: Well, we sort of decided to wing it.\nSheldon: Oh, even I know that\xe2\x80\x99s lame.\nLeonard: Okay, alright, let\xe2\x80\x99s assume your hypothesis. We went to dinner, we talked, we laughed, we kissed, where could I have possibly gone wrong.\n Howard: Think back, Leonard, the littlest things can set women off. Like, hey, the waitress is hot, I bet we could get her to come home with us. Or, how much does your mom weigh, I want to know what I\xe2\x80\x99m getting into.\nLeonard: I didn\xe2\x80\x99t say anything like that.\nHoward: Good, \xe2\x80\x98cos they don\xe2\x80\x99t work.\nRaj: They also don\xe2\x80\x99t care for it if you stare at them and hyperventilate. Sadly, that\xe2\x80\x99s my home run swing.\nLeonard: Look, everything went fine. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t even have to refer to my impromptu conversation starters. The woman across the hall is into me.\nHoward: Let\xe2\x80\x99s go to the tape. Look at her reaction to the goodnight kiss, no change in respiration, pupils un-dilated, no flushing of the chest.\nRaj: Nice close up, by the way.\nSheldon: Interesting, her jaws are clenched, no tongue access, clearly a bad sign amongst mating humans.\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99s not a bad sign.\nSheldon: Please, you might as well have been two iguana with no dewlap enlargement.\nRaj: And the worst sign of all is, you\xe2\x80\x99re here and not there.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m not there because I\xe2\x80\x99m taking things slow. Which, by the way, compared to you guys approaches warp speed. And take down that camera.\nRaj: He was a lot more fun when he had no hope.\nHoward: Give him time.\nCredits sequence\nScene: The laundry room. Sheldon is folding shirts.\nPenny (entering): Hi.\nSheldon: Oh, hi Penny. FYI, the hot water is inadequate on machine 2 so colours only, and 4 is still releasing the fabric softener too early in the cycle so I\xe2\x80\x99d avoid using that for your delicates.\nPenny (tipping all her laundry into one machine at once): Thanks.\nSheldon: Oh, good Lord. Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you just take your clothes down to the river and beat them with a rock?\nPenny: Sheldon, may I ask you a question?\nSheldon: I would prefer that you not, but I won\xe2\x80\x99t go so far as to forbid it.\nPenny: Alright, I heard yes, so\xe2\x80\xa6 okay, here\xe2\x80\x99s my question, has Leonard ever dated, you know, a regular girl.\nSheldon: Well I assume you\xe2\x80\x99re not referring to digestive regularity? Because I\xe2\x80\x99ve come to learn that such inquiries are inappropriate.\nPenny: No, I meant has he ever been involved with someone who wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a braniac?\nSheldon: Oh. Well, a few years ago he did go out with a woman who had a PhD in French Literature.\nPenny: How is that not a braniac?\nSheldon: Well, for one thing, she was French. For another, it was literature.\nPenny: So, do you think that if Leonard and I keep dating he\xe2\x80\x99ll eventually get bored with me.\nSheldon: That depends.\nPenny: On what?\nSheldon: Do you have a working knowledge of quantum physics?\nPenny: No.\nSheldon: Do you speak Klingon?\nPenny: No.\nSheldon: Do you know any card tricks?\nPenny: Okay, okay, you know, I get it, Leonard has no business being involved with a waitress slash actress who felt so insecure that she lied to him about finishing community college.\nSheldon: Why would you lie about that?\nPenny: Well, he was going on and on about this college and that grad school and I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want him to think I was some stupid loser.\nSheldon: You thought the opposite of stupid loser was community college graduate?\nPenny: You know, there are a lot of successful people in this country who are community college graduates.\nSheldon: Yeah, but you were neither.\nPenny: Right, okay look, this is between you and me, you cannot tell Leonard any of this.\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re asking me to keep a secret?\nPenny: Yeah.\nSheldon: Well I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, but you would have had to express that desire before revealing the secret, so that I could choose whether or not I wanted to accept the covenant of secret keeping. You can\xe2\x80\x99t impose a secret on an ex post facto basis.\nPenny: What?\nSheldon: Secret keeping is a complicated endeavour. One has to be concerned not only about what one says, but about facial expression, autonomic reflexes, when I try to deceive, I myself have more nervous tics than a lyme disease research facility. (Long pause.) It\xe2\x80\x99s a joke. It relies on the hominymic relationship between tick the blood-sucking arachnid, and tic the involuntary muscular contraction. I made it up myself.\nPenny: Okay, look, if Leonard finds out that I lied, I will absolutely die of embarrassment.\nSheldon: Physiologically impossible.\nPenny: Oh Sheldon, please, look, I\xe2\x80\x99m asking you as a friend.\nSheldon: So you\xe2\x80\x99re saying that friendship contains within it an inherent obligation to maintain confidences?\nPenny: Well, yeah.\nSheldon: Interesting. See, one more question, and perhaps I should have led with this, when did we become friends?\nScene: The stairwell.\nSheldon: I.e, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t become Green Lantern unless I was chosen by the guardians of Oa, but given enough start-up capital and an adequate research facility, I could be Batman.\nLeonard: You could be Batman?\nSheldon: Sure. (In a gravelly voice) I\xe2\x80\x99m Batman. See.\nPenny (arriving): Hi guys.\nLeonard: Hey.\nSheldon (looking the other way uncomfortably): Hi Penny.\nLeonard: Hey, Penny, if you\xe2\x80\x99re not doing anything Friday night I thought maybe we could go and see a movie.\nPenny: Oh, um, you know, I think I have the dinner shift on Friday.\nLeonard: What about Saturday?\nPenny: You know, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure, the manager hasn\xe2\x80\x99t posted the schedule yet, how about I let you know.\nLeonard: Great. So you just let me know when you know. So\xe2\x80\xa6 (she leaves) Oh God, I am the bad fish! What did I do wrong?\nSheldon: Why are you asking me, I have no information about your interactions with Penny other than what you provided me, nor do I have any method of learning such things. (Runs away.)\nLeonard (chasing him): What does that mean?\nSheldon: Nothing. You seem to be implying an informational back channel between me and Penny where obviously none exists.\nLeonard: No I didn\xe2\x80\x99t.\nSheldon: I just think you need to be careful how you phrase things, sir.\nLeonard: What\xe2\x80\x99s going on with you?\nSheldon: Well I might ask you the same question. Why do you insist on attempting to drag me into matters which have nothing to do with me? But exist between you and Penny. A person to whom I barely speak. (His eye begins to twitch.)\nLeonard: What\xe2\x80\x99s wrong with your face?\nSheldon: There\xe2\x80\x99s no reason to bring my looks into this. Good day, Leonard.\nLeonard: What?\nSheldon: I said Good Day! (He leaves)\nLeonard: Good day?\nScene: The Cheesecake Factory\nPenny: Also today we have a fresh caught Alaska salmon, and that\xe2\x80\x99s served with a teriyaki glaze and sticky rice. Our soup of the day\xe2\x80\xa6\nSheldon (appearing behind her): You must release me from my oath.\nPenny: Sheldon, I\xe2\x80\x99m working.\nSheldon: Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you take a minute to decide (leads her away) I can\xe2\x80\x99t keep your secret Penny. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to fold like an energy based anobo protein in conformational space. Like a renaissance triptych. Like a cheap suit.\nPenny: Oh, look, why is it so hard for you to keep one little secret?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m constitutionally incapable. That\xe2\x80\x99s why I was refused clearance for a very prestigious government research fellowship at a secret military supercollider, located beneath a fake agricultural station 12.5 miles south east of Travers City, Michigan. Which you did not hear about from me.\nPenny: Look, just forget I told you about me not graduating from community college. Okay?\nSheldon: Forget! You want me to forget? This mind does not forget. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t forgotten a single thing since the day my mother stopped breast feeding me. It was a drizzly Tuesday.\nPenny: Okay, look, you promised me you would keep my secret so you\xe2\x80\x99re just going to have to figure out a way to do it.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon (entering): Leonard, I\xe2\x80\x99m moving out.\nLeonard: What do you mean, you\xe2\x80\x99re moving out? Why?\nSheldon: There doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have to be a reason.\nLeonard: Yeah, there kind of does.\nSheldon: Not necessarily. This is a classic example of munchausen\xe2\x80\x99s trilemma. Either the reason is predicated on a series of sub-reasons leading to an infinite regression, or it tracks back to arbitrary axiomatic statements, or it\xe2\x80\x99s ultimately circular, i.e., I\xe2\x80\x99m moving out because I\xe2\x80\x99m moving out.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m still confused.\nSheldon: Leonard, I don\xe2\x80\x99t see how I could have made it any simpler.\nHoward (entering): Hey, qu\xe2\x80\x99est q\xe2\x80\x99wass up?\nRaj: We just got back from that exhibit of those plasticised human cadavers.\nHoward: And some of those skinless chicks were hot.\nSheldon: If you\xe2\x80\x99ll excuse me, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to pack.\nHoward: That\xe2\x80\x99s kind of an overreaction to a little harmless necrophilia.\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s not you, Howard, he says he\xe2\x80\x99s moving out.\nRaj: What did you do? Did you change the contrast or brightness settings on the television?\nLeonard: No.\nRaj: Did you take a band aid off in front of him?\nLeonard: No.\nHoward: Did you buy generic ketchup, forget to rinse the sink, talk to him through the bathroom door?\nRaj: Adjust the thermostat, cook with cilantro, pronounce the T in often?\nLeonard: No.\nHoward: Did you make fun of trains?\nLeonard: I didn\xe2\x80\x99t do anything, he\xe2\x80\x99s just gone insane.\nRaj: Well, we all knew this day was coming.\nLeonard: That was fast.\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s my pre-packed disaster evacuation bag. Recommended by the department of homeland security. And Sarah Connor.\nLeonard: Where are you gonna live?\nSheldon: Until I find a permanent place I will stay with friends.\nHoward: Bye (runs out.)\nRaj: Well you can\xe2\x80\x99t stay with me, I have a teeny tiny apartment.\nSheldon: Excuse me, but isn\xe2\x80\x99t hosting guests an aspect of Menushya Yajna, one of the five central religious duties or sacrifices of the Hindu householder?\nRaj: I hate trains.\nSheldon: Don\xe2\x80\x99t be ridiculous, you love trains.\nRaj: Yes I do, come on. See you later Leonard. (Sheldon drops keys in bowl and leaves without a word.)\nLeonard: This could work.\nScene: Raj\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nSheldon: This is a very old building.\nRaj: Sixty years. Used to be a watch factory.\nSheldon: Uh-oh.\nRaj: What?\nSheldon: Don\xe2\x80\x99t you worry about the residual radium from the luminous dials?\nRaj: Not until now.\nSheldon: I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe I didn\xe2\x80\x99t bring my gieger counter. You know, I had it on my bed and I didn\xe2\x80\x99t pack it.\nRaj: Well, if you\xe2\x80\x99re not comfortable staying here, Sheldon\xe2\x80\xa6\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m kidding, I packed it. It was a joke, I was subverting the conversational expectations. I believe they call that the, um, old switcheroo.\nRaj: Terrific.\nSheldon (referring to Bollywood singing on television): Is that woman Aishwarya Rai?\nRaj: Yes, isn\xe2\x80\x99t she an amazing actress.\nSheldon: Actually, I\xe2\x80\x99d say she\xe2\x80\x99s a poor man\xe2\x80\x99s Madhuri Dixit.\nRaj: How dare you. Aishwarya Rai is a Goddess. By comparison Madhuri Dixit is a leprous prostitute.\nSheldon: Sorry, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to offend you. Obviously you\xe2\x80\x99re not that familiar with Indian cinema.\nScene: Howard\xe2\x80\x99s house. The door rings.\nHoward: Who is it?\nVoice: Strippergram. (Howard opens door. Outside are Raj and Sheldon.)\nRaj: Tag. You\xe2\x80\x99re it. (Runs away.)\nHoward: Shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you have put him in a brown paper bag and set him on fire?\nScene: Howard\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom. Howard is in bed, Sheldon is on a blow up mattress on the floor.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99ve never slept on an air mattress before. No lumbar support whatsoever.\nHoward: Maybe you\xe2\x80\x99d be happier on a park bench?\nSheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t see any way to get a park bench in here.\nHoward: Do you want to switch?\nSheldon: No, that\xe2\x80\x99s fine. I\xe2\x80\x99m perfectly comfortable sleeping on a bouncy castle.\nHoward: Get out of bed, we\xe2\x80\x99re switching.\nSheldon: Now, only if you want to.\nHoward: Just get in the bed!\nHoward\xe2\x80\x99s mother (off): What\xe2\x80\x99s going on? Are you boys roughhousing?\nHoward: We\xe2\x80\x99re just talking ma.\nHoward\xe2\x80\x99s mother: If you don\xe2\x80\x99t settle down right now, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to let you have any more sleepovers.\nHoward: For God\xe2\x80\x99s sake, ma, I\xe2\x80\x99m 27 years old. It\xe2\x80\x99s not even a school night! (To Sheldon) Comfy now?\nSheldon: Meh. That poster of Halle Berry\xe2\x80\x99s a little unnerving.\nHoward: So don\xe2\x80\x99t look at it.\nSheldon: She\xe2\x80\x99s like my fourth favourite catwoman.\nHoward: No kidding?\nSheldon: Yeah, Julie Newmar, Michelle Pfieffer, Eartha Kitt and then her.\nHoward: What about Lee Meriwether?\nSheldon: Oh, I forgot about Lee Meriwether.\nHoward: Well I\xe2\x80\x99m glad that\xe2\x80\x99s settled.\nSheldon: That makes Halle Berry my fifth favourite catwoman. There\xe2\x80\x99s Julie Newmar, Michelle Pfieffer, Eartha Kitt, Lee Meriwether\xe2\x80\xa6\nHoward: Please, I\xe2\x80\x99m begging you, go to sleep.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m trying, I\xe2\x80\x99m counting catwomen. She did make a fine mutant in the X-Men movies though.\nHoward: Oh for God\xe2\x80\x99s sake.\nSheldon: But she\xe2\x80\x99s not my favourite of the X-Men, in order that would be Wolverine, Cyclops, oh wait, I forgot Professor X. Professor X, Wolverine, Cyclops, Iceman, then Storm, Angel, the Beast, oh wait, Nightcrawler. Professor X, Nightcrawler, Wolverine, Cyclops, Iceman, then Storm, Angel\xe2\x80\xa6.\nScene: Sheldon and Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s apartment. There is an urgent rapping at the door.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m coming! (Opens the door. Sheldon falls inside, wearing his pyjamas. Howard is outside.)\nSheldon: Hey, there he is, there\xe2\x80\x99s my old buddy-bud-bud.\nLeonard: What\xe2\x80\x99s with him?\nHoward: Koothrappali dumped him on me, and he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get to sleep, so I gave him a glass of warm milk with a handful of my mom\xe2\x80\x99s valium in it. But he still wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t shut up, so, tag, you\xe2\x80\x99re it.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m ba-ack!\nLeonard: I still don\xe2\x80\x99t know why you left.\nSheldon: I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell you.\nLeonard: Why not.\nSheldon: I promised Penny.\nLeonard: You promised Penny what?\nSheldon: That I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t tell you the secret. Shhhhh!\nLeonard: What secret. Tell me the secret.\nSheldon: Mom smokes in the car. Jesus is okay with it, but we can\xe2\x80\x99t tell Dad.\nLeonard: Not that secret, the other secret.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m Batman. Shhhhh!\nLeonard: Dammit, Sheldon! You said Penny told you a secret, what was the secret.\nSheldon: Okay, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you, but you can\xe2\x80\x99t tell Leonard.\nLeonard: I promise.\nSheldon: Penny lied about graduating from community college because she is afraid she\xe2\x80\x99s not smart enough for Leonard.\nLeonard: So it\xe2\x80\x99s nothing I did? It\xe2\x80\x99s her problem?\nSheldon: I drank milk that tasted funny.\nLeonard: Penny thinks I\xe2\x80\x99m too smart for her, that\xe2\x80\x99s ridiculous.\nSheldon: I know, most of your work is extremely derivative. Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry, that\xe2\x80\x99s not a secret. Everybody knows.\nScene: The hallway. Leonard is outside Penny\xe2\x80\x99s door.\nPenny (opening door): Hi.\nLeonard: Yeah, hi, listen, I know what\xe2\x80\x99s been bothering you about us, and I have the answer.\nPenny: What are you talking about.\nLeonard: First I want to say that it\xe2\x80\x99s not Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s fault, he tried very hard to keep your secret, if Howard hadn\xe2\x80\x99t drugged him he would have taken it to his grave.\nPenny: He told you?\nLeonard: Yes, but it\xe2\x80\x99s okay. Now that we know what the problem is, there\xe2\x80\x99s a simple solution. (Hands her a brochure.)\nPenny: Pasadena city college?\nLeonard: A place for fun, a place for knowledge. See, this man here\xe2\x80\x99s playing hacky sack, and this girl\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a paralegal.\nPenny: Wow, I get it, because Dr Leonard Hofstadter can\xe2\x80\x99t date a girl without a fancy college degree.\nLeonard: Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s really not that fancy, it\xe2\x80\x99s just a city college.\nPenny: Right, but I have to have some sort of degree to date you?\nLeonard: That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter to me at all.\nPenny: So, it\xe2\x80\x99s fine with you if I\xe2\x80\x99m not smart.\nLeonard: Absolutely. (She slams the door in his face.) Okay, this time I know where I went wrong. (Looking up and seeing the camera) Oh bite me!\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
