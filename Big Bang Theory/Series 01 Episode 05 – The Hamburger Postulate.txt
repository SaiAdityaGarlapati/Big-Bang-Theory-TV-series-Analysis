b'Scene: The Cheesecake Factory\nSheldon: Alright, I\xe2\x80\x99m moving my infantry division, augmented by a battalion of Orcs from Lord of the Rings, we flank the Tennessee Volunteers, and the North once again wins the Battle of Gettysburg.\nHoward: Not so fast, remember the South still has two infantry divisions, plus Superman and Godzilla.\nLeonard: No, no, no, no, Orcs are magic, Superman is vulnerable to magic, not to mention, you already lost Godzilla to the Illinois Cavalry and Hulk.\nRaj: Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you just have Robert E. Lee charge the line with Shiva and Ganesh.\nPenny: Hi, you guys ready to order?\nHoward: Hang on, honey. Shiva and Ganesh? The Hindu Gods against the entire Union army?\nLeonard: And Orcs!\nPenny: I\xe2\x80\x99ll be back.\nRaj: Excuse me, Ganesh is the remover of obstacles, and Shiva is the destroyer. When the smoke clears, Abraham Lincoln will be speaking Hindi and drinking mint juleps.\nPenny: Alright, my boss says you either have to order, or leave and never come back.\nHoward: What do you recommend for someone who worked up a man-sized appetite from a morning of weight training and cardio-funk?\nPenny: A shower.\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99ll take the heart smart platter.\nPenny: Alright, thank you, and Sheldon.\nSheldon: We don\xe2\x80\x99t eat here, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what\xe2\x80\x99s good.\nPenny: Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s all good.\nSheldon: Statistically unlikely.\nLeonard: Just get a hamburger, you like hamburgers.\nSheldon: I like the hamburgers where we usually have hamburgers, you can\xe2\x80\x99t make the assumption that I\xe2\x80\x99ll like the hamburgers here.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. Give him a hamburger.\nPenny: Uh, which one, the Classic Burger, the Ranch House Burger, the Barbecue Burger or the Kobe burger?\nSheldon: Can\xe2\x80\x99t we just go to Big Boy? They only have one burger. The Big Boy.\nPenny: The Barbecue Burger is like the Big Boy.\nSheldon: Excuse me, in a world that already includes the Big Boy, why would I settle for something like a Big Boy?\nPenny: Because you are not at Big Boy!\nSheldon: Fine, I\xe2\x80\x99ll have the Barbecue Burger.\nLeonard: Make it two.\nSheldon: Waitresses don\xe2\x80\x99t yell at you at Big Boy.\nLesley (entering): Hey Leonard, hi guys.\nLeonard: Hey Lesley.\nLesley: I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know you ate here.\nSheldon: We don\xe2\x80\x99t. This is a disturbing aberration.\nLeonard: Lesley, this is Penny, she lives across the hall from Sheldon and me.\nHoward: And walks in quiet beauty like the night.\nPenny: Howard, I\xe2\x80\x99ve asked you not to do that.\nLeonard: Lesley and I do research together at the University.\nPenny: Oh, wow, a girl scientist.\nLesley: Yep, come for the breasts, stay for the brains. So, I\xe2\x80\x99m glad I ran into you, the physics department string quartet needs a new cellist.\nLeonard: What happened to Elliot Wong?\nLesley: He switched over to high energy radiation research, had a little mishap, and now the other guys are uncomfortable sitting next to him. So, are you in?\nLeonard: Yeah, sure, why not.\nLesley: Great, we rehearse on Tuesdays at your place.\nLeonard: Why at my place?\nLesley: Yeah, the department of energy said our regular space is kind of a hot zone. Nice meeting you.\nPenny: Yeah, you too. Leonard, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know you played the cello?\nLeonard: Yeah, my parents felt that naming me Leonard and putting me in advanced placement classes wasn\xe2\x80\x99t getting me beaten up enough.\nHoward: If you\xe2\x80\x99re into music, I happen to be a human beatbox.\nPenny: Really? (Howard performs some of the worst beatboxing imaginable.) I\xe2\x80\x99m actually not that into music. So hey, your friend\xe2\x80\x99s really cute, anything going on with you two.\nLeonard: Lesley? No, no-oh, what are you kidding?\nSheldon: He asked her out once, it was an embarrassing failure.\nLeonard: Thank you Sheldon.\nSheldon: Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, was that supposed to be a secret?\nPenny: Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s too bad, you guys would make a cute couple.\nRaj: Oh dear.\nHoward: What\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\nRaj: She didn\xe2\x80\x99t take my order.\nHoward: How can she take your order when you\xe2\x80\x99re too neurotic to talk to her.\nRaj: Nevertheless, this will be reflected in her tip.\nScene: The stairwell of the apartment building.\nLeonard: What did Penny mean, you\xe2\x80\x99d make a cute couple?\nSheldon: Well I assume she meant that the two of you together would constitute a couple that others might consider cute. An alternate, and somewhat less likely interpretation, is that you could manufacture one. As in, oh look, Leonard and Lesley made Mr and Mrs Goldfarb, aren\xe2\x80\x99t they adorable.\nLeonard: If Penny didn\xe2\x80\x99t know that Lesley had already turned me down then that would unambiguously mean that she, Penny, thought that I should her, Lesley, out, indicating that she, Penny, had no interest in me asking her, Penny, out. But because she did know that I had asked Lesley out and that she, Lesley, had turned me down then she, Penny, could be offering consolation. That\xe2\x80\x99s too bad, you would have made a cute couple. But while thinking, good, Leonard remains available.\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re a lucky man, Leonard.\nLeonard: How so?\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re talking to one of the three men in the Western hemisphere capable of following that train of thought.\nLeonard: Well, what do you think.\nSheldon: I said I could follow it, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t say I cared.\nCredit sequence.\nScene: The apartment living room. The string quartet are practising.\nLesley: I admire your fingering.\nLeonard: Thank you.\nLesley: Maybe some time you can try that on my instrument.\nTime jump\nLesley: Goodnight guys, good job.\nMale string quartettist: Thanks.\nFemale string quartettist: See you next week.\nLeonard: That was fun, Lesley, thanks for including me.\nLesley: You\xe2\x80\x99re welcome. If you\xe2\x80\x99re up for it we could practise that middle section again.\nLeonard: Uh, sure, why not.\nLesley: Just so we\xe2\x80\x99re clear, you understand that me hanging back to practise with you is a pretext for letting you know that I\xe2\x80\x99m sexually available.\nLeonard: Really?\nLesley: Yeah, I\xe2\x80\x99m good to go.\nLeonard: I thought you weren\xe2\x80\x99t interested in me.\nLesley: That was before I saw you handling that beautiful piece of wood between your legs.\nLeonard: You mean my cello?\nLesley: No, I mean the obvious crude double entendre. I\xe2\x80\x99m seducing you.\nLeonard: No kidding?\nLesley: What can I say, I\xe2\x80\x99m a passionate and impulsive woman. So how about it?\nLeonard: Gee, uh\xe2\x80\xa6\nLesley: Is it the waitress?\nLeonard: Penny? What about her?\nLesley: Well, I thought I saw your pupils dilate when you looked at her, which, unless you\xe2\x80\x99re a heroin addict, points to sexual attraction.\nLeonard: Well, I did have a poppy seed bagel for breakfast, which could give a positive urine test for opiates but certainly not dilate my pupils, so I guess there\xe2\x80\x99s no point in bringing it up.\nLesley: You and the waitress then?\nLeonard: No. No, there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing going on between Penny and me.\nLesley: So, you\xe2\x80\x99re open to a sexual relationship?\nLeonard: Yeah. Yeah, I guess I am.\nLesley: Good.\nLeonard: Yeah, yeah it is good. Did you want to start now?\nLesley: Why don\xe2\x80\x99t we finish the section first.\nLeonard: Oh. Okay. A little musical foreplay. Terrific.\n(They play, gradually going faster and faster.)\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m good, I\xe2\x80\x99m good to go.\nLesley: Me too. (Exit in direction of bedrooms.)\nScene: The hallway, Sheldon scuttles out of apartment door and crosses to Penny\xe2\x80\x99s. Knocks on it urgently.\nPenny (opening door): Oh, hey Sheldon, what\xe2\x80\x99s going on?\nSheldon: I need your opinion on a matter of semiotics.\nPenny: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry?\nSheldon: Semiotics. The study of signs and symbols, it\xe2\x80\x99s a branch of philosophy related to linguistics.\nPenny: Okay, sweetie, I know you think you\xe2\x80\x99re explaining yourself, but you\xe2\x80\x99re really not.\nSheldon: Just come with me.\nJump to the pair of them standing outside Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom door. Bryan Adams \xe2\x80\x9cHave You Ever Loved A Woman\xe2\x80\x9d is emerging. There is a tie on the bedroom door.\nSheldon: Well?\nPenny: Well what?\nSheldon: What does it mean?\nPenny: Oh, come on, you went to college.\nSheldon: Yes, but I was eleven.\nPenny: Alright, look, a tie on the doorknob usually means someone doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to be disturbed because they\xe2\x80\x99re, you know, getting busy.\nSheldon: So you\xe2\x80\x99re saying Leonard has a girl in there.\nPenny: Well, either that or he\xe2\x80\x99s lost his tie rack and gotten really into Bryan Adams.\nLesley (voice off): Oh Leonard, you magnificent beast.\nPenny: We really shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be standing here.\nSheldon (entering living room): This is very awkward.\nPenny: Oh, come on, you know, Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s had girls over before, right?\nSheldon: Oh, yes, but there\xe2\x80\x99s usually planning, courtship and advance notice. Last time I was able to book a cruise to the Arctic to see a solar eclipse.\nPenny: Wait, you had to leave the state because your roommate was having sex?\nSheldon: I didn\xe2\x80\x99t have to, the dates just happened to coincide.\nPenny: So, do you know who\xe2\x80\x99s in there?\nSheldon: Well, there\xe2\x80\x99s Leonard. (Picking up violin case) And he\xe2\x80\x99s either with Lesley Winkle or a 1930\xe2\x80\x99s gangster.\nPenny: Hmmm. Good for him. Good for Leonard. Okay, night.\nSheldon: No, no, wait, hold on.\nPenny: What\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\nSheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what the protocol is here. Do I stay, do I leave? Do I wait to greet them with a refreshing beverage?\nPenny: Gee, Sheldon, you\xe2\x80\x99re asking the wrong girl. I\xe2\x80\x99m usually on the other side of the tie.\n(Sheldon looks lost for a moment. The pulls out his mobile phone and dials.)\nSheldon: Hi, Leonard. It\xe2\x80\x99s me, Sheldon. In the living room. I just, I wanted you to know I saw the tie. Message received. You\xe2\x80\x99re welcome. You carry on. Give my best to Lesley.\nScene: In Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s Bedroom. Leonard wakes up next to Lesley, puts on glasses and grins.\nScene: Living room, Sheldon is sleeping on the sofa, with his head on Lesley\xe2\x80\x99s Violin case.\nSheldon: Big boy! (Wakes up, looks at watch, wraps self in blanket, walks towards kitchen) Someone touched my board. Oh God, my board. Leonard! Leonard!\nLeonard (entering): Hey, what\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\nSheldon: My equations, someone\xe2\x80\x99s tampered with my equations.\nLeonard: Are you sure?\nSheldon: Of course I\xe2\x80\x99m sure. Look at the beta-function of quantum chrono-dynamics, the sign\xe2\x80\x99s been changed.\nLeonard: Oh yeah. But doesn\xe2\x80\x99t that fix the problem you\xe2\x80\x99ve been having?\nSheldon: Are you insane? Are you out of your mind? Are you\xe2\x80\xa6. hey look, that fixes the problem I\xe2\x80\x99ve been having.\nLesley (entering): You\xe2\x80\x99re welcome.\nSheldon: You did this?\nLesley: Yeah, I noticed it when I got up to get a glass of water, so I fixed it, now you can show that quarks are asymptotically free at high energies. Pretty cool, huh?\nSheldon: Cool?\nLesley: Listen, I got to hit the lab. Thanks for a great night.\nLeonard: Thank you, I\xe2\x80\x99ll see you at work.\nSheldon: Uh-duh, hold on, hold on!\nLesley: What?\nSheldon: Who told you you could touch my board?\nLesley: No-one.\nSheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t come into your house and touch your board.\nLesley: There are no incorrect equations on my board.\nSheldon: Oh, that is so\xe2\x80\xa6 so\xe2\x80\xa6\nLesley: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to run, if you come up with an adjective, text me. (Leaves).\nSheldon: Inconsiderate, that is the adjective, inconsiderate.\nScene: The hallway.\nLeonard (exiting the apartment): You can stare at your board all day Sheldon, she\xe2\x80\x99s still going to be right.\nSheldon (inside): I\xe2\x80\x99m not staring, I\xe2\x80\x99m mulling.\nPenny: Oh, hey Leonard.\nLeonard: Oh, hi.\nPenny: So, how\xe2\x80\x99s it going?\nLeonard: Pretty good.\nPenny: Just pretty good, I\xe2\x80\x99d think you were doing very good.\nLeonard: Pretty, very, there\xe2\x80\x99s really no objective scale for delineating variations of good, why do you ask?\nPenny: Well, a little bird told me that you and Lesley hooked up last night.\nLeonard: Sheldon!\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m coming.\nPenny: So, is it serious, do you like her?\nLeonard: Wuh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\xa6. th-th-th-that\xe2\x80\x99s really two different questions, uh, I\xe2\x80\x99m not\xe2\x80\xa6. Sheldon, we have to go!\nSheldon: Boy, you\xe2\x80\x99re wound awfully tight for a man who just had sexual intercourse.\nPenny: Alright, well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll talk to you later, but, I am so happy for you Leonard.\nLeonard: Thank you. What did she mean, she\xe2\x80\x99s happy for me? Is she happy because I\xe2\x80\x99m seeing someone, or is she happy because she thinks that I\xe2\x80\x99m happy, because anyone who cared for someone would want them to be happy, even if the reason for their happiness made the first person unhappy. You know, because the second person, though happy, is now romantically unavailable to the first person.\nSheldon: Do you realise I may have to share a Nobel Prize with your booty call?\nLeonard: You know what, I\xe2\x80\x99m being ridiculous. But who cares what Penny thinks, Lesley is a terrific girl, she\xe2\x80\x99s attractive, we like each other, she\xe2\x80\x99s extremely intelligent.\nSheldon: She\xe2\x80\x99s not that intelligent.\nLeonard: She fixed your equation.\nSheldon: She got lucky.\nLeonard: You don\xe2\x80\x99t believe in luck.\nSheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t have to believe in it for her to be lucky.\nLeonard: Regardless, I have a chance at a real relationship with Lesley, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to pass that up for some hypothetical future happiness with a woman who may or may not want me to be happy with a woman who is currently making me happy.\nSheldon: Leonard?\nLeonard: Yeah.\nSheldon: I still don\xe2\x80\x99t care.\nScene: Leonard and Lesley\xe2\x80\x99s lab.\nLeonard: Hey, Lesley.\nLesley: Careful  Leonard, liquid nitrogen, 320 degrees below zero.\nLeonard: Brrrr. Why are you smashing a flash frozen banana.\nLesley: Because I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a bowl of Cheerios and I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t find a knife.\nLeonard: So anyway (puts arms around her) Hello.\nLesley: Uh, what are you doing?\nLeonard: Just extending the intimacy. Do you want to slip over to the radiation lab and share a decontamination shower?\nLesley: Okay, uh, what exactly do you think\xe2\x80\x99s going on between us?\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure, but I think I\xe2\x80\x99m about to discover how the banana felt.\nLesley: Listen, Leonard, neither of us are neuroscientists but we both understand the biochemistry of sex, I mean, dopamine in our brains is released across synapses causing pleasure. You stick electrodes in a rat\xe2\x80\x99s brain, give him an orgasm button, he\xe2\x80\x99ll push that thing until he starves to death. \nLeonard: Who wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t?\nLesley: Well, the only difference between us and a rat is that you can\xe2\x80\x99t stick an electrode in our hypothalamus. That\xe2\x80\x99s where you come in.\nLeonard: Yeah, well, I\xe2\x80\x99m just glad to be a part of it. So what happens now?\nLesley: Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know about your sex drive, but I\xe2\x80\x99m probably good till New Years.\nLeonard: Oh. Okay. Thank you.\nLesley: Thank you!\nLeonard: You want to make plans for New Years.\nLesley: Woah, Leonard, please, you\xe2\x80\x99re smothering me.\nLeonard (leaving): Sorry.\nHoward: Hey, look, it\xe2\x80\x99s Doctor Stud!\nLeonard: Doctor what?\nHoward: The blogosphere is a-buzzing with news of you and Lesley Winkle making eine kleine bang-bang music.\nLeonard: Wha\xe2\x80\xa6 how did it get on the internet?\nHoward: I put it there.\nLeonard: Well, how did you know about it?\nRaj: A little bird told us. Apparently you are a magnificent beast.\nLeonard: Well, that part\xe2\x80\x99s true!\nScene: The Cheesecake Factory.\nSheldon: You know, I think I may have misjudged this restaurant.\nLeonard: No kidding.\nSheldon: I won\xe2\x80\x99t go out on a limb, but I think we may be looking at my new Tuesday hamburger.\nLeonard: Your old Tuesday hamburger will be so broken hearted.\nSheldon: Way ahead of you. I was thinking of moving Big Boy to Thursdays, and just dropping Soup Plantation.\nLeonard: Really?\nSheldon: Yeah, the name always confused me anyway, Soup Plantation. You can\xe2\x80\x99t grow soup.\nPenny: So, how\xe2\x80\x99s everything.\nSheldon: Terrific, you\xe2\x80\x99ll be happy to know that I plan to come here every Tuesday night for the foreseeable future.\nPenny: Really, oh yay!\nSheldon: Who do I speak to about permanently reserving this table?\nPenny: Um, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, a psychiatrist? So hey, how are things with you and Lesley?\nLeonard: Oh, to be honest, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s going to work out.\nPenny: Oh, oh that\xe2\x80\x99s too bad. Well hey, don\xe2\x80\x99t worry, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure there is someone out there who is just right for you. (Walks away smiling).\nLeonard: Well what did she mean by that? Was that just a generic platitude or was that a subtle bid for attention?\nSheldon: You know why this hamburger surpasses the Big Boy? This is a single decker hamburger whereas the Big Boy is a double decker. This has a much more satisfying meat to bun to condiment ratio.\nLeonard: Are you even listening to me?\nSheldon: Of course I\xe2\x80\x99m listening. Blah blah, hopeless Penny delusion, blah blah blah.\nLeonard: Okay then. You know, you can grow the ingredients for soup. (Sheldon nods).\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
