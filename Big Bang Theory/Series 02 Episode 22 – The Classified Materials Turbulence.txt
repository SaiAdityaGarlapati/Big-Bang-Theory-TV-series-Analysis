b'Scene: The comic book store.\n  Sheldon: Smell that? That\xe2\x80\x99s the smell of new comic books. Oh, yes!\nHoward: They\xe2\x80\x99re on me today, boys.\nRaj: You\xe2\x80\x99re paying? Have you been selling your sperm again?\nHoward: No, I\xe2\x80\x99m celebrating. As we speak, the space shuttle is docking at the International Space Station where it will deploy the Wolowitz Zero-Gravity Waste Disposal System.\nRaj: Oh, get over yourself, it\xe2\x80\x99s a high-tech toilet.\nLeonard: Just think. Thanks to your hard work, an international crew of astronauts will boldly go\nwhere no man has gone before.\nHoward: Is that supposed to be funny?\nSheldon: I believe it is. The combination of the Star Trek reference and the play on words involving the double-meaning of the verb to go suggests that Leonard is humorously mocking your efforts in space plumbing.\nHoward: Okay, make your little jokes, but of the four of us, I\xe2\x80\x99m the only one making any real-world contribution to science and technology.\nRaj: He\xe2\x80\x99s right. This is an important achievement, for two reasons. Number one, and, of course, number two.\nSheldon: Oh, clever! Playing on the use of cardinal numbers as euphemisms for bodily functions.\nStuart: Here, Sheldon, I pulled the new Hellboy for you. It\xe2\x80\x99s mind-blowing.\nSheldon: Excuse me, spoiler alert.\nStuart: I didn\xe2\x80\x99t spoil anything.\nSheldon: You told me it\xe2\x80\x99s mind-blowing, so, my mind is going into it pre-blown. And once a mind is pre-blown, it cannot be re-blown.\nStuart: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.\nSheldon: Said the Grinch to Christmas.\nStuart: Uh, hey, Leonard, can I talk to you about something?\nLeonard: Oh, sure, what\xe2\x80\x99s up?\nStuart: Remember I went out with your friend Penny a couple weeks ago?\nLeonard: Yeah, vaguely.\nRaj: Sure you remember. You went to the bar and made a fool of yourself trying to pick up strange women.\nLeonard: What about it?\nStuart: Well, uh, the thing is, the date didn\xe2\x80\x99t go that well.\nLeonard: Oh, too bad. I guess the thing to do now is just pick yourself up, dust yourself off, forget it and move on.\nStuart: I can\xe2\x80\x99t do that.\nLeonard: Why the hell not?\nStuart: \xe2\x80\x98Cause we\xe2\x80\x99re going out again tomorrow.\nSheldon: Excuse me, Stuart. Have you read the new Flash?\nStuart: No.\nSheldon: Well, I have and it will knock your socks off! Good luck getting them back on.\nStuart: Uh, anyway, I figured this is probably my last shot with Penny and I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to screw it up.\nLeonard: Nobody wants that.\nStuart: So, here\xe2\x80\x99s my question. It\xe2\x80\x99s the second date, you think she\xe2\x80\x99ll be expecting things to get physical?\nLeonard: Uh, oh, gee, my initial reaction is no. You know, let me think about it and get back to you, okay?\nStuart: Okay, so, you\xe2\x80\x99ll give me a call?\nLeonard: Yeah, or you call me.\nStuart: Great.\nLeonard: Or nobody calls anyone.\nRaj: Interesting. Penny\xe2\x80\x99s current suitor asking advice from her former suitor.\nLeonard: You know, thanks for closed-captioning my pain, Raj.\nHoward: Hey, wanna make sure he gets nowhere with Penny without jeopardizing your friendship with either of them?\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m listening.\nHoward: Just tell him to do everything you\xe2\x80\x99ve done with her for the last two years.\nCredits sequence.\n  Scene: The lobby.\nPenny: Hey, Leonard.\nLeonard: Oh, hi.\nPenny: How\xe2\x80\x99s it going?\nLeonard: Good, good. You?\nPenny: Fine. Oh, hey, can I ask you something?\nLeonard: Sure.\nPenny: You know your friend Stuart?\nLeonard: Yes.\nPenny: Well, he asked me out again and I said yes, and then I started thinking maybe I should talk to you first.\nLeonard: About what?\nPenny: Well, does it bother you, me going out with one of your friends? \xe2\x80\x98Cause you know, you and me\xe2\x80\xa6\nLeonard: No, no that\xe2\x80\x99s the past. I\xe2\x80\x99m really more of a right now kind of guy. You know, living in the moment. Although I do have to live a little in the future, \xe2\x80\x99cause, well, that\xe2\x80\x99s my job. Of course, my fondness for classic science fiction does draw my attention backwards, but those stories often take place in the future. In conclusion, no, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t bother me.\nPenny: Okay, well, that\xe2\x80\x99s really cool of you.\nLeonard: Yeah, well I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say cool, I\xe2\x80\x99d just say, that\xe2\x80\x99s Leonard!\nPenny: Well, In that case, do you mind giving me some advice?\nLeonard: About Stuart? Love to.\nPenny: He\xe2\x80\x99s very shy, how do I make him feel more comfortable around me?\nLeonard: Well, uh, first of all, don\xe2\x80\x99t underestimate the value of discomfort.\nPenny: Really?\nLeonard: Well, yeah, Stuart thrives under pressure, that\xe2\x80\x99s why he works in a comic book store.\nScene: The university cafeteria. Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s phone rings.\nLeonard: Oh. It\xe2\x80\x99s Stuart.\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re not going to answer it?\nLeonard: He wants to talk about Penny. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to talk about Penny.\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re making an assumption. Perhaps the comic book store is on fire, and he needs your assistance.\nLeonard: Why would he call me?\nSheldon: We don\xe2\x80\x99t know. And if you don\xe2\x80\x99t answer the phone, we can\xe2\x80\x99t know.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m not answering the phone, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Answer the phone, Leonard.\nLeonard: No! There, it went to voice mail.\nSheldon: Aren\xe2\x80\x99t you going to check your messages?\nLeonard: No.\nSheldon: You have to check your messages, the leaving of a message is one half of a social contract which is completed by the checking of the message. If that contract breaks down then all social contracts break down and we descend into anarchy.\nLeonard: It must be hell inside your head.\nSheldon: At times.\nHoward: Guys, we have a code red.\nSheldon: Do you mean code red the hospital emergency alert, code red the computer worm, or code red the cherry flavoured soft drink from the makers of Mountain Dew?\nHoward: Look, I was going over the schematics on my zero-G toilet, and I made a teeny tiny mistake on the specifications for the diverter valve.\nLeonard: How teeny tiny?\nHoward: It\xe2\x80\x99s gonna fail after about ten flushes.\nSheldon: But the mission is for six months.\nHoward: Yeah, see, that\xe2\x80\x99s the code red. It\xe2\x80\x99s kind of like a jack-in-the-box, no one knows exactly when, but at some point something way worse than a puppet is gonna pop out of that box.\nSheldon: Have you notified NASA?\nHoward: No. Are you crazy?What am I gonna say? I screwed up your toilet and pretty soon there\xe2\x80\x99s gonna be crap floating all over your nice shiny space station?\nLeonard: Well, what are you gonna do?\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna figure out how to fix it, then I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell them.\nLeonard: So, what do you need us for?\nRaj: He can\xe2\x80\x99t figure out how to fix it.\nHoward: Hey, you said you were gonna be supportive.\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99m trying, but you have to admit this is pretty damn funny.\nSheldon: I agree. It\xe2\x80\x99s the juxtaposition of the high-tech nature of space exploration against the banality of a malfunctioning toilet that provides the comic fodder here. Check your messages.\nScene: The apartment.\nHoward: All right, this is an exact duplicate of the Wolowitz Zero-Gravity Human Waste Disposal System as deployed on the International Space Station.\nRaj: Don\xe2\x80\x99t you mean the Wolowitz Zero-Gravity Human Waste Distribution System?\nLeonard: Good one.\nRaj: Yeah.\nHoward: Yeah, ha, it\xe2\x80\x99s hilarious. Now, here\xe2\x80\x99s an approximation of the spare parts available on the Space Station. We gotta find a way, using nothing but this, to reinforce this so the waste material avoids the spinning turbine.\nRaj: You mean so it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t hit the fan?\nSheldon: Yeah, I have to say, I thought the toilet humour would get less funny with repetition. Apparently, there is no law of diminishing comedic returns with space poop. (There is a knock on the door)\nStuart: Hey Leonard.\nLeonard: Hey Stuart.\nStuart: You busy?\nLeonard: Um\xe2\x80\xa6\nHoward: Classified, Leonard.\nLeonard: Yeah, it\xe2\x80\x99s a regular Manhattan Project. What\xe2\x80\x99s up?\nStuart: Well, tonight\xe2\x80\x99s my date with Penny and since we haven\xe2\x80\x99t been able to connect by phone\xe2\x80\xa6\nLeonard: Yeah, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, it\xe2\x80\x99s been broken.\nStuart: Or e-mail.\nLeonard: Yeah, that too. Everything\xe2\x80\x99s broken.\nStuart: Anyway, I was just wondering if you had any last-minute advice.\nLeonard: All right, well, off the top of my head, I think the most important thing with Penny is to go really slow. I mean, glacial.\nStuart: Okay.\nLeonard: You know, guys come onto her all the time, so, you need to, like, set yourself apart. You know, be a little shy, don\xe2\x80\x99t make too much eye contact. And, you know, treat her with, like, cool detachment and, and, and, you know, fear.\nStuart: Fear?\nLeonard: Yeah, like, you\xe2\x80\x99re afraid that if you touch her, she\xe2\x80\x99ll break.\nStuart: Well, that plays right into my wheelhouse.\nLeonard: Good, good. Well, you kids have fun tonight.\nStuart: Thanks, Leonard. What is that thing anyway?\nHoward: You don\xe2\x80\x99t know what this is?\nStuart: No.\nHoward: Good. Get out.\nRaj: Be afraid of Penny, nice, very crafty.\nLeonard: It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t bad advice. It just wasn\xe2\x80\x99t particularly helpful.\nSheldon: For what it\xe2\x80\x99s worth, my mother says that when we deceive for personal gain, we make Jesus cry.\nScene: Later.\nSheldon: All right, what if we use this two-inch PVC to reinforce the centre cross-support?\nHoward: No good. I mean, it might work for the Japanese and the Americans, but have you seen the size of the Russians they got up there? This thing has to hold up against a hearty potato-based diet.\nLeonard: I feel terrible.\nHoward: Maybe if you were helping, you\xe2\x80\x99d feel better about yourself.\nLeonard: I deliberately tried to sabotage Stuart\xe2\x80\x99s date with Penny.\nRaj: Of course you feel terrible. You completely screwed up your karma, dude.\nSheldon: You don\xe2\x80\x99t really believe in that superstition, do you?\nRaj: It\xe2\x80\x99s not superstition. It\xe2\x80\x99s practically Newtonian. For every action, there\xe2\x80\x99s an equal and opposite reaction. Leonard pretends to be a friend and acts like a two-faced bitch, therefore, he is reborn as a banana slug. It\xe2\x80\x99s actually a very elegant system, you know, what goes around comes around.\nHoward: Speaking of what goes around comes around\xe2\x80\xa6\nRaj: Okay, look. Instead of trying to reinforce this structure here, what if we just ran another line, bypass it entirely?\nSheldon: It won\xe2\x80\x99t work. The diameter of the tubing is insufficient.\nRaj: What if we reposition the collection tank?\nSheldon: It won\xe2\x80\x99t work. No way to mount it.\nHoward: Okay, here\xe2\x80\x99s an idea. What if I change my name and go live with my cousin and her husband Avi in Israel?\nSheldon: That could work.\nScene: Outside Penny\xe2\x80\x99s door. Leonard knocks, Penny answers in her dressing gown.\nLeonard: Morning.\nPenny: Morning. What\xe2\x80\x99s up?\nLeonard: Nothing. We just pulled an all-nighter trying to fix a zero-gravity\xe2\x80\xa6 pasta maker. I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna make a coffee run. Do you want any?\nPenny: Oh, no, thanks. I have coffee.\nLeonard: Great. So how\xe2\x80\x99d it go with Stuart last night?\nPenny: I really don\xe2\x80\x99t want to talk about it.\nLeonard: Yeah. Right. Sure. The thing is, before you guys went out, I spoke to him and\xe2\x80\xa6\nPenny: I said I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to talk about it.\nLeonard: Okay\xe2\x80\xa6 I just\xe2\x80\xa6 I kind of\xe2\x80\xa6\nPenny: Look, Leonard, what goes on between me and Stuart is none of your business. So just leave it alone, okay?\nRaj: If you really want to clean up your karma, go get my freakin\xe2\x80\x99 latte.\nScene: The apartment.\nHoward: Hang on, I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve got this. Help me see if we can wedge this little piece of PVC behind the support rod.\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re overestimating the tensile strength of the substructure you\xe2\x80\x99re building.\nHoward: Sheldon, I know what I\xe2\x80\x99m doing.\nSheldon: If you knew what you were doing, there wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be a space toilet where my coffee table should be.\nRaj: Howard, wait. Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you use this instead of the PVC to keep the transverse filter assembly in place?\nHoward: Because this is not a spare part from the space station. This is the thing from the pizza box that keeps the lid from touching the cheese.\nRaj: That what that\xe2\x80\x99s for? In India, the lid just touches the cheese. Of course, we also have rampant poverty and periodic outbreaks of cholera, so a little cardboard in our cheese is no biggie.\nHoward: Where are you going?\nLeonard: Comic book store.\nSheldon: Oh, an excellent idea! I could certainly use a break.\nRaj: Me, too.\nHoward: Hold on, you can go to the comic book store when man can once again safely poop in space.\nSheldon: Why does Leonard get to go?\nLeonard: \xe2\x80\x98Cause he\xe2\x80\x99s upset over his situation with Penny and if I have to hear about it again, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to kick him in his ovaries.\nLeonard: Thanks for understanding, Howard.\nHoward: I got your back, sister. All right, I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a prototype ready to test. Hand me that Tupperware.\nRaj: Wow, that\xe2\x80\x99s heavy.\nHoward: Damn right it\xe2\x80\x99s heavy, it\xe2\x80\x99s my mother\xe2\x80\x99s meat loaf, it\xe2\x80\x99s been testing toilets for generations.\nSheldon: I must say, Howard, I think a detailed letter to MIT describing your current circumstances might entitle you to a refund on your master\xe2\x80\x99s degree.\nHoward: Okay, simulated zero-gravity human waste disposal test with meat loaf analog in three, two, one. (Switches flush. Meatloaf hits ceiling.)\nSheldon: Fascinating.\nRaj: What do you think the problem is?\nHoward: Not enough bread crumbs.\nScene: The comic book store.\nLeonard: Hey, Stuart, I need to talk to you.\nStuart: Sure, what\xe2\x80\x99s up?\nLeonard: I think I gave you bad advice about Penny, and I want to apologize.\nStuart: No, your advice was great.\nLeonard: It was?\nStuart: Yeah, going slow really worked.\nLeonard: You\xe2\x80\x99re kidding. Never worked for me.\nStuart: Yeah, last night at dinner, I did what you told me, I went really slow, I kept my distance, and two bottles of wine later, we were making out in my car.\nLeonard: Wine? I didn\xe2\x80\x99t say to give her wine.\nStuart: It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter, that\xe2\x80\x99s where it all went to hell.\nLeonard: During the kissing? What did you do, sneeze in her mouth? I did that to a girl once.\nStuart: No, everything was good and really hot, and I said \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Penny,\xe2\x80\x9d and right where she was supposed to say, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Stuart,\xe2\x80\x9d she said\xe2\x80\xa6 your name.\nLeonard: Leonard?\nStuart: That is your name, right?\nLeonard: Yeah, no, yeah, wow, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. That must\xe2\x80\x99ve been the last thing you wanted to hear.\nStuart: Well, it beats you know I\xe2\x80\x99m a dude, right? Yeah, it was pretty bad.\nLeonard: No doubt, no doubt. Okay, well, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry it didn\xe2\x80\x99t work out.\nStuart: Not your fault.\nLeonard: Yeah, how about that? See you soon.\nStuart: Yeah, sure.\nScene: The apartment. Howard is on the phone.\n  Howard: Yes, sir, I understand classified. We\xe2\x80\x99ll keep it all classified, no one has to know but you and me.\nPenny: What\xe2\x80\x99s classified?\nLeonard: Howard\xe2\x80\x99s space toilet. I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you later.\nHoward: Well, they\xe2\x80\x99ve deployed our solution. Let\xe2\x80\x99s just all hope it works.\nSheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t see why I have to worry. My career\xe2\x80\x99s not hanging in the balance. That was a joke. It\xe2\x80\x99s funny, because it\xe2\x80\x99s true.\nPenny: Leonard, could you pass the soy sauce, please?\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, were you talking to me?\nPenny: Yeah, I said Leonard.\nLeonard: Yes, you did, didn\xe2\x80\x99t you?\nPenny: What the hell is that?\nHoward: Meatloaf.\nLeonard: What was it doing on the ceiling?\nHoward: That\xe2\x80\x99s classified.\nScene: The International Space Station.\nVoice: Houston, International Space Station. We have a little situation up here. We\xe2\x80\x99d like to make an unscheduled space walk.\nHouston: ISS, Houston. Which crew members would be involved in this E.V.A.?\nISS voice: Houston, we\xe2\x80\x99d all like to step outside for a few minutes.\nHouston: ISS, I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid we can\xe2\x80\x99t authorize that.\nISS voice: Uh, Houston, this is more of an FYI call. We are basically out the door.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
