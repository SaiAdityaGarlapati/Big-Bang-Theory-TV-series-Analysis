b'Scene: The apartment. Leonard is laying out wine and napkins in front of his laptop.\nSheldon: What are you doing?\nLeonard: Oh, uh, Priya\xe2\x80\x99s calling in a few minutes on Skype, and we are gonna have a dinner date.\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning in Mumbai. How can she have dinner?\nLeonard: Fine, whatever. Priya will be having breakfast.\nSheldon: All right, so technically it\xe2\x80\x99s not a dinner date. I suppose you could call it a, uh, dinfast date. But if you did, you\xe2\x80\x99d open yourself to peer-based mocking, such as, Hey, Leonard, how was your dinfast with Priya last night?\nLeonard: That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t sound like mocking.\nSheldon: You didn\xe2\x80\x99t let me finish. Dinfast (rolls eyes). Are those soy-based candles?\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Why?\nSheldon: Paraffin candles may contain carcinogens. Unless lung cancer is the ambiance you were going for at your dinfast. Dinfast (rolls eyes).\nLeonard: Listen, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be rude, but Priya\xe2\x80\x99s gonna be calling any minute, so\xe2\x80\xa6\nSheldon: Oh, yes, Priya. Leonard, you know I make a point of never interfering in your personal affairs.\nLeonard: Yes, I\xe2\x80\x99ve always admired that about you.\nSheldon: As well you should. But I\xe2\x80\x99m going to make an exception here.\nLeonard: Oh, good.\nSheldon: Priya has moved back to India to pursue her law career. Instead of desperately trying to keep this intercontinental relationship alive, you could use that time to take up a hobby.\nLeonard: A hobby?\nSheldon: Yes. I read recently about a fellow in Kansas with an enormous ball of twine. I bet you could give him a run for his money.\nLeonard: You know, some people might say that it\xe2\x80\x99s great that we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to make things work long distance. They\xe2\x80\x99d say things like, love is stronger than the miles between you.\nSheldon: When I rise to power, those people will be sterilized.\nLeonard: You video-chat with Amy all the time. How is this different?\nSheldon: Don\xe2\x80\x99t you like Amy?\nLeonard: Of course I like Amy.\nSheldon: Well, there\xe2\x80\x99s the difference. (Skype tone rings)\nLeonard: Excuse me, that\xe2\x80\x99s Priya.\nPriya (on screen): Hi, Leonard.\nLeonard: Hey, honey.\nPriya: I miss you.\nLeonard: Oh, I miss you, too.\nSheldon: I miss the old days when your romantic partners could be returned to the video store.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nSheldon: Thanks for letting me stay here while Leonard Skypes with his girlfriend.\nPenny: Oh, it\xe2\x80\x99s no problem. It\xe2\x80\x99s actually kind of nice. You reading, me reading. We\xe2\x80\x99re like an old married couple.\nSheldon: If we were an old married couple, the wife would serve iced tea and snickerdoodles.\nPenny: I don\xe2\x80\x99t have iced tea and snickerdoodles.\nSheldon: A good wife would go to the store.\nPenny: I want a divorce.\nSheldon: Good. On the way to see the lawyer, pick up some tea and cookies. I must say, I am enjoying your new chair.\nPenny: It\xe2\x80\x99s great, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\nSheldon: It is. Aligns the lumbar, cradles the coccyx, balances the buttocks. This is a chair worthy of the name.\nPenny: What name?\nSheldon: Chair.\nPenny: Oh, all right, well, I\xe2\x80\x99m glad you like it. I mean, I still can\xe2\x80\x99t get over the fact someone just threw it away.\nSheldon: What?\nPenny: Yeah, it was just sitting on the street. I paid a homeless guy ten bucks to help me get it up here.\nSheldon (jumps up): Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Oh, dear. (Starts stripping off clothing)\nPenny: What is wrong?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99ve been sitting in garbage!\nPenny: Sheldon, take it easy.\nSheldon: You take it easy! I need to use your shower.\nPenny: I went into this marriage with so much hope.\nSheldon: There\xe2\x80\x99s a wet Band-Aid on the shower floor. (Runs out of apartment).\nCredits sequence.\nScene: Howard\xe2\x80\x99s workshop.\nRaj: This is fun. I\xe2\x80\x99ve never used a hydraulic thermoforming press before.\nHoward: Pretty sweet, huh? This little baby set the university back 175 grand.\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99s three minutes. Should we see what we got?\nHoward: Hang on.\nRaj: Oh, yeah. This is one good-looking panini.\nHoward: Hand me the tuna melt.\nLeonard: Yep.\nHoward: Thank you. How\xe2\x80\x99s it going with the long-distance love affair?\nLeonard: Not easy, but we\xe2\x80\x99re making it work.\nHoward: When you say making it work, does that include doing the cyber nasty?\nLeonard: What?\nHoward: You know, the virtual pickle tickle. The digital bow-chicka-bow-bow.\nRaj: Come on, dude. This is my sister you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about.\nHoward: Hey, Leonard jiggling his junk at her through a webcam has got to be easier for you to deal with than him actually touching her with it.\nLeonard: There\xe2\x80\x99s no junk jiggling. We just talk.\nHoward: Are you insane? With high-speed Internet, you have at your fingertips the greatest advancement in the field of sex since the invention of the washcloth.\nLeonard: I can\xe2\x80\x99t do that.\nHoward: Well, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t, you\xe2\x80\x99re gonna lose Priya to some fancy guy in a turban who grew up with Kama Sutra coloring books.\nRaj: How can you be so racist?\nHoward: Oh, come on, tell me I\xe2\x80\x99m wrong.\nSheldon (entering): Oh, Leonard, good. There you are. I need you to check my head for chair lice.\nLeonard: I did it last night, I\xe2\x80\x99m not doing it again.\nHoward: Just his head, right?\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to talk about it. You didn\xe2\x80\x99t catch bugs from Penny\xe2\x80\x99s chair.\nSheldon: Yes, I did. And now they\xe2\x80\x99re cavorting at the base of my hair follicles like dancing hippies at the Redwood National Forest.\nLeonard: Sheldon, you do this all the time. You fixate on some crazy idea and then blow it way out of proportion.\nSheldon: Name one time I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever done that.\nLeonard: How about when you put GPS trackers in your garbage because you were convinced North Korean spies were stealing your doodles? The chicken nuggets you were sure were human nuggets. The strangely-shaped cloud that was following you around town. The time you put on my shirt by mistake and were convinced you\xe2\x80\x99d started growing again.\nSheldon: I said, name one. You really need to work on your listening skills.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment door.\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny.\nPenny: Yello.\nSheldon: You need to remove that chair from the building. It\xe2\x80\x99s a health hazard.\nPenny: Okay, relax. I took off the slipcovers, had them dry-cleaned and then fumigated the cushions.\nSheldon: Really?\nPenny: Yeah. It\xe2\x80\x99s cleaner than my couch. Found half a Hot Pocket in there.\nSheldon: It certainly looks okay. Has a strong toxic chemical smell. That\xe2\x80\x99s reassuring.\nPenny: Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you give it a try, Sheldon?\nSheldon: All right. It is a comfortable chair.\nPenny: Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you just admit you overreacted?\nSheldon: No, thank you. (Sees insect. More appear and swarm all over him. He jumps out of a daydream on his own couch. Jumps up and runs out to Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s like living with a Chihuahua.\nSheldon (at Penny\xe2\x80\x99s door): (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny.\nPenny: What\xe2\x80\x99s up, buttercup?\nSheldon: You have to get rid of the chair.\nPenny: Nope. (Closes door)\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny.\nPenny: What\xe2\x80\x99s the word, hummingbird?\nSheldon: For your safety, please wait in my apartment as I call the authorities so they may remove the chair of death.\nPenny: No. (Closes door)\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny.\nPenny: What\xe2\x80\x99s the gist, physicist?\nSheldon: Under my authority as a self-appointed member of the Centres for Disease Control street team, these premises are condemned. (Penny tries to close door) As a man with a keen sense of style, I must tell you, that chair does not work with the room. (Penny closes door). (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Penny opens door and waves seat cushion at him. He screams and runs off. She closes door. He sneaks back) (Knock, knock, knock) Penny.\nScene: Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom.\nLeonard: So, here we are. Back in bed together.\nPriya (on laptop screen): Yep, here we are.\nLeonard: Okay, so I, I, I guess I\xe2\x80\x99ll just jump right in.\nPriya: All right.\nLeonard: Uh, you\xe2\x80\x99re a naughty girl. And, and, uh, I, I want to punish you with my love?\nPriya: What?\nLeonard: Not good?\nPriya: That\xe2\x80\x99s terrible. Try again.\nLeonard: Okay. Uh, uh, you\xe2\x80\x99re not naughty. Uh, you\xe2\x80\x99re, you\xe2\x80\x99re, you\xe2\x80\x99re dirty. You\xe2\x80\x99re, you\xe2\x80\x99re a, a dirty girl?\nPriya: Oh, yes. Yes, I am.\nLeonard: Yeah, yeah. Uh, okay. You\xe2\x80\x99re a, you\xe2\x80\x99re a, you\xe2\x80\x99re a, a dirty, disgusting, revolting girl. Ugh!\nPriya: God, Leonard, stop talking.\nLeonard: Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you just give me five minutes? I\xe2\x80\x99ll Google how to do this. I\xe2\x80\x99ll call you right back.\nPriya: Shh-shh-shh. Just be quiet and do what I tell you.\nLeonard: Okay, like usual. Good.\nPriya: Take off your shirt.\nLeonard: All rightie. Shirt coming off. Ta-da! Man nipples.\nPriya: I said be quiet.\nLeonard: Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\nPriya: Now take off your shorts.\nLeonard: Taking shorts off. There we go. Naked, naked, naked!\nPriya: Wonderful. Now I\xe2\x80\x99ll take off my clothes.\nLeonard: Cool. (computer screen bugs out) Uh-oh!\nPriya: Here I am, baby. You miss these?\nLeonard: Oh, damn it!\nPriya: Oh, Leonard! Already?\nLeonard: No, no! No-no-no! The screen froze. It\xe2\x80\x99s probably just buffering, just give it a second.\nPriya: Fine.\nLeonard: So, how are your mom and dad?\nPriya: Yeah, I really don\xe2\x80\x99t want to talk about my parents now.\nLeonard: Yeah. Sure, sure.\nSheldon (calling from outside): If your video\xe2\x80\x99s frozen, try resetting the TCP/IP stack.\nLeonard: Oh! I didn\xe2\x80\x99t even think of that. Thanks.\nSheldon (still off): You\xe2\x80\x99re welcome. Please let me know when you and your girlfriend are done hogging the bandwidth for your self-abuse. I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to stream a movie on Netflix in here.\nScene: Amy\xe2\x80\x99s apartment. Amy is playing a harp.\nAmy: Five, six, seven, eight. Tall and tan and young and lovely, the girl from Ipanema goes walking, and when she passes, each one she passes goes\xe2\x80\xa6\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy.\nAmy: Oh\xe2\x80\xa6 You are aware that your ritualistic knocking behaviour is symptomatic of obsessive compulsive disorder?\nSheldon: Is not. Is not, is not.\nAmy: Denial. Denial, denial. Come in.\nSheldon: Thank you.\nAmy: Would you like to hear me play a bossa nova standard on the harp?\nSheldon: No.\nAmy: How about the theme song to the classic television show Diff\xe2\x80\x99rent Strokes? Now the world don\xe2\x80\x99t move to the beat\xe2\x80\xa6\nSheldon: No.\nAmy: Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s every song I know. What\xe2\x80\x99s up?\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re good friends with Penny, right?\nAmy: Best friends, besties, BFFs, peas in a pod, sisters who would share travelling pants. Go on.\nSheldon: I was hoping she might listen to you about the dangers of owning unhygienic furniture.\nAmy: For general educational purposes, or has she acquired a bar stool dipped in cholera?\nSheldon: Cholera is water-borne. You\xe2\x80\x99re mocking me.\nAmy: Yes, I am.\nSheldon: Penny has dragged a chair in off the street whose unknown provenance jeopardizes the health and welfare of every resident in our building.\nAmy: Sheldon, just because you have a focus on cleanliness bordering on the psychotic doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean I have to participate.\nSheldon: All right, name your price.\nAmy: Kiss me where I\xe2\x80\x99ve never been kissed before.\nSheldon: You mean like Salt Lake City?\nAmy: Never mind. I\xe2\x80\x99ll talk to Penny.\nSheldon: Thank you.\nAmy: Will you listen to me play my harp now?\nSheldon: No. I dislike the sound of the harp. Its overuse in classic television sitcoms always makes me think I\xe2\x80\x99m going to experience an episode from my past. (Amy plays glissando) I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, Mommy. Don\xe2\x80\x99t be mad at me. Don\xe2\x80\x99t do that!\nScene: Howard\xe2\x80\x99s workshop.\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know about this, Howard.\nHoward: What? You\xe2\x80\x99re having trouble with the long-distance lovemaking. This is your answer. There are two interfaces that simulate a human mouth. You have one, Priya has one in India. When you move your lips and tongue on yours, it transmits exactly what you\xe2\x80\x99re doing to hers. See? Internet kissing. (Howard kisses device) Give it a try.\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t think so.\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99ll try it. Like this?\nHoward: Almost. Really get your tongue in there, to activate the motion sensor.\nRaj: Like this?\nHoward: Close. Really French it.\nRaj: Better?\nHoward: Yeah, you got it, you got it.\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99m impressed. This is very lifelike.\nHoward: Whoa! You just bit my tongue!\nRaj: I, I nibbled. I was being playful.\nHoward: Why do you have to make everything weird?\nRaj: Sorry. Better?\nHoward: Oh, yeah.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nPenny: Pretty cool, huh? Probably would cost, like, two hundred bucks in a store.\nAmy: I do appreciate a bargain. This entire ensemble once belonged to my dead grandmother.\nPenny: You\xe2\x80\x99re kidding.\nAmy: Everything except bra and panties. And they\xe2\x80\x99re a leopard-spotted secret I share with Victoria.\nPenny: And now me.\nAmy: I just have one question about the chair.\nPenny: And what\xe2\x80\x99s that?\nAmy: Aren\xe2\x80\x99t you worried about it being unhygienic?\nPenny: No, it\xe2\x80\x99s completely fine. Hmm. I get it. Sheldon sent you. He put you up to this.\nAmy: No, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t.\nPenny: Really?\nAmy: Yes, he did. He absolutely did.\nPenny: My God, Amy, that\xe2\x80\x99s really crappy of you.\nAmy: It is?\nPenny: Yeah! Letting Sheldon use you to manipulate me? I thought you were my friend.\nAmy: No, I am your friend. Please don\xe2\x80\x99t be mad at me.\nPenny: I can\xe2\x80\x99t even believe this. You know, maybe you should just go.\nAmy: No, no, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, I\xe2\x80\x99m so sorry. I take it all back. Look. I\xe2\x80\x99m, uh, I\xe2\x80\x99m sitting in your chair. There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing wrong with it. It\xe2\x80\x99s a great chair. Please let me continue to be part of your world. Ow!\nPenny: What\xe2\x80\x99s wrong?\nAmy: Something in the chair\xe2\x80\x99s biting my tushy. It\xe2\x80\x99s not important. Ow!\nPenny: Wait. Get up, get up! (She does. Something is moving in the seat cushion. They both run out of the apartment screaming.) Swear you won\xe2\x80\x99t tell Sheldon what happened!\nAmy (between screams): I swear! Can I tell my doctor? I\xe2\x80\x99m probably gonna need shots!\nPenny (also still screaming): Yeah, sure!\nScene: Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom.\nLeonard: Oh, hey, babe, I think I figured this thing out.\nPriya (on screen): Oh, Leonard, listen\xe2\x80\xa6\nLeonard: No, you listen. You\xe2\x80\x99re my woman, and I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna make you feel things you have never felt before.\nPriya: Leonard\xe2\x80\xa6\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99s right, say my name, and beg me for more, \xe2\x80\x99cause, I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna give it to you.\nPriya: My parents are here.\nDr Koothrappali: Hello, Leonard, if I may also say your name.\nScene: The street outside the apartment block.\nHoward: Check it out. Free chair.\nRaj: Yeah. Hey, you know, if this was in Sheldon and Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s apartment, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t wind up sitting on the floor all the time.\nHoward: On three?\nTogether: Three!\nRaj: What kind of idiot throws away a terrific chair like this?\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
