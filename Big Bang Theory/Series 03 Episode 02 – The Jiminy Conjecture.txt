b'Scene: The comic book store.\nHoward: Sheldon, you\xe2\x80\x99re wrong. Wolverine was not born with bone claws.\nSheldon: Howard, you know me to be a very smart man. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you think if I were wrong, I\xe2\x80\x99d know it?\nHoward: Okay, first of all\xe2\x80\xa6\nRaj: Give it up, dude, you\xe2\x80\x99re arguing with a crazy person.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m not crazy. My mother had me tested.\nLeonard: Hey, guys.\nHoward: What are you doing here?\nLeonard: What do you mean? It\xe2\x80\x99s new comic book night.\nRaj: Yeah, but since you and Penny finally hooked up, we thought you two would be having bouncy naked yum-yum night.\nLeonard: There\xe2\x80\x99s more to life than sex, Raj.\nHoward: Okay, who had Leonard flames out with Penny in less than 24 hours\xe2\x80\x9d?\nSheldon: I did.\nLeonard: Nothing flamed out. We don\xe2\x80\x99t have to have sex every night, you know.\nHoward: You don\xe2\x80\x99t have to, but it\xe2\x80\x99s highly recommended.\nRaj: Yeah, take advantage of that window of opportunity before it slams shut on your little dinky.\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s not a matter of opportunity. We\xe2\x80\x99re getting to know each other. There\xe2\x80\x99s a learning curve.\nHoward: What\xe2\x80\x99s there to learn? You get naked, do nasty things to each other, then somebody makes scrambled eggs and salami. Easy peasy.\nSheldon: Perhaps what Leonard is obliquely referring to is the occurrence of some sort of sexual dysfunction.\nRaj: Okay, who had Leonard gets a floppy disk?\nSheldon: Oh, a clever, albeit obsolete, euphemism for insufficient blood flow to the male sex organ.\nLeonard: Nothing like that happened, all right? The sex was just fine.\nRaj: Just fine? Oh, dude, the fourth Harry Potter movie was just fine.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m not saying it was bad, I\xe2\x80\x99m just saying it\xe2\x80\xa6 wasn\xe2\x80\x99t great.\nHoward: Okay, when you say \xe2\x80\x9cit wasn\xe2\x80\x99t great, do you mean for both of you? Because we can totally see it not being great for her. Am I right?\nRaj: Oh, yeah.\nLeonard: To tell you the truth, I think we were both a little, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know\xe2\x80\xa6\nRaj: Disappointed? Let down?\nHoward: Ashamed? Horrified? Repulsed?\nLeonard: All I know is, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the way I dreamed it would be.\nHoward: Sex is never the way I dream it\xe2\x80\x99s gonna be.\nRaj: That\xe2\x80\x99s because in your dreams you\xe2\x80\x99re a horse from the waist down.\nSheldon: Excuse me, Wolverine: Origin. Miniseries issue two, page 22. Retractable bone claws. If you people spent less time thinking about sex and more time concentrating on comic books, we\xe2\x80\x99d have far fewer of these embarrassing moments.\nCredits Sequence\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: Sheldon, dinner\xe2\x80\x99s here.\nSheldon: Tandoori Palace?\nLeonard: No, we went somewhere new.\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re good-naturedly ribbing me, aren\xe2\x80\x99t you?\nLeonard: No, look, Mumbai Palace.\nSheldon: Why? Why would we change? We had a perfectly good palace. Tandoori Palace is our palace.\nLeonard: Trust me, this will be just fine.\nHoward: You are the authority on just fine.\nLeonard: What\xe2\x80\x99s that supposed to mean?\nHoward (after Raj whispers to him): Yeah, exactly. Not bad, but not great.\nPenny: What are they talking about?\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know\nSheldon: I know. As I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you\xe2\x80\x99re aware\xe2\x80\xa6\nLeonard: Duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh.\nSheldon: If that\xe2\x80\x99s Morse code, that\xe2\x80\x99s terrible. As I was saying, you and Leonard had a disappointing sexual encounter. Earlier this evening, Leonard characterized it as just fine. So what you\xe2\x80\x99re seeing here is a continuation of the mocking that followed.\nPenny: Okay, yeah, well, I\xe2\x80\x99m just gonna go eat my dinner elsewhere. Maybe an airplane headed for a mountainside.\nLeonard: Penny, wait. Aagh! What is wrong with you?\nSheldon: I sense I may have crossed some sort of line.\nRaj: Yeah, you\xe2\x80\xa6\nHoward: Uh, no, no, no, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell him, let\xe2\x80\x99s see if he can figure it out.\nPenny: Ugh, I am so embarrassed!\nLeonard: Please don\xe2\x80\x99t be mad.\nPenny: What did you tell them?\nLeonard: Nothing bad, just that last night was fine.\nPenny: Fine? You said it was fine?\nLeonard: Yeah, it\xe2\x80\x99s a perfectly good word. You put it in front of wine or dining, and you\xe2\x80\x99ve really got something. Okay, well, let me ask you this, how was last night for you?\nPenny: It was\xe2\x80\xa6 okay.\nLeonard: Okay?\nPenny: Yeah, it\xe2\x80\x99s a perfectly good word. I mean, you put it in front of dokay and you really got something. All right, look, let\xe2\x80\x99s not overreact, you know? For a lot of couples, it takes time to get to know each other\xe2\x80\x99s rhythms. Learn what the other person wants and likes.\nLeonard: So, you\xe2\x80\x99ve been through this before?\nPenny: No.\nLeonard: Okay-dokay.\nPenny: You know, I think this is one of those things where talking about it is not going to make it better. Want a glass of wine?\nLeonard: So much.\nPenny: Okay. See, we should\xe2\x80\x99ve done this last night, you know, have a little wine, take the edge off.\nLeonard: Actually, ethyl alcohol inhibits electrical conduction in the nerve cells and stimulates reuptake receptors of inhibitory neurotransmitters like gamma-aminobutyric acid.\nPenny: Don\xe2\x80\x99t talk, just drink.\nHoward: No, you\xe2\x80\x99re misunderstanding. A shiksa goddess isn\xe2\x80\x99t an actual goddess and we don\xe2\x80\x99t pray to them, we prey on them.\nRaj: Whatever, dude. The point is, Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s got one and you don\xe2\x80\x99t.\nSheldon: Is this it? It was inappropriate to discuss Leonard and Penny\xe2\x80\x99s sex life in front of Leonard and Penny. (Howard indicates that he has got it.) Oh, good! Now I can eat.\nRaj: What\xe2\x80\x99s that?\nHoward: Sounds like a cricket.\nSheldon: Hang on. Based on the number of chirps per minute and the ambient temperature in this room, it is a snowy tree cricket.\nHoward: Oh, give me a frickin\xe2\x80\x99 break. How could you possibly know that?\nSheldon: In 1890, Emile Dolbear determined that there was a fixed relationship between the number of chirps per minute of the snowy tree cricket and the ambient temperature. A precise relationship that is not present with ordinary field crickets.\nRaj: How do you know what the exact temperature of the room is?\nSheldon: Under the terms of my roommate agreement with Leonard, I\xe2\x80\x99ve had unilateral control of the thermostat ever since the sweaty night of \xe2\x80\x9906.\nHoward: Okay, you were right about Wolverine and bone claws, but you\xe2\x80\x99re wrong about the cricket.\nSheldon: Howard, don\xe2\x80\x99t embarrass yourself, the science chirps for itself. Humorous word play.\nHoward: No, no, not this time. I know insects, my friend, I spent many childhood years capturing them with nets, putting them in glass jars, sticking pins through them, mounting them on corrugated cardboard with Dymo labels underneath, identifying the genus and species. In Latin.\nRaj: Oh, dude, you are never getting a shiksa goddess.\nSheldon: That is a snowy tree cricket. Oecanthus fultoni. I was done with Latin by fifth grade.\nHoward: Okay, okay, tell you what. I am willing to bet anything that\xe2\x80\x99s an ordinary field cricket.\nSheldon: I can\xe2\x80\x99t take your money.\nHoward: What\xe2\x80\x99s the matter, you chicken?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99ve always found that an inappropriate slur. Chickens are not, by nature, at all timid. In fact, when I was young, my neighbour\xe2\x80\x99s chicken got loose and chased me up the big elm tree in front of our house.\nRaj: Chickens can\xe2\x80\x99t climb trees\nSheldon: Thank God.\nHoward: Okay, I believe a chicken made you his bitch. But the cricket thing, I don\xe2\x80\x99t buy. Bet me.\nSheldon: Fair enough. What stake do you propose?\nHoward: I will put up my Fantastic Four number 48, first appearance of Silver Surfer against your Flash 123, the classic Flash of two worlds issue.\nSheldon: All right, you have a wager.\nHoward: Hmm.\nRaj: Great. Now how are you going to settle it, hmm? There is no way to determine the species of the cricket without examining it.\nSlight time shift. The guys are searching for the cricket.\nRaj: I wonder what the non-pathetic people are doing tonight.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment, Penny and Leonard are kissing. They break and look at each other uncomfortably.\nLeonard: More wine?\nPenny: Hit me.\nScene: The apartment, the guys are still searching for the cricket. They are inside the cupboard.\nSheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t see anything.\nHoward: Shh!\nRaj: Hallway. (All try to exit at once and get stuck in doorway.)\nSheldon: One at a time. (Same thing happens again. Eventually they leave the apartment. There is a growling noise.) What was that?\nRaj: My stomach. Indian food doesn\xe2\x80\x99t agree with me. Ironic, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\nHoward: Shh! Elevator shaft.\nSheldon: Help me open it.\nHoward: Are you crazy? We can\xe2\x80\x99t go down an empty elevator shaft.\nSheldon: Fine, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to proceed, then you forfeit the bet, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll take possession of your Fantastic Four.\nHoward: Let\xe2\x80\x99s open her up.\nSheldon: Are you bothered that I can so easily manipulate you?\nHoward: Don\xe2\x80\x99t push me, Sheldon. I may be small, but I took kung fu when I was 13, and I remember a good deal of it.\nSheldon: Oh, really? Well, I grew up with an older brother and a very contentious twin sister and I believe I could easily best you in any physical confrontation, be it noogies, swirlies or the classic why are you hitting yourself?\nRaj: Ooh, big talk from a man who was once treed by a chicken.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nLeonard: What are we drinking now?\nPenny: Peppermint schnapps.\nLeonard: Why would you buy peppermint schnapps?\nPenny: Because I like peppermint, and it\xe2\x80\x99s fun to say schnapps. Hey, Leonard?\nLeonard: What?\nPenny: Schnapps.\nLeonard: Schnapps. You\xe2\x80\x99re right, that is fun.\nScene: The elevator shaft. Sheldon is inside.\nRaj: Be careful.\nSheldon: If I were not being careful, your telling me to be careful would not make me careful.\nRaj (hearing the cricket): Stairwell.\nSheldon: Uh-oh, flashlight went out. I need some batteries. Fellas? Hello? It\xe2\x80\x99s really dark down here.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s bathroom. Leonard is vomiting in the toilet.\nPenny: Oh, sweetie. You really can\xe2\x80\x99t hold your liquor, can you?\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m okay. Just a little mouthwash, and then I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna rock your world. (Penny vomits in sink) Are you okay? (Vomits in toilet again)\nScene: The university cafeteria. Raj has the cricket in a jar.\nRaj: Ugh, Toby, what did you do in a past life to be so disgusting now?\nSheldon: His name isn\xe2\x80\x99t Toby. Toby is an absurd name for a cricket.\nRaj: What would you name him?\nSheldon: An appropriate cricket name. For example, Jiminy.\nHoward: All right, Sheldon, here we go, Kleingast\xe2\x80\x99s Field Guide to North American Insects. Hey, Toby. Right here, see it? The common field cricket, aka Gryllus assimilis, which is Latin for suck it, you lose.\nSheldon: Hang on. Voil\xc3\xa0, the snowy tree cricket, aka Oecanthus fultoni, which is Latin for I\xe2\x80\x99ll suck nothing. Of course I\xe2\x80\x99m joking because the Latin for that is nihil exsorbibo.\nHoward: That is not Toby, this is Toby. Raj, what do you think?\nRaj: Oh, I really don\xe2\x80\x99t care anymore\nLeonard: God, I had the most horrible night.\nRaj: What happened?\nSheldon: Obviously another carnal fiasco with the shiksi goddess.\nHoward: Shiksa. Shik-sa.\nSheldon: Forgive me. Yiddish was not spoken in east Texas. And if it was, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t spoken for long.\nHoward: Yeah, fine, whatever. The point is, you\xe2\x80\x99re wrong again.\nSheldon: We haven\xe2\x80\x99t established that I\xe2\x80\x99m wrong once.\nHoward: All right. Tell you what, let\xe2\x80\x99s go down to the Entomology Department and let Professor\nCrawley tell us what kind of cricket Toby is.\nSheldon: He\xe2\x80\x99s a snowy tree cricket, and his name is Jiminy. (They leave)\nLeonard: I bet I could throw a rock in this room and come up with three better friends.\nScene: The Entomology Department.\n  Raj: Holy crap. It\xe2\x80\x99s like Silence of the Lambs down here. (Howard tickles the back of his neck. He screams) Don\xe2\x80\x99t do that!\nHoward: You\xe2\x80\x99re such a girl. They\xe2\x80\x99re just bugs.\nRaj: Yeah, well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t like bugs, okay? They freak me out.\nSheldon: Interesting. You\xe2\x80\x99re afraid of insects and women. Ladybugs must render you catatonic. It was a joke. I made it to lessen your discomfort. You\xe2\x80\x99re welcome\nProf Crawley (arriving): Don\xe2\x80\x99t knock. Just walk in. Why be polite to the world\xe2\x80\x99s leading expert on the dung beetle?\nSheldon: Excuse me, are you Professor Crawley?\nProf Crawley: Who wants to know?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m Dr. Cooper from the Physics Department.\nProf Crawley: Couldn\xe2\x80\x99t wait, huh?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry?\nProf Crawley: I haven\xe2\x80\x99t even packed yet, and you\xe2\x80\x99re already measuring my lab for one of your godless laser machines.\nHoward: No, you don\xe2\x80\x99t understand. We just want to ask you a question.\nProf Crawley: Let me ask you one first. What\xe2\x80\x99s a world renowned entomologist with a doctorate and 20 years of experience to do with his life when the university cuts off the funding for his lab, huh?\nRaj: Ask rhetorical questions that make people uncomfortable?\nProf Crawley: What\xe2\x80\x99s your deal? Are they planning to outsource my job to Bangalore?\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99m from New Delhi. Maybe you should find another entomologist.\nSheldon: No, no. We\xe2\x80\x99re here, let\xe2\x80\x99s settle this. Professor, can you identify our cricket?\nProf Crawley: Of course I can. I can identify every insect and arachnid on the planet. Not that that\xe2\x80\x99s going to keep me from having to move in with my daughter in Oxnard. And we\xe2\x80\x99re not talking Oxnard at the beach. No! We\xe2\x80\x99re talking Oxnard in the onion fields.\nHoward: Well, could you look at Toby?\nProf Crawley: Toby? What a stupid name for a cricket.\nSheldon: Told you.\nProf Crawley: It\xe2\x80\x99s a field cricket.\nHoward: Yes!\nSheldon: No, no, wait. Dr. Crawley, are you sure?\nProf Crawley: Young man, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been studying insects since I was eight years old. You know what they used to call me in school? Creepy Crawley.\nSheldon: Cruel as that may be, that is not in itself a credential.\nProf Crawley: Let me show you something. See that? That\xe2\x80\x99s a Crawley\xe2\x80\x99s dung beetle. I discovered it after spending six months slogging through a Bornean rain forest, while my wife was back home shacking up with a two-bit ornithologist who lives on a sailboat and likes to wear boot-cut jeans! So, when I tell you that that\xe2\x80\x99s a common field cricket, you can take that to the damn bank! Cause God knows I can\xe2\x80\x99t. That tramp took me for everything!\nSheldon: Well, apparently, I was wrong. Congratulations.\nRaj: Enjoy Oxnard. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure your daughter\xe2\x80\x99s looking forward to having you.\nScene: The lobby.\nPenny: Oh, hey, Sheldon. What you got there? A new comic book?\nSheldon: Old comic book. I just retrieved it from my safe deposit box.\nPenny: What do you have a safe deposit box for?\nSheldon: Old comic books. I lost this to Wolowitz in an ill-considered cricket wager.\nPenny: What, do they have Wii cricket now? That can\xe2\x80\x99t be very popular.\nSheldon: Penny, I\xe2\x80\x99d rather not talk about it.\nPenny: Well, if it makes you feel any better, I\xe2\x80\x99m not feeling so hot either.\nSheldon: Why would that make me feel better?\nPenny: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, empathy? Anyway, I\xe2\x80\x99m just saying that you\xe2\x80\x99re feeling upset about something with Howard, and I\xe2\x80\x99m upset about something with Leonard.\nSheldon: Yes, yes, the disappointing sex. That\xe2\x80\x99s an inexact parallel. You and Leonard can always return to being friends, whereas I can never return to a state in which Wolowitz has not bested me like Mrs. Riley\xe2\x80\x99s chicken.\nPenny: What\xe2\x80\x99s Mrs. Riley\xe2\x80\x99s chicken?\nSheldon: A chicken that was owned by Mrs. Riley.\nPenny: Okay, forget the chicken.\nSheldon: Well, I wish I could.\nPenny: No, no. You may be right about me and Leonard.\nSheldon: Of course I\xe2\x80\x99m right What are the odds I\xe2\x80\x99d be wrong twice in one week?\nPenny: No, I mean, we can always go back to being friends.\nSheldon: I just said that. This conversation has started to circle. Meeting adjourned.\nScene: The apartment\nSheldon: Hello.\nLeonard: Hey. What\xe2\x80\x99s going on?\nSheldon: Oh, you\xe2\x80\x99d like to catch up on the events of the day. All right. Well, there was a half-hour wait at the bank to get into my safe deposit box, I was forced to talk to Penny about your sexual problems, and, oh, yes, in a moment filled with biblical resonance, pride wenteth before my fall, causing my Flash 123 to goeth to Wolowitz.\nLeonard: Wait a minute. You talked to Penny about our sex life?\nSheldon: Leonard, it astonishes me how you continually fixate on the trivial. I lost a bet to Wolowitz.\nLeonard: Right, right. You\xe2\x80\x99re saying you talked to Penny?\nSheldon:  Yes.\nLeonard: Interesting.\nSheldon: Hardly.\nLeonard: Excuse me.\nSheldon: Have I crossed some sort of line again?\nLeonard: Little bit. (Exits)\nSheldon: Hmm. Oh, who cares?\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s doorway.\nPenny: Oh, hey.\nLeonard: Hey. Uh, what did Sheldon say to you?\nPenny: Not a lot. Just that we always have the option of going back to being friends.\nLeonard: Is that what you want?\nPenny: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I mean, you have to admit things seemed simpler when we were just friends.\nLeonard: I guess.\nPenny: It would take the pressure off.\nLeonard: It would, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\nPenny: So, we\xe2\x80\x99ll just be friends.\nLeonard: Good, good.\nPenny: Come here. (She gives him a hug. It turns into a big kiss.)\n  Leonard (closing door): Okay-dokay\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
