b'Scene: Webcam conversation between Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s Office and the International Space Station\nHoward: Hey, Bernie.\nBernadette: Hey, how\xe2\x80\x99s my little astronautie hottie?\nHoward: Okay, I guess. It\xe2\x80\x99s just, being cooped up in this tin can for weeks on end is starting to get to me.\nBernadette: Well, hang in there. You just have a couple more days to go, and then you\xe2\x80\x99ll be home.\nHoward: I know.\nBernadette: I got to get back to work. I love you.\nHoward: Love you too. Hey, Bernie? Before you go, can you do something for me?\nBernadette: What do you want me to do?\nHoward: Okay, here it is. I really miss gravity. Can you drop something so I can watch it fall?\nBernadette: Really, you\xe2\x80\x99re serious? Okay. (Drops a pencil)\nHoward: Oh, baby, you\xe2\x80\x99re killing me.\nScene: The apartment. Penny enters, carrying a box.\nPenny: Ugh. Hey, Sheldon? Hi. This came for you today. It\xe2\x80\x99s from your mom.\nSheldon: Oh, thank you, Penny.\nPenny: M-hmm.\nSheldon: Yeah, wait, here. For your troubles.\nPenny: Oh, boy, a whole dollar. Now, I can quit my paper route. So, what\xe2\x80\x99s in it?\nLeonard: Mmm, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter. Half the time, he just ends up playing with the box.\nSheldon: Yeah, it\xe2\x80\x99s journals and research papers I wrote as a child.\nPenny: Aw, how cute. Is this like a diary?\nSheldon: No, that\xe2\x80\x99s my potty training journal.\nPenny: Really, your potty training journal?\nSheldon: Yeah. And forgive my crude penmanship. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t start typing until I was six.\nPenny: August 7, 8:42 a.m. This is humiliating. What was wrong with diapers?\nSheldon: There are some charts in the back where I kept track of shape, colour and consistency.\nPenny: Oh, disgusting.\nLeonard: No, what\xe2\x80\x99s disgusting is he\xe2\x80\x99s still keeping track.\nPenny: Why do you need all this stuff?\nLeonard: No, no, no, no.\nPenny: Sorry!\nSheldon: I am glad you asked. Are you familiar with the Higgs boson?\nPenny: Of course, it is, it\xe2\x80\x99s been in the news. And it\xe2\x80\x99s a very famous boson.\nSheldon: Nice try. Now, in 1964, Dr. Peter Higgs, accomplished self-promoter and physicist, he wrote a paper postulating the existence of a subatomic particle called the Higgs boson. Now, initially the paper was rejected, but recently, he was proven right, and now he\xe2\x80\x99s on the fast track to win a Nobel prize.\nPenny: Yeah, that\xe2\x80\x99s basically what I said.\nSheldon: Yeah, the point is Higgs is being celebrated for work he did 50 years ago, so that got me thinking, perhaps I\xe2\x80\x99ve already hit upon the idea that will win me my Nobel prize.\nLeonard: I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know they gave Nobel prizes for making boom-boom in the potty.\nPenny: You really think there\xe2\x80\x99s some kind of scientific discovery in here?\nSheldon: Well, this box only covers my work through nursery school. There\xe2\x80\x99s a good deal more to come. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t really hit my academic stride until I cut out that time-suck known as playing outdoors.\nLeonard: So, you\xe2\x80\x99re going to spend hours and hours combing through all this stuff?\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s a good point. My time is much too valuable. You know, perhaps I should find someone to do it for me. You know, someone with a rudimentary understanding of science, but whose real talents lie in menial labour.\nLeonard: Not gonna happen.\nSheldon: Well, if I didn\xe2\x80\x99t think you could handle it, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be asking.\nLeonard: If you want help, just hire a grad student.\nPenny: Maybe I could do it.\nSheldon: You, really? You can assess the quality of my work? Okay, um, here. I wrote this when I was five years old.\nPenny: A proof that algebraic topology can never have a non self-contradictory set of abelion groups. I\xe2\x80\x99m just a blonde monkey to you, aren\xe2\x80\x99t I?\nSheldon: You said it, not me.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s office.\nSheldon: All right, Ms. Jenson. Uh, before we begin, may I offer you a refreshment? Water, coffee, tea, a marijuana cigarette?\nMs Jenson: No, thanks. I\xe2\x80\x99m fine.\nSheldon: Now, are you sure? Everyone\xe2\x80\x99s smoking them. I think they\xe2\x80\x99re the best.\nMs Jenson: I don\xe2\x80\x99t do drugs.\nSheldon: Excellent, yeah. That was a ruse. They\xe2\x80\x99re not the best. Physics is the best. And by the way, coffee was also an unacceptable choice. All right, so I see here you\xe2\x80\x99re from Des Moines, Iowa. Uh, you\xe2\x80\x99re summa cum laude in theoretical physics from Stanford University. Oh, and two years ago, you had a persistent ear infection. I hope that didn\xe2\x80\x99t cause any hearing loss.\nMs Jenson: No, of course not. How did you know about that?\nSheldon: I did a comprehensive background check. Medical records, credit reports, criminal history. (Hiding mouth behind book) I trust you paid off those parking tickets.\nMs Jenson: Yes, I did.\nSheldon: Hearing unimpaired, good.\nMs Jenson: Look, Dr. Cooper, I really want this position. It would be an incredible honour to work for a man of your brilliance.\nSheldon: Flattery will not get you this job, Ms. Jenson.\nMs Jenson: It\xe2\x80\x99s not flattery if it\xe2\x80\x99s the truth.\nSheldon: Oh, well, thank you. Welcome aboard.\nScene: A University corridor.\nLeonard: You talk to Howard lately?\nRaj: Uh, yeah, last night. He kept making me drop pencils for him. I got uncomfortable. (Entering Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s office) Hey, Sheldon, hope you\xe2\x80\x99re hungry, they\xe2\x80\x99re serving macaroni and\xe2\x80\xa6 (spots Ms Jenson) che-ee-ee-ese.\nLeonard: Smooth. Hi.\nMs Jenson: Hello.\nLeonard: Sheldon, aren\xe2\x80\x99t you going to introduce us?\nSheldon: No. I have people for that now. You\xe2\x80\x99re up.\nMs Jenson: I\xe2\x80\x99m Alex, Dr. Cooper\xe2\x80\x99s new assistant.\nLeonard: Ah, congratulations and may God have mercy on your soul. I\xe2\x80\x99m Leonard. This is Raj.\nAlex: It\xe2\x80\x99s nice to meet you. I\xe2\x80\x99m so excited to be working with Dr\xe2\x80\xa6\nSheldon: Yeah, please reserve chitchat for your breaks, Ms. Jenson. FYI, there will be no breaks.\nAlex: I should probably get to work.\nLeonard: She seems nice.\nRaj: Hey, you already got a girlfriend. I call dibs.\nLeonard: All I said was she seems nice.\nRaj: Yeah, well, I love her.\nScene: Webcam conversation between Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s Office and the International Space Station\nBernadette: Hey, I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t expecting to hear from you today. Everything okay?\nHoward: Uh, no, not really.\nBernadette: What\xe2\x80\x99s wrong?\nHoward: Well, remember the Soyuz capsule they were sending to bring us home?\nBernadette: Uh-huh.\nHoward: It\xe2\x80\x99s delayed. We\xe2\x80\x99re gonna be here at least another week. Maybe ten days. It\xe2\x80\x99s the Russians, so you don\xe2\x80\x99t know. They left dogs up here in the sixties.\nBernadette: Come on, Howard. No one\xe2\x80\x99s leaving you up there.\nHoward: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how much longer I can take this. I can\xe2\x80\x99t sleep, and zero gravity is giving me crazy acid reflux. I\xe2\x80\x99m down to my last three Tums.\nBernadette: You\xe2\x80\x99re going to be fine. You survived that Weight Watchers cruise with your mom. And they ran out of low-fat ice cream on day two. Just calm down and take a few deep breaths.\nHoward: Okay, okay. What am I doing? I\xe2\x80\x99m using up all the oxygen. If I die, promise you\xe2\x80\x99ll never have sex with another man.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment. Amy is applying very red lip gloss.\nAmy: Oh, yeah. I\xe2\x80\x99m a man-eater now.\nPenny: Okay, for the final touch, this is an eyelash curler. You just place it on your lashes and squeeze it closed.\nAmy: Oh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Looks like something used by Tinkerbell\xe2\x80\x99s gynecologist.\nPenny: Who I hope for her sake is not Captain Hook, so\xe2\x80\xa6 who are you calling?\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99m going to video-chat Sheldon. If my new look leads to phone sex, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to have to ask you to leave the room.\nAlex: Dr. Cooper\xe2\x80\x99s office.\nAmy: Oh, hello. Who are you?\nAlex: I\xe2\x80\x99m Alex, Dr. Cooper\xe2\x80\x99s assistant. Can I help you?\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99d like to speak to Sheldon.\nAlex: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. He\xe2\x80\x99s asked me to hold all calls unless you\xe2\x80\x99re Stephen Hawking, his mother or himself from the future.\nAmy: All right. Well, tell him Amy called.\nAlex: Last name?\nAmy: He knows my last name. I\xe2\x80\x99m his girlfriend. We have a contract and everything. I\xe2\x80\x99ll send you a PDF.\nAlex: All right, I will tell him you called.\nAmy: Hmm, that\xe2\x80\x99s weird.\nPenny: What?\nAmy: Sheldon told me he had a new assistant named Alex. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t mention that Alex was a girl.\nPenny: Maybe he didn\xe2\x80\x99t notice.\nAmy: You\xe2\x80\x99re right. I don\xe2\x80\x99t have to worry about Sheldon.\nPenny: No, you do not.\nAmy: It\xe2\x80\x99s her I have to worry about.\nPenny: Oh, Amy, really? She is not going to come on to Sheldon.\nAmy: Oh, really? Look at this face (Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s picture on phone) How can any woman spend eight hours a day alone with this face and not fall in love with it?\nPenny: Well, for starters, at some point, that face starts talking.\nScene: University corridor.\nPenny: Amy, this is crazy. You have nothing to be suspicious about.\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99m not suspicious. I just want to stop in, say hi to my boyfriend and meet his new assistant. (Throwing open Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s office door) Aha!\nPenny: Can we go now?\nAmy: Hang on. (Rubs Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s telephone receiver under her armpit)\nPenny: What are you doing?\nAmy: Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it obvious? I\xe2\x80\x99m spreading my scent to mark my territory.\nPenny: Come on, Amy. That is not gonna work.\nAmy: Really? Because just before you became my best friend, I did this all over your apartment.\nScene: The cafeteria.\nRaj: Has your, uh, assistant said anything about me?\nSheldon: Oh, in fact, she has. Uh, her exact words were, what is that guy\xe2\x80\x99s problem?\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99m in her head. Let the dance begin.\nAlex: Here\xe2\x80\x99s your frozen yoghurt, Dr. Cooper.\nLeonard: This should be fun.\nSheldon: Half chocolate, half vanilla, side by side, not swirled?\nAlex: Yes.\nSheldon: Half a teaspoon of sprinkles?\nAlex: Rainbow, not chocolate.\nSheldon: Two cherries?\nAlex: One on top, one on the bottom.\nSheldon: Stems removed?\nAlex: Um, top one, yes. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t check the one on the bottom.\nLeonard: Oh!\nAlex: I\xe2\x80\x99m so sorry, Dr. Cooper.\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s all right, Alex. I\xe2\x80\x99m not mad at you, I\xe2\x80\x99m just disappointed.\nLeonard: Wait, Alex. Do you want to join us?\nAlex: Um\xe2\x80\xa6\nSheldon: Uh, Alex, a moment. I need a word with Dr. Hofstadter. Do you think it\xe2\x80\x99s appropriate for her to sit with us, given her station?\nLeonard: Given her what?\nSheldon: If I\xe2\x80\x99ve learned anything from British television shows on PBS, it\xe2\x80\x99s that servants dine downstairs with their own kind.\nLeonard: What?\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s a kindness, Leonard. Otherwise, you\xe2\x80\x99re cruelly tempting them with a glimpse of a world that\xe2\x80\x99s just beyond their soot-stained fingertips.\nLeonard: Oh, sure. Please join us.\nAlex: Oh, okay. Thank you.\nLeonard: So, Alex, what\xe2\x80\x99s the topic of your dissertation?\nAlex: I\xe2\x80\x99m looking for Trojan asteroids at Earth\xe2\x80\x99s L-Five Lagrange point.\nLeonard: Oh, that happens to be Dr. Koothrappali\xe2\x80\x99s field of expertise. You two have a lot to talk about.\nAlex: Is that true? Is he all right?\nLeonard: No. But compared to your boss, he\xe2\x80\x99s the poster boy for sanity.\nAlex: It\xe2\x80\x99s okay, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been around scientists all my life. My dad\xe2\x80\x99s an astronomer at SETI.\nLeonard: Oh, SETI, the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence. You should introduce him to Sheldon. The search is over.\nAlex: So, what kind of research are you doing?\nLeonard: High-energy lasers.\nAlex: Ooh. Military?\nLeonard: Not yet, but I can remove unwanted hair from two miles away.\nAmy (to Penny, on other side of room): You were right. I had nothing to worry about. That skank\xe2\x80\x99s your problem, not mine.\nAlex: You\xe2\x80\x99re very funny, Dr. Hofstadter.\nLeonard: Thank you.\nSheldon (choking): Cherry stem! Cherry stem!\nScene: Webcam conversation between Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s Office and the International Space Station\nBernadette: How you doing, Howie? You feeling a little better?\nHoward: Oh, a lot better, thanks. One sec. Listen close, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a lot of time. I need you to go to my house. In my bedroom, you\xe2\x80\x99ll find a model rocket. I want you to take it and bring it back to your place.\nBernadette: Okay.\nHoward: Step two, build a version roughly fourteen stories high. Fill it full of rocket fuel and come get me. I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave the door unlocked.\nBernadette: Howie, honey, maybe you should talk to someone, let them know you\xe2\x80\x99re having a little anxiety.\nHoward: No, no, I\xe2\x80\x99m fine. No anxiety. We should probably talk in code. From now on, frog is me, sandwich means you and lemon means rocket. So, come on, sandwich, build me a lemon \xe2\x80\x99cause froggy wants to come home.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s car.\nAmy: Look at you, putting on a brave face.\nPenny: There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to be brave about. Everything\xe2\x80\x99s fine.\nAmy: Really? I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how much you know about primate behaviour, but Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s assistant was clearly courting Leonard. Were she a mandrill, she would have bent over and displayed her brightly coloured hindquarters like a big red welcome mat. By the way, you try that at the junior prom, you get kicked out.\nPenny: Okay, maybe she was flirting with him, but who cares? Look, I don\xe2\x80\x99t even know where my relationship is with Leonard is right now.\nAmy: So says your prefrontal cortex. But meanwhile, the limbic system of your brain is calculating that if another woman is attracted to Leonard, it must be because he\xe2\x80\x99s desirable.\nPenny: Well, of course he\xe2\x80\x99s desirable. I mean, he\xe2\x80\x99s great. He\xe2\x80\x99s smart, he\xe2\x80\x99s sweet, and, ooh, in the bedroom, whew, let me tell you, he really tries.\nAmy: So it does bother you.\nPenny: Fine, it bothers me a little. No. You know what? This is stupid. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t bother me. Okay, it bothers me. But only because she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t stop laughing. Leonard is not that funny.\nAmy: And there you have it, prefrontal cortex reasoning versus limbic lust. If this were a boxing match, they might call it the thrilla adjacent to the amygdala. If you were a brain scientist, you would be busting a gut right now.\nScene: The apartment.\nPenny: So, how was work today?\nLeonard: Ah, it was all right, I guess. Got to Heimlich a cherry stem out of Sheldon. Caught Raj right in the eye.\nPenny: Oh! You\xe2\x80\x99re kidding.\nLeonard: No, Raj had to go to the nurse.\nPenny: Wow. Anything else?\nLeonard: Mmm, the nurse is a woman, so he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t talk to her. She had to bring him a Grover puppet so he could point at what hurt.\nPenny: Oh, is that it?\nLeonard: Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that enough? It had the weaponised fruit and a puppet. What more do you want?\nSheldon (arriving with Alex): Oh, good, Leonard, you\xe2\x80\x99re here. Science news. This will interest you. And, Penny, feel free to paint your nails.\nLeonard: What do you got?\nSheldon: I believe Alex may have unearthed the grade school science project that could be my ticket to the Nobel Prize. Behold.\nLeonard: Magnets: What Do They Stick To? If the answer is metal, it\xe2\x80\x99s not exactly groundbreaking.\nSheldon: The original title was \xe2\x80\x9cA Rederivation of Maxwell\xe2\x80\x99s Equations Regarding Electromagnetism\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x9d I dumbed it down because some of the more religious people in town were starting to say I was a witch.\nAlex: Sheldon thinks the approach in this paper might change the way we calculate ferromagnetic hysteresis.\nPenny: Oh, it\xe2\x80\x99s about time. I hated the old way. Hi. I\xe2\x80\x99m Penny.\nAlex: Alex. Uh, do you work with Dr. Hofstadter?\nPenny: In a way. We\xe2\x80\x99ve kind of been involved in a five-year experiment.\nAlex: Oh. Well, you\xe2\x80\x99re lucky. He seems very talented. And I\xe2\x80\x99m sure a lot of people want to work with him.\nPenny: Well, a lot of people can\xe2\x80\x99t. Uh, hey.\nLeonard: Where are we going?\nPenny: My limbic system wants to take your pants off.\nAlex: She seems nice.\nSheldon: Notice people on your own time. We\xe2\x80\x99re working.\nScene: Webcam conversation between Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s Office and the International Space Station\nBernadette: Hey, Howie, how you feeling?\nHoward: Better. Much better. The other astronauts held me down, gave me a shot. Oooh. Attention, people of Earth. Tonight, there will be two moons in the sky.\nBernadette: Howie, stop that. NASA\xe2\x80\x99s watching this! Put your pants back on!\nHoward: Whee! Whee!\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
