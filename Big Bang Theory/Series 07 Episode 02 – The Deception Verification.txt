b'Scene: The stairwell\nSheldon: And here\xe2\x80\x99s another interesting weather fact.\nPenny: Another? Great.\nSheldon: Changes in jet streams can affect the speed at which the Earth rotates on its axis, so bad weather can actually make the day longer.\nPenny: Well, there must be a hell of a storm somewhere.\nSheldon: Joke if you must, but you\xe2\x80\x99re going to miss these moments. With Leonard home in a few days, this was your last time driving me to the grocery store.\nPenny: You know, I will miss this.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what, if my apples are mealy, we\xe2\x80\x99ll hit the produce section for one last crazy blowout. Heck, you can even push the cart. Please don\xe2\x80\x99t take my looking forward to Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s return as criticism of the job you\xe2\x80\x99ve been doing in his absence.\nPenny: I won\xe2\x80\x99t.\nSheldon: That criticism will come later in your report card.\nPenny: Yeah, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t stay for the detention, I\xe2\x80\x99m not gonna read the report card.\nLeonard (in Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment): Hello.\nPenny (screams): Leonard! Hi!\nLeonard: Keep your voice down.\nPenny: Oh, my God. You weren\xe2\x80\x99t supposed to be here till Sunday.\nLeonard: We finished the experiment early, so I thought I\xe2\x80\x99d come home and surprise you.\nPenny: Oh, my gosh, why are we whispering?\nLeonard: I didn\xe2\x80\x99t tell Sheldon, so we could have a few days alone.\nPenny: Oh, that is so romantic.\nLeonard: Uh, sure, that\xe2\x80\x99s why I did it.\nPenny: Oh, I just cannot believe you\xe2\x80\x99re here.\nSheldon (off): Penny, it\xe2\x80\x99s your lucky day. Three of the eggs are clearly not jumbo. Grab your keys.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The comic book store.\nSheldon: Uh, Stuart, I was wondering if you could help me find something.\nStuart: Happy to, unless it\xe2\x80\x99s hope or a reason to live.\nSheldon: Oh, you make me laugh, sad clown. Anyhoo, Leonard will be back in a couple days and I need a welcome home gift for him. As he\xe2\x80\x99s been at sea, perhaps something with a nautical theme might be appropriate.\nStuart: Okay, well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how much you want to spend, but I do have this pretty cool Aquaman statue.\nSheldon: Aquaman? Oh, this isn\xe2\x80\x99t a gag gift, Stuart.\nStuart: Yeah, just as well. It\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty rare piece. I\xe2\x80\x99d rather just sell it to a real collector.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m a real collector. How rare is it?\nStuart: Oh, I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t even have mentioned it. How about a Batman squirt gun?\nSheldon: Don\xe2\x80\x99t try and trick me into buying something I don\xe2\x80\x99t want. Now let\xe2\x80\x99s talk Aquaman.\nHoward: What were they thinking, putting Doctor Octopus\xe2\x80\x99s mind in Spider-Man\xe2\x80\x99s body?\nRaj: Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been quite enjoying that. It combines all the superhero fun of Spider-Man with all the body-switching shenanigans of Freaky Friday. Both versions, original and Lohan.\nHoward: Both versions: original and Lohan. You\xe2\x80\x99re an idiot.\nRaj: Hey, what\xe2\x80\x99s your problem?\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been kind of snippy lately. It\xe2\x80\x99s probably this stupid diet I\xe2\x80\x99m on.\nRaj: Why are you on a diet?\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99ve put on a couple pounds. Had to buy these pants in the men\xe2\x80\x99s section.\nRaj: Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ve all seen your mom. That Butterball turkey was bound to come home to roost.\nSheldon: Twelve hundred dollars. That\xe2\x80\x99s my final offer.\nStuart: All right, Sheldon, you win. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure Leonard is gonna love this.\nSheldon: Oh, right, a present for Leonard. You better throw in that squirt gun.\nStuart: Ooh, yeah, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. This squirt gun, it\xe2\x80\x99s, uh, it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty rare.\nSheldon: Oh.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nLeonard: And this is me doing the Titanic pose on the boat.\nPenny: Ah.\nLeonard: And, oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s me getting rescued after I fell in.\nPenny: Oh. (Knock on door) Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s the pizza.\nLeonard: Yep. Here\xe2\x80\x99s some money.\nPenny: Thank you.\nLeonard: And I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna hit the head. That\xe2\x80\x99s what us salty sea dogs say when we have to go pee-pee.\nPenny: Hey.\nPizza guy: Twenty-two fifty.\nPenny: Okay, here\xe2\x80\x99s, uh, twenty-five. Keep the change.\nPizza guy: Seriously? I just walked up, like, four flights of stairs.\nPenny: Oh. Okay. Well, here\xe2\x80\x99s, um, thirty something cents and a promise I won\xe2\x80\x99t call your boss and tell him you reek of marijuana.\nSheldon: Oh, Penny, I see you\xe2\x80\x99ve ordered pizza. I have Chinese food.\nPenny: That\xe2\x80\x99s nice.\nSheldon: Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s a rather earthy cologne. My uncle used to wear that. Perhaps we can enjoy one last meal together before Leonard returns.\nPenny: Yeah, thanks, but I kind of feel like eating alone tonight, so\xe2\x80\xa6\nSheldon: Are you sure? With your Italian pizza and my Chinese noodles, we could play Marco Polo. I mean, of course, a re-enactment of a meal in the life of Marco Polo the Venetian explorer, not Marco Polo the terrifying water sport.\nPenny: Uh, yeah, it sounds fun, but no thanks. (Toilet flushes) Have a good night!\nSheldon: What, now, do you have company?\nPenny: No. No, no, no. You know what? The toilet\xe2\x80\x99s been doing that. I called the building manager, so\xe2\x80\xa6\nSheldon: Oh, I can take a look at it.\nPenny: Well\xe2\x80\xa6\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m quite familiar with plumbing. Not to brag, but I spent most of fifth grade with my head in a toilet.\nPenny: Yeah, no, no, no. You know what, Sheldon, it\xe2\x80\x99s okay. You don\xe2\x80\x99t have to go into the bathroom.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s curious. If there\xe2\x80\x99s no one here, why are there two glasses of wine on the table?\nPenny: Oh. Well, you know, I, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got two hands and a bit of a drinking problem.\nSheldon: Of course. Ask a silly question.\nPenny: Oh.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s odd.\nPenny: Um, what?\nSheldon: There are takeout containers in the trash can.\nPenny: So? That\xe2\x80\x99s my dinner from last night.\nSheldon: What\xe2\x80\x99s odd is they\xe2\x80\x99re in the trash can.\nPenny: Okay. Look, honey, I promise there\xe2\x80\x99s no one\xe2\x80\x99s here. I\xe2\x80\x98ve had a long day. I just want to have a quiet dinner by myself.\nSheldon: Oh, very well. I\xe2\x80\x99m no stranger to enjoying the pleasures of solitude. Oh!\nPenny: What?\nSheldon: Have you gotten Leonard a welcome-home gift yet?\nPenny: No.\nSheldon: Oh, great. Do you want to go halfsies on a two hundred dollar squirt gun?\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nBernadette: Hi, honey.\nHoward: Hey.\nBernadette: I made some brownies. You want one?\nHoward: You\xe2\x80\x99re kidding, right? I mean, you know I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to lose weight. God, I thought we were partners in this marriage.\nBernadette: We are. Stop it. And for the last time, you\xe2\x80\x99re not fat.\nHoward: Really? Tell that to the bathroom scale, \xe2\x80\x99cause one of you is lying.\nBernadette: Fine, forget I asked. How was dinner at your mom\xe2\x80\x99s?\nHoward: Awful. I had to rub her ointment all over her again.\nBernadette: Why can\xe2\x80\x99t she do it?\nHoward: \xe2\x80\x98Cause we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a deeply unhealthy relationship. Which reminds me, do you think you can get any samples of this from work? This was supposed to last her a month, but they didn\xe2\x80\x99t take into account the square footage of her back.\nBernadette: Let me see. How long have you been putting this on her?\nHoward: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Few weeks. Why?\nBernadette: This is really strong oestrogen cream. Please tell me you\xe2\x80\x99ve been wearing gloves.\nHoward: Like these swollen sausages could fit in gloves.\nBernadette: Howie, the oestrogen\xe2\x80\x99s getting absorbed by your skin. That\xe2\x80\x99s why you\xe2\x80\x99ve been all bloated and moody and a giant pain in the ass.\nHoward: You\xe2\x80\x99re full of oestrogen and you don\xe2\x80\x99t act like that.\nBernadette: That\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x99cause I\xe2\x80\x99m a woman. I\xe2\x80\x99ve had years of practice riding the dragon.\nHoward: Fine. I\xe2\x80\x99ll wear gloves next time.\nBernadette: It\xe2\x80\x99s still gonna take a few weeks for the hormones to leave your system.\nHoward: I feel so stupid. And fat.\nBernadette: It\xe2\x80\x99s okay. You still look great to me. In fact, why don\xe2\x80\x99t we go in the bedroom and I\xe2\x80\x99ll prove it to you?\nHoward: Sex? Really? I mean, that\xe2\x80\x99s just your solution to everything.\nScene: The apartment.\nAmy: Oh, and here\xe2\x80\x99s a fun thing. I worked it out so that there are two different words for spoon, planko and janko. Planko is a spoon with food, janko is a spoon without food. Janko is spelled with a silent ptang. Sheldon, you\xe2\x80\x99re not even listening to the rules of my made-up language.\nSheldon: Yes, I am.\nAmy: Then what does tweepadock mean?\nSheldon: Uh, elephant?\nAmy: Lucky guess.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. I\xe2\x80\x99m just distracted by something that happened over at Penny\xe2\x80\x99s.\nAmy: What happened?\nSheldon: I fear Penny is being unfaithful to Leonard.\nAmy: What?\nSheldon: She claimed to be alone when there was obviously someone else in her apartment. I have no choice but to assume the worst, given Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s lengthy sea voyage and her famously ravenous nether regions.\nAmy: I don\xe2\x80\x99t think Penny would cheat on Leonard.\nSheldon: Oh, really? She and I once had a staring contest. She clapped really loud and made me blink. It\xe2\x80\x99s a small leap from there to sexual infidelity.\nAmy: You\xe2\x80\x99re being ridiculous.\nSheldon: Amy, there were Chinese food containers in the trash can.\nAmy: Poor Leonard.\nScene: Sheldon and Amy listening at Penny\xe2\x80\x99s door.\nAmy: Do you hear anything?\nSheldon: I hear a woman\xe2\x80\x99s voice.\nAmy: Is it Penny?\nSheldon: No, it\xe2\x80\x99s you. All right, I hear whispering and giggling. Now I think I hear kissing.\nAmy: Yeah, like you know what kissing sounds like.\nSheldon: There\xe2\x80\x99s kissing in Star Trek, smarty-pants.\nAmy: Let me listen. Sounds like Leonard.\nSheldon: Please. Why would Leonard come home early and waste his time kissing Penny when he could be hanging out with his best buddy? Yeah, that\xe2\x80\x99s it. I\xe2\x80\x99m catching her in the act. (Unlocks door)\nAmy: No, Sheldon, don\xe2\x80\x99t.\nSheldon: Aha.\nPenny: What the hell?\nSheldon: Leonard?\nPenny: Sheldon, you cannot just barge in here like that.\nSheldon: Right. (Goes out.) (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. Are you going to answer the door or should I open it and say aha again?\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, Sheldon. I should\xe2\x80\x99ve told you I was back. I just wanted to have a couple days alone with Penny.\nSheldon: Oh, no, I should apologize. Uh, I never realized to what extent our friendship was a burden to you.\nLeonard: That is not fair. I complain about what a burden it is at least once a month.\nSheldon: Oh, no, no, let\xe2\x80\x99s not sugarcoat this. You find me finicky, pedantic and annoying.\nPenny: No, he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t.\nLeonard: I actually have used those exact words before. In that order.\nSheldon: Well, Leonard, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s high time you and I address the tweepadock in the room.\nLeonard: The what?\nSheldon: Amy?\nAmy: Please leave me out of this.\nSheldon: Fine. Leonard, there\xe2\x80\x99s no need for you to pretend to like me anymore.\nLeonard: Come on, I said I was sorry.\nSheldon: No, no, you save your apologies for after you\xe2\x80\x99ve had disappointing coitus with Penny.\nPenny: It was fine.\nLeonard: Come on, this is silly. Hey, um, I brought you back a little present from my trip, huh? It\xe2\x80\x99s that sailor cap that you wanted. It\xe2\x80\x99s neat, huh?\nSheldon: You honestly think you can buy back my friendship with a cheap souvenir?\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t. I really don\xe2\x80\x99t. Just try it on. Oh, yeah.\nAmy: Hello, sailor.\nPenny: Ooh, now we\xe2\x80\x99re talking.\nSheldon: Excuse me. This changes nothing. Except the Halloween costume I\xe2\x80\x99m wearing this year. Amy, you\xe2\x80\x99re going to be Olive Oyl. Lay off the doughnuts.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nHoward: Thanks for coming over.\nRaj: No problem. Ooh, you made little sandwiches.\nHoward: Yeah, that\xe2\x80\x99s cucumber and cream cheese. That\xe2\x80\x99s turkey and loganberry. And don\xe2\x80\x99t tell my hips, but I\xe2\x80\x99m warming up a brie in the oven.\nRaj: Nice. So, mmm. What\xe2\x80\x99s up?\nHoward: Okay, well, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been reading up on all the side effects you can get from oestrogen, and, I need you to be honest with me. Do my boobs look bigger to you?\nRaj: Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s kind of hard to tell.\nHoward: Come on, Raj, it\xe2\x80\x99s a yes or no question.\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure. Um, wait. Jump up and down, let\xe2\x80\x99s see if they jiggle. Uh, no, I, I still can\xe2\x80\x99t tell, uh, oh, you know what? Okay, uh, give me some of this.\nHoward: Seriously?\nRaj: Do you want my help or not?\nHoward: Fine.\nRaj: Okay, yup. See, see, that, that looks like, that looks like they could be bigger. But you know, I bet, I bet when I do it, mine do the same thing.\nHoward: Yeah, they kind of do.\nRaj: Hmm. Uh, let me see something. (Grabs his boob)\nHoward: Hey, easy, my nipples are sensitive.\nRaj: Oh. Sorry, sorry, uh, okay. (Grabs boob again. Behind them, Bernadette walks in) I mean, yeah, maybe.\nHoward: Okay, let me feel. No, I am definitely up a cup size.\nRaj: You know, but, but they\xe2\x80\x99re very firm, so you\xe2\x80\x99ve got that going for you.\nHoward: You think?\nRaj: Yeah, yeah, yeah, very perky.\nHoward: Thank you. I really needed to hear that today. (Bernadette rolls eyes and walks out) Ooh, brie\xe2\x80\x99s ready.\nRaj: Yay.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: Good morning.\nSheldon: Hello.\nLeonard: So am I driving you to work or are you still mad at me?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99d like a ride. Assuming you actually do take me to work.\nLeonard: Where do you think I would take you?\nSheldon: Who knows? Uh, you said you\xe2\x80\x99d be home yesterday, but you came home three days ago. You say you\xe2\x80\x99re taking me to work, but for all I know, I\xe2\x80\x99ll end up in a deserted amusement park. Or a cornfield maze. Or a back alley dog fight. You tell me.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m going to work. You can come if you want.\nSheldon: Okay. By the way, you have something on your shirt.\nLeonard: No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t.\nSheldon: Hurts, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it? You know, I find myself wondering if anything you\xe2\x80\x99ve ever told me is true.\nLeonard: I didn\xe2\x80\x99t make it back. The ship sank, I\xe2\x80\x99m in hell.\nSheldon: You say you\xe2\x80\x99re from New Jersey, but how can I believe you?\nLeonard: Why would anyone claim to be from New Jersey if they weren\xe2\x80\x99t?\nSheldon: All right, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you that one.\nLeonard: Hey, I said I was sorry. What else do you want from me?\nSheldon: I want you to admit that what you did was wrong.\nLeonard: Fine. What I did was wrong.\nSheldon: I wish I could believe you.\nLeonard: You know what? I\xe2\x80\x99m not driving you to work, because you\xe2\x80\x99re incredibly annoying.\nSheldon: You say one thing and do the other, so then you are driving me and you find me a delight.\nLeonard: Stop it.\nSheldon: Keep it up?\nLeonard: Bye.\nSheldon: Hello. So I guess you\xe2\x80\x99re really holding up the other four fingers?\nScene: The stairwell.\nPenny: Oh, hey, what are you doing here so early?\nAmy: Driving Sheldon to work.\nPenny: He\xe2\x80\x99s still mad at Leonard, huh?\nAmy: Well, he\xe2\x80\x99s mad at you, too. He says you\xe2\x80\x99re the succubus who led his friend astray.\nPenny: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what succubus is, but it has suck in it, so that can\xe2\x80\x99t be good.\nSheldon: Thought I heard you out here.\nPenny: Hey, Sheldon.\nSheldon: You don\xe2\x80\x99t get a hey. You get a hmm.\nPenny: Come on, don\xe2\x80\x99t be like that. We had so much fun together the last couple of months.\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re right. Which makes your betrayal all the more devastating.\nPenny: Sheldon.\nSheldon: I let you buy feminine hygiene products with my supermarket club card. You have any idea the kind of coupons I\xe2\x80\x99m going to get in the mail now?\nAmy: Sheldon, your fight\xe2\x80\x99s with Leonard. Penny\xe2\x80\x99s got nothing to do\xe2\x80\xa6\nSheldon: Careful, Amy. The friend of my enemy\xe2\x80\x99s girlfriend is my enemy.\nAmy: Really?\nSheldon: Yes. You\xe2\x80\x99re either with me or against me.\nAmy: You want to take the bus to work?\nSheldon: Maybe there\xe2\x80\x99s a third option.\nAmy: FYI, I had a doughnut for breakfast, you jerk.\nScene: The cafeteria.\nLeonard: So now we\xe2\x80\x99re just waiting for the data from the ship to be crunched, but the numbers look pretty promising.\nHoward: That\xe2\x80\x99s so great. If you guys prove the existence of Unruh radiation\xe2\x80\xa6 Hey, hey, hey, hey. My eyes are up here.\nSheldon: Howard, Raj. Judas.\nLeonard: You know what? You\xe2\x80\x99re a crazy person.\nSheldon: A crazy person with a long memory, and if all goes according to plan, a robot army.\nHoward: Stop it.\nSheldon: Or a mutant army. It depends on how my Kickstarter goes.\nHoward: I said, stop it. Now, listen to me. You two aren\xe2\x80\x99t just friends. You\xe2\x80\x99re best friends. And that\xe2\x80\x99s a beautiful thing. I mean, Leonard, you know why he\xe2\x80\x99s so mad at you? It\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x99cause he missed you. Yeah, and as his friend, you should be happy he has love in his life. As I do. This man held my breast the other day and I love him for it.\nRaj: A little loud, dude.\nHoward: So, can we please put aside these petty differences and just be glad we\xe2\x80\x99re here together?\nLeonard: Okay.\nSheldon: I suppose so.\nHoward: Thank you.\nRaj: Uh, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t anything weird. It was just to see how big they were.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: And then Leonard took me to the barber and the dentist, and then to cap off the perfect day, the Los Angeles Bureau of Weights and Measures.\nLeonard: I thought the measures were going to be the stars of the show, turns out it was the weights.\nPenny: I\xe2\x80\x99m so glad you guys are friends again.\nSheldon: And I\xe2\x80\x99m glad you and I are friends again, too.\nPenny: Aw.\nSheldon: Which reminds me. This came in the mail, and I want you to have it.\nPenny: Fifty cents off Vagisil.\nSheldon: Think of me when you apply it.\nRaj: Uh, can I just say, I\xe2\x80\x99ve missed all of us hanging out together.\nSheldon: Yeah.\nPenny: Me, too.\n  Leonard: Um, since when can Koothrappali talk in front of the girls without a beer?\n  Bernadette: Oh, that happened right after you left.\n  Leonard: And no one told me?\n  Howard (crying): Can\xe2\x80\x99t believe we forgot to tell him.\n  Penny (handing Howard the Vagisil coupon): Think of Sheldon when you apply it.\n  Advertisements\nLoading...'
