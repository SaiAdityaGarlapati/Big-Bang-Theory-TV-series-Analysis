b'Scene: The apartment.\nSheldon: The entrance to the dungeon is a moss covered door. You manage to open it only to find yourself face-to-face with a hideous, foul-smelling, moss-covered ogre. What do you do?\nHoward: I say, hey Ma, what\xe2\x80\x99s for dinner?\xe2\x80\x9d\nSheldon: Seventeen. The ogre is amused by your joke and allows you to pass. By the by, I liked it, too.\nLeonard: Hey, how go the wedding plans, Howard?\nHoward: Great. We spent five hours last night at Macy\xe2\x80\x99s registering for gifts. Looks like I\xe2\x80\x99m finally going to have that darling little earthenware asparagus dish I\xe2\x80\x99ve always wanted.\nLeonard: See, this is the good thing about having a girlfriend 9,000 miles away. I can spend my nights doing whatever I want.\nHoward: You mean like playing nerd games with us and then taking a suspiciously long shower?\nLeonard: Maybe. We enter the dungeon.\nSheldon: You see a dragon.\nHoward: Really? So we\xe2\x80\x99re playing Dungeons and Dragons, and we walk into a dungeon and see a dragon? Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that a little on the nose?\nSheldon: When you play Chutes and Ladders, do you complain about all the chutes and all the ladders?\nLeonard: Are you gonna eat that whole pie?\nRaj: Maybe. Why not? Who do I have in my life to watch my figure for?\nLeonard: Oh, God, did you watch Bridget Jones again?\nRaj: No, it\xe2\x80\x99s just that everybody\xe2\x80\x99s got someone. Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s with Amy, Howard\xe2\x80\x99s getting married, you\xe2\x80\x99re dating my sister.\nLeonard: Now that Howard\xe2\x80\x99s getting married, maybe he\xe2\x80\x99ll inflate one of his old girlfriends for you.\nRaj: You know who I blame for my loneliness? The United States of America. Your movies and your TV shows promised streets paved with beautiful blonde women with big bazongas.\nHoward: Eat another pie, you\xe2\x80\x99ll have your own bazongas.\nRaj: That\xe2\x80\x99s cruel. You know it goes straight to my hips.\nSheldon: Gentlemen, please focus. You\xe2\x80\x99re facing a fire-breathing dragon.\nRaj: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if I want to play anymore.\nSheldon: Because you don\xe2\x80\x99t have a girlfriend? Well, good Lord, if that becomes a reason not to play Dungeons and Dragons, this game\xe2\x80\x99s in serious trouble.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nAmy: Now, I assume we use this same wax later on to neaten up each other\xe2\x80\x99s bikini regions.\nPenny: Yeah, my bikini region is fine.\nAmy: Who\xe2\x80\x99s shocked? I\xe2\x80\x99m not. So, Bernadette, how\xe2\x80\x99s the wedding planning going? And I\xe2\x80\x99m not asking as a prospective bridesmaid. Pick me! Pick me!\nBernadette: We went cake-tasting yesterday. Raj came along. He cried and ate half the samples.\nPenny: Oh, the poor guy\xe2\x80\x99s so lonely. We should set him up with someone.\nBernadette: You know, I met a really cute girl at work. She\xe2\x80\x99s married to a guy in one of our drug trials.\nPenny: Well, hello? She\xe2\x80\x99s married.\nBernadette: Yeah, but her husband is in serious congestive heart failure, and a little birdie told me he\xe2\x80\x99s in the placebo group.\nPenny: Okay, so future grief-stricken widow is the one to beat.\nScene: The Cheesecake Factory.\nLeonard: Are we ready to order?\nSheldon: One moment. I\xe2\x80\x99m conducting an experiment.\nHoward: With Dungeons and Dragons dice?\nSheldon: Yes. From here on in, I\xe2\x80\x99ve decided to make all trivial decisions with a throw of the dice, thus freeing up my mind to do what it does best, enlighten and amaze. Page 14, item seven.\nHoward: So, what\xe2\x80\x99s for dinner?\nSheldon: A side of corn succotash. Hmm. Interesting.\nPenny: Um, Howard, can I see you for a minute, please?\nHoward: Uh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to show any more of your friends how I can fit in the booster seats.\nPenny: Uh, no, that\xe2\x80\x99s not it. Just come with me, please.\nSheldon: Let\xe2\x80\x99s see what I\xe2\x80\x99ll be washing that succotash down with. A pitcher of margaritas.\nLeonard: Do you really want that?\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s the great thing. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter. My mind is freed up to think about more important things.\nRaj: What\xe2\x80\x99s it thinking about now?\nSheldon: Hamburgers and lemonade.\nPenny: Um, Raj, there\xe2\x80\x99s someone I want you to meet. This is my friend Emily. I know her from my spin class. Raj, relax. She can\xe2\x80\x99t hear you. She\xe2\x80\x99s deaf.\nHoward (signing): Emily, this is our friend Raj.\nPenny: Oh! Look at you guys just hitting it off. I am so good.\nRaj: Hi.\nHoward: She says it\xe2\x80\x99s nice to meet you.\nRaj: Does she really mean that or was she signing it sarcastically?\nHoward: Raj says it\xe2\x80\x99s nice to meet you, too. She says she has to go back to her family, but Penny has her number if you want to text her and get together.\nRaj: Okay, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to play it cool. Tell her, maybe. Whatever, babe.\nHoward: He\xe2\x80\x99ll text you.\nRaj: Ah, look at that. I have a date. I love America again.\nSheldon: And now for dessert, come on, hot fudge sundae, come on, hot fudge sundae. Bam! That\xe2\x80\x99s what I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about!\nScene: A coffee shop.\nRaj: Okay, as soon as she gets here, so she knows I\xe2\x80\x99m cool with it, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to make a joke about her being deaf. I was thinking, hey, did you hear the one about\xe2\x80\xa6? Oh, no, I bet you didn\xe2\x80\x99t.\nHoward: Maybe we should revisit your lonely fat guy plan.\nRaj: Oh, she\xe2\x80\x99s here.\nHoward: No joke. Oh, she says she\xe2\x80\x99s sorry she\xe2\x80\x99s late.\nRaj: Tell her it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter. Tell her, her eyes shimmer like opalescent lilies in the lake of the palace of the celestial maidens.\nHoward: Really? That\xe2\x80\x99s the first thing you want to say?\nRaj: I worked on it all night. Use it.\nHoward: Look, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the sign for opalescent.\nRaj: Then spell it.\nHoward: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how to spell it.\nRaj: You\xe2\x80\x99re blowing this for me!\nHoward: He likes your eyes.\nRaj: You\xe2\x80\x99re making me sound like a caveman.\nHoward: She says, thank you, you have nice eyes, too.\xe2\x80\x9d\nRaj: Really? Ask her how many children she wants, and whatever number she says, say, me too.\nHoward: No.\nRaj: Fine. Tell her I have a deep, sexy voice like James Earl Jones.\nHoward: She doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know what James Earl Jones sounds like.\nRaj: Great. Then she won\xe2\x80\x99t know I\xe2\x80\x99m lying.\nScene: The same, later.\nRaj: Let\xe2\x80\x99s see, what else can I tell you about me that would make you like me? Ooh, I love music. Do you love music?\nHoward: You really want to ask her that?\nRaj: You\xe2\x80\x99re right. Everyone loves music.\nHoward: She says, do you play an instrument?\nRaj: No, but when I was six years old, I tried to start a boy band called Frankie Goes to Bollywood. But I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get any other boys to join, so my parents asked the servants to be my backup dancers. Wait, when you sign servants, don\xe2\x80\x99t sign it like I\xe2\x80\x99m bragging. Sign it in a way that I sound humble with just a hint of, that\xe2\x80\x99s right, I had servants.\nHoward: Do you hear yourself\nRaj: Yes, but she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t. So get signing, hand monkey.\nScene: The same, later.\nHoward (translating for Emily): I think I wrote a letter to Santa Claus every day. And then on Christmas morning, under the tree is a little puppy with a red ribbon.\nRaj: What are you doing?\nHoward: Texting Bernadette that I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna be late.\nRaj: Dude, what is she saying?\nHoward: It\xe2\x80\x99s a funny story about a puppy. Just smile and laugh. Quick, quick, stop smiling.\nRaj: What? Why?\nHoward: The puppy died, it choked on a doll head. Sad face, sad face!\nScene: Outside the coffee shop.\nRaj: It\xe2\x80\x99s a little hard to see with the city lights, but that W-shaped constellation is Cassiopeia. And she was the mother of Andromeda who\xe2\x80\x99s over there.\nHoward: Look, pretty stars. This is her car. She hopes she can see you again sometime.\nRaj: Good, good. Oh, boy, help me out here. Does she want me to kiss her or not?\nHoward: I speak sign language, I don\xe2\x80\x99t read minds.\nRaj: If you were me, would you kiss her?\nHoward: Yeah, but I\xe2\x80\x99m a make out king. (She kisses Raj and gets into car)\nRaj: I was so smooth on that date.\nHoward: You? I made you smooth. You were an idiot.\nRaj: Whatever, dude. She kissed me.\nHoward: It might\xe2\x80\x99ve been on your lips, but it was my kiss.\nRaj: Oh, fine. Let\xe2\x80\x99s agree she kissed both of us.\nHoward: Okay.\nScene: The apartment.\nPenny: Mustache is looking good there, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Don\xe2\x80\x99t thank me. Thank the dice. They told me what percentage of my face to shave.\nHoward: Why are you still doing this?\nSheldon: Because it\xe2\x80\x99s working. In the past few weeks, unburdened by trivial decisions, I\xe2\x80\x99ve co-authored two papers in notable peer-reviewed journals, and I\xe2\x80\x99m close to figuring out why the Large Hadron Collider has yet to isolate the Higgs boson particle.\nLeonard: You left out, got chafed testicles because you no longer wear underpants.\nSheldon: The dice giveth and the dice taketh away.\nPenny: Is Raj out with Emily again?\nLeonard: Yeah, every night for the last month.\nPenny: Wow, can\xe2\x80\x99t believe he has a girlfriend.\nSheldon (rolls dice): Me neither.\nHoward: Here\xe2\x80\x99s some other fun news on the Raj/Emily front. He gave her a pair of diamond earrings and leased her a car.\nPenny: You\xe2\x80\x99re kidding.\nLeonard: You think she\xe2\x80\x99s taking advantage of him?\nPenny: Oh, of course not. She wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do something like that. She\xe2\x80\x99s deaf.\nLeonard: Deaf women can\xe2\x80\x99t be gold diggers?\nPenny: Handicapped people are nice, Leonard. Everyone knows that.\nSheldon: Yeah, I actually have information about Raj that would be helpful with this discussion.\nLeonard: Could you tell us?\nSheldon: Let\xe2\x80\x99s see. (Rolls dice) Snake eyes. Sorry, bud.\nPenny: Wait, hang on. Doubles. Roll again.\nSheldon: Okay, get this. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter if he\xe2\x80\x99s showering her with gifts, because the Koothrappalis are vastly wealthy.\nPenny: What do you mean, vastly wealthy?\nSheldon: Well, wealthy means a lot of money, and vastly means even more. I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure what\xe2\x80\x99s tripping you up.\nLeonard: Look, I know they have money. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s that much.\nSheldon: No, you\xe2\x80\x99re wrong. See, as you know, a few years ago, I achieved one of my lesser dreams and became a notary public. Well, from time to time, I notarize banking documents for Raj. The Koothrappalis aren\xe2\x80\x99t just rich, they\xe2\x80\x99re Richie Rich rich.\nPenny: Well, so how much is that?\nSheldon: About halfway between Bruce Wayne and Scrooge McDuck.\nHoward: What the hell? The last time we went to the zoo, that son of a bitch made me buy him a churro.\nLeonard: Listen, guys, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to be rude, but I need to go call Raj\xe2\x80\x99s sister, who I love so much. So vastly much.\nPenny: Okay, so he\xe2\x80\x99s got money, and it\xe2\x80\x99s a few gifts and a car.\nHoward: And she got him to pay off all her credit cards.\nPenny: What? He paid off her credit cards? Damn it, I could\xe2\x80\x99ve dated Raj for a couple months. But I, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have, because I\xe2\x80\x99m not that kind of girl. We should really talk to Raj.\nHoward: He\xe2\x80\x99s not going to listen, he\xe2\x80\x99s in love.\nSheldon: Can\xe2\x80\x99t figure out what to do? I remember those days. Now, if you\xe2\x80\x99ll excuse me, I have to\xe2\x80\xa6 (rolls dice) stay right here.\nScene: The gym.\nHoward: Yeah, this is a bad idea. We should go.\nPenny: No. I\xe2\x80\x99m the one that introduced him to her. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to say something.\nHoward: Wow.\nPenny: You\xe2\x80\x99re engaged to my friend.\nHoward: Hey, Bernadette doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mind where I get my motor running, as long as I park in the right garage.\nPenny: I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe you\xe2\x80\x99re engaged to my friend. Oh, here she comes.\nHoward: Smart. Whisper so the deaf chick can\xe2\x80\x99t hear you.\nPenny: Hi.\nHoward (translating): Oh, hey, hi. Nice to see you.\nPenny: Um, can we talk to you about Raj?\nHoward: She says, sure, what about him?\nPenny: Okay, um, gosh, how do I start? Um, see, Raj is kind of naive. I mean, he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t dated a whole lot of women. And I\xe2\x80\x99m concerned that, without meaning to, you might be taking advantage of him. You know, by letting him buy you a bunch of expensive things.And I.. I\xe2\x80\xa6 Howard, focus. Tell her what I\xe2\x80\x99m saying.\nHoward: Right. Are you a gold digger or not? Oh, uh, something, something, who the something do you think you are? Mind your own something business and go something yourself. Oh, wait, I got this now.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment. She answers the door.\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99m so mad at you!\nPenny: Okay, wait\xe2\x80\xa6\nRaj: How dare you ambush my girlfriend at the gym!\nPenny: We didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean for it to be an ambush. Just, it\xe2\x80\x99s kind of impossible not to sneak up on deaf people. And hey, since when are you so chatty?\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99m hammered.\nPenny: Raj, come here. This girl is trouble. I mean, what kind of relationship is it where you buy her gifts and she gives you sex?\nRaj: The best one I ever had!\nPenny: Okay, come on. You know you can do better.\nRaj: Aha. I see what\xe2\x80\x99s going on here. You and I had our crazy night together, and now you can\xe2\x80\x99t stand to see me with another woman.\nPenny: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!\nRaj: It\xe2\x80\x99s okay. I can\xe2\x80\x99t get mad at your feelings.\nPenny: I don\xe2\x80\x99t have feelings.\nRaj: Yeah, that\xe2\x80\x99s good. Keep telling yourself that. (Storms out)\nPenny: He is cuter now that I know he\xe2\x80\x99s rich.\nScene: Raj\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nRaj: I have a surprise for you. Cover your eyes. Open them. It\xe2\x80\x99s a real ruby. It was a little expensive, but no one can put a price on love. Although, the people at Cartier took a pretty good shot at it. (Skype tone from computer) Oh, Mummy, Daddy. What a nice surprise.\nDr Koothrappali: No, it\xe2\x80\x99s not a nice surprise, it\xe2\x80\x99s a bad surprise.\nMrs Koothrappali: Penny called us.\nRaj: Penny?\nMrs Koothrappali: She told us you\xe2\x80\x99re spending all our money on your new girlfriend.\nRaj: I just got her a couple of things. She gives me things, too.\nDr Koothrappali: Yeah, yeah, I\xe2\x80\x99m a gynaecologist. I know exactly what she gives you.\nMrs Koothrappali: You need to find a nice Indian girl from a good family. If you keep seeing this woman, you\xe2\x80\x99re cut off.\nRaj: What? You\xe2\x80\x99re going to make me choose between the woman I love and the money I have very strong feelings for?\nDr Koothrappali: It\xe2\x80\x99s up to you.\nRaj: Well, I choose love.\nDr Koothrappali: Hah. You\xe2\x80\x99re an idiot. Love doesn\xe2\x80\x99t last. Well, he\xe2\x80\x99s going to find out eventually. Think about it.\nRaj: My parents are making me choose between money and you. I choose you. (She signs) No, I think we\xe2\x80\x99ll have to return the car. (Again) And that necklace, yeah, that, too. But none of those things matter, because we have something better. We have love.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nRaj: Oh, Penny, I hurt so bad.\nPenny: I know, I know.\nRaj: Sometimes I put the TV on mute just to pretend she\xe2\x80\x99s still with me. But I can\xe2\x80\x99t watch the closed captioning without crying.\nPenny: Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m so sorry. I wish I could make you feel better.\nRaj: Seriously? I\xe2\x80\x99m heartbroken and you\xe2\x80\x99re hitting on me?\nPenny: What? No!\nRaj: Look, Penny, you\xe2\x80\x99re great, but I had a long talk with my parents, and they said if I date an Indian girl, I get a Maserati.\nScene: The Cheesecake Factory.\nRaj: Mmm. Oh, cheesecake, you\xe2\x80\x99re just as good as a woman, even though I can\xe2\x80\x99t have sex with you.\nHoward: Try throwing it in the microwave for a few seconds.\nSheldon: Should I use the rest room or wait until we get home? Come on, papa needs to void his bladder. Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s not what you want to see after three buttermilks.\nPenny: Here you go, boys. I\xe2\x80\x99ll pick it up when you\xe2\x80\x99re ready.\nHoward: Thanks for dinner, buddy.\nLeonard: Yeah, real big of you.\nSheldon: Hurry, hurry, hurry.\nPenny: Oh, and don\xe2\x80\x99t cheap out on the tip. We all know you\xe2\x80\x99re loaded now.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
