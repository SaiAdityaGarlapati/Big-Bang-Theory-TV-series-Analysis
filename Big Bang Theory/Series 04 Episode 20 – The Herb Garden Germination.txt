b'Scene: A bookstore.\nDr. Brian Greene: My new book, The Hidden Reality, takes on a grand question. Is our universe the only universe? You see, there\xe2\x80\x99s a growing belief among scientists like me that ours may only be one among many universes populating a gigantic cosmos. In The Hidden Reality, I explore this possibility without presuming any knowledge of mathematics or physics on the part of the reader.\nSheldon: Hysterical.\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99m glad you talked me into this. We work so hard, sometimes, it\xe2\x80\x99s nice to goof off and do something silly.\nSheldon: Agreed. Wait till you hear how he dumbs down Werner Heisenberg for the crowd. You may actually believe you\xe2\x80\x99re in a comedy club.\nGreene: You can think about Heisenberg\xe2\x80\x99s Uncertainty Principle much like the special order menu that you find in certain Chinese restaurants, where you have dishes in column A and other dishes in column B, and if you order the first dish in column A, you can\xe2\x80\x99t order the corresponding dish in column B. That\xe2\x80\x99s sort of like the Uncertainly Principle.\nSheldon: Ba-dum-bump.\nAmy: Say, I heard an interesting tidbit about Howard and Bernadette.\nSheldon: Really, Amy? Gossip? I\xe2\x80\x99m disappointed in you.\nAmy: Now, now. Evolutionary biologist Robin Dunbar has identified gossip as an aid to social bonding in large groups.\nSheldon: Forgive my language, but poppycock.\nAmy: What if he\xe2\x80\x99s right? And by not participating in gossip, society breaks down into small feral bands of tattooed motorcycle riders fighting to the death over the last few cans of tuna fish?\nSheldon: Fine. In the parlance of the urban music scene, what\xe2\x80\x99s the 4-1-1?\nAmy: Bernadette is thinking about breaking up with Howard.\nSheldon: I believe our nation\xe2\x80\x99s tuna cans are safe. Excuse me. Dr. Greene, question?\nGreene: Yes?\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99ve dedicated your life\xe2\x80\x99s work to educating the general populace about complex scientific ideas.\nGreene: Yes, in part.\nSheldon: Have you ever considered trying to do something useful? Perhaps, reading to the elderly?\nGreene: Excuse me?\nSheldon: Yeah, but not your books. Something they might enjoy. I kid, of course. Big fan.\nCredits sequence\nScene: The apartment. The guys are playing on a Nintendo Wii.\nLeonard: Nice shot.\nSheldon: Thank you. My father taught me archery as a child. It\xe2\x80\x99s odd how the activity brings back the smell of Kmart bourbon.\nLeonard: Perfect.\nSheldon: I know. What an elf I would have made. Whoo, what do you think you\xe2\x80\x99re doing?\nLeonard: Shooting at a target?\nSheldon: With what?\nLeonard: An arrow.\nSheldon: Really? I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see you draw one from your quiver.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to do that, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Leonard, the people at Nintendo can only go so far in helping us recreate an actual athletic experience. We have to do our part, too. (Leonard mimes drawing an arrow and stabbing Sheldon with it.) That was uncalled for, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll play along. Ow! I had an unusual experience with Amy last night.\nLeonard: Really? How could you tell?\nSheldon: She was attempting to engage me in gossip.\nLeonard: You don\xe2\x80\x99t say?\nSheldon: Yes. I think prolonged exposure to Penny has turned her into a bit of a Gabby Gertie.\nLeonard: So, what\xe2\x80\x99s the gossip?\nSheldon: Oh, please, I was just pointing it out. I have no desire to engage in the activity.\nLeonard: Fine, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell me.\nSheldon: All right, get this. Bernadette is thinking about breaking up with Howard.\nLeonard: Oh. That\xe2\x80\x99s too bad. I wonder what happened.\nSheldon: Mm, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to say. I can only speculate based on the data I collected watching my parents\xe2\x80\x99 marriage implode. In that case, the woman dives into religion, while the man dives into a bottle-blonde bartender who tries to buy my love with action figures. Oop! Out of arrows.\nLeonard: Boy, you sure get your money\xe2\x80\x99s worth out of these games.\nScene: The bathroom.\nLeonard: \xe2\x80\x93 Priya, can I come in?\nPriya: Sure.\nLeonard: Oh, God.\nPriya: What?\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s okay. You didn\xe2\x80\x99t know. I\xe2\x80\x99ll take care of it.\nPriya: What, what did I do?\nLeonard: Sheldon doesn\xe2\x80\x99t allow flossing that close to the mirror.\nPriya: You\xe2\x80\x99re kidding.\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s a splatter thing. There\xe2\x80\x99s a little piece of tape on the floor you\xe2\x80\x99re supposed to stand behind.\nPriya: That\xe2\x80\x99s madness.\nLeonard: I know. Just do it. There\xe2\x80\x99s a big inspection coming up, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to lose my TV privileges.\nPriya: You really need to let me take a look at that roommate agreement one of these days.\nLeonard: Mm, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I get a lawyer, he gets a lawyer, it\xe2\x80\x99s just easier to stand behind the tape.\nPriya: Oh, by the way, a fellow at work said I could use his Dodger tickets this weekend. Does that sound like fun?\nLeonard: Yeah! Dodgers are baseball, right?\nPriya: You\xe2\x80\x99ll need to explain the game to me.\nLeonard: Mm, it\xe2\x80\x99s complicated, but as I remember it, the essentials are, get chosen last, get hit by the ball, cry, go home.\nPriya: Well, regardless, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got four tickets, and I was thinking we can bring Bernadette and Howard. She\xe2\x80\x99s really interesting, and I bet I can get used to him.\nLeonard: Well, it might not be a great idea to invite those two.\nPriya: Why not?\nLeonard: Don\xe2\x80\x99t tell anybody I told you, but I heard she might be breaking up with him.\nPriya: Oh, too bad. Although I do know one person for whom that\xe2\x80\x99s good news.\nLeonard: Really? Who?\nPriya: My brother. He\xe2\x80\x99s got a big crush on Bernadette.\nLeonard: What? You\xe2\x80\x99re kidding!\nPriya: Mmm. I found poems he wrote about her. Very disturbing. Oh, Bernadette, please play my clarinet.\nLeonard: Wow, that\xe2\x80\x99s hard to believe.\nPriya: Yes. And for years, everyone in my family was convinced that he was the clarinet enthusiast. Hmm. What\xe2\x80\x99s that piece of tape?\nLeonard: Oh, that one doesn\xe2\x80\x99t apply to you. You sit.\nScene: The lobby.\nLeonard: Hey!\nPenny: Hey! How\xe2\x80\x99s it going?\nLeonard: Not too bad. Did you hear about Howard and Bernadette?\nPenny: \xe2\x80\x98Course I heard about it. How did you hear about it?\nLeonard: I heard about it from Sheldon. He got it from Amy.\nPenny: Oh, damn it. I told Amy that in the strictest confidence. Boy, some people are such blabbermouths. Well, whatever, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure Bernadette can do better.\nLeonard: Do you think a sexually ambivalent Indian astrophysicist with selective mutism and alcohol issues is better than a hundred-pound Jewish guy who lives with his mom?\nPenny: You are kidding. Raj likes Bernadette?\nLeonard: I didn\xe2\x80\x99t say Raj. Who said Raj?\nPenny: Okay, give. How do you know? Did he tell you?\nLeonard: No.\nPenny: Well, then who?\nLeonard: I can\xe2\x80\x99t say.\nPenny: Priya told you. What a little gossip. You know, not an attractive quality in a woman, Leonard. Not judging, just my opinion.\nLeonard: Well, The point is, if this got out, it would destroy Howard and Raj\xe2\x80\x99s friendship.\nPenny: You don\xe2\x80\x99t have to worry. Unlike Amy and Priya, I know how to keep a secret.\nLeonard: You\xe2\x80\x99re the one who told Amy in the first place.\nPenny: In confidence!\nScene: Raj\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nRaj: Hello, Mummy. Hello, Daddy. How are you?\nMrs Koothrappali (on webcam): We\xe2\x80\x99re very rich in a very poor country. So, all in all, can\xe2\x80\x99t complain.\nDr Koothrappali: So, Priya, how are enjoying staying with your brother?\nPriya: It\xe2\x80\x99s fine. But if I\xe2\x80\x99m going to stay in Los Angeles much longer, I think I should get my own place.\nMrs Koothrappali: Why? Is Rajesh not making you feel comfortable? Rajesh, why aren\xe2\x80\x99t you making your sister comfortable?\nRaj: I am making her comfortable. Besides, she\xe2\x80\x99s not sleeping here half the time anyway.\nDr Koothrappali: What? Where are you sleeping, Priya?\nPriya: It\xe2\x80\x99s a figure of speech, Daddy. It means I-I work late.\nMrs Koothrappali: Please tell me you\xe2\x80\x99re not dating an American. I knew this would happen. Rajesh, are you letting your sister date that little Howard boy?\nDr Koothrappali: Now, hold on. If she is dating an American, that\xe2\x80\x99s not a bad way to go. He\xe2\x80\x99s Jewish. Those chaps are very successful, and they don\xe2\x80\x99t drink a lot.\nRaj: It, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter. Howard has a girlfriend.\nPriya: For now.\nRaj: What does that mean?\nPriya: I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you later.\nRaj: Is something going on with him and Bernadette?\nMrs Koothrappali: Who\xe2\x80\x99s Bernadette?\nDr Koothrappali: Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t sound Jewish.\nMrs Koothrappali: You can\xe2\x80\x99t tell by that. Winona Ryder is Jewish.\nDr Koothrappali: Okay, we\xe2\x80\x99re getting off the subject. Rajesh, I want you to try harder to make your sister feel welcome.\nPriya: Thank you, Daddy.\nRaj: Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry. Everything I have, I share with her. Including my friend Leon\xe2\x80\xa6\nPriya: Good night, Mummy. Good night, Daddy.\nRaj: Oh, my God, I think you broke my toe!\nPriya: Well you should have kept your mouth shut.\nRaj: Fair enough. Now, what\xe2\x80\x99s up with Clarinet? Bernadette!\nScene: The cafeteria.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99ve been thinking about Dr. Greene\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to make science palatable for the masses.\nLeonard: Oh, yeah? What about it?\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s all. I\xe2\x80\x99ve just been thinking about it. Now, I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking about fractal equations. Now I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking about the origin of the phrase train of thought. Now I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking about trains.\nRaj: Are you listening to this guy?\nHoward: Hmm? Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. I was somewhere else.\nLeonard: Lucky bastard.\nSheldon: Now I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking about Jell-O.\nRaj: So what\xe2\x80\x99s up?\nHoward: It\xe2\x80\x99s a Bernadette thing.\nRaj: Oh, no. I hope everything\xe2\x80\x99s okay.\nLeonard: Whatever it is, we\xe2\x80\x99re here for you. You can tell us anything.\nRaj: Yeah. Good or devastating.\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna ask her to marry me.\nLeonard: Marry you?\nRaj: What?\nHoward: Yeah. I just need to figure out the right time to pop the question.\nLeonard: Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99d wait.\nRaj: No rush, no rush.\nHoward (phone rings): Oh, great. It\xe2\x80\x99s my cousin David about the ring. Hey, David, what\xe2\x80\x99d you find? Oh, sure, a half a carat\xe2\x80\x99s fine. Her freakishly small hands make anything look big. It\xe2\x80\x99s one of the reasons I love her.\nLeonard: Man, he\xe2\x80\x99s going to be blindsided.\nRaj: I know. It\xe2\x80\x99ll be awful.\nSheldon: Why are you smiling?\nLeonard: Yeah, Raj, why?\nRaj: Uh, a smile means something different in my country. You know, tears of joy, smile of sadness. India\xe2\x80\x99s a goofy place.\nSheldon: Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m back to trains. Woo-woo.\nScene: The apartment.\nAmy: Did I tell you our lab got a grant to study addiction?\nSheldon: No.\nAmy: Fascinating work. I recently trained a capuchin monkey to smoke cigarettes.\nSheldon: Have you learned anything?\nAmy: Yes. He looks much cooler than the non-smoking monkeys. Although it\xe2\x80\x99s not much of a contest. The other monkeys just sit around and masturbate.\nSheldon: If you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to stop listening to you and start talking.\nAmy: By all means.\nSheldon: Howard has announced his intention to propose marriage to Bernadette.\nAmy: I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand. The original piece of gossip indicated an impending breakup.\nSheldon: I know. The group consensus is that his proposal will be met with an humiliating, soul-crushing rejection. Everyone was set a-twitter. Although oddly, no one tweeted.\nAmy: It\xe2\x80\x99s not surprising that the story has captured the attention of our little circle of friends. Are you familiar with meme theory?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m familiar with everything, but go on.\nAmy: Meme theory suggests that items of gossip are like living things that seek to reproduce using humans as their host.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m no stranger to memetic epidemiology. At Johnson Elementary School, the phrase Shelly Cooper\xe2\x80\x99s a smelly pooper spread like wildfire.\nAmy: I should think so. That\xe2\x80\x99s gold.\nSheldon: Your meme hypothesis does intrigue me. How might we examine this more closely?\nAmy: Do you have any ethical qualms regarding human experimentation?\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s one of the few forms of interaction with people that I don\xe2\x80\x99t find repellent.\nAmy: We need to fabricate a tantalizing piece of gossip.\nSheldon: And a second non-tantalizing piece to use as a control.\nAmy: Then we\xe2\x80\x99ll track its progress through our social group and interpret the results through the competing academic prisms of memetic theory, algebraic gossip and epidemiology.\nSheldon: Look at you, getting me to engage in the social sciences. You\xe2\x80\x99re a vixen, Amy Farrah Fowler.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s door.\nPenny: Oh, hey, Amy. What\xe2\x80\x99s up?\nAmy: Sheldon and I engaged in sexual intercourse. In other news, I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking of starting an herb garden. Mum\xe2\x80\x99s the word. Gotta go.\nScene: The Cheesecake Factory\nBernadette: Oh, hey, Raj, what are you doing here?\nRaj: I just felt like drinking alone, because I\xe2\x80\x99m deep and dark.\nBernadette: Uh-huh. So, uh, Howard\xe2\x80\x99s not here?\nRaj: No. It\xe2\x80\x99s just one of those times when it\xe2\x80\x99s just you and me. Like when the three of us went to the movies and you and I waited outside the bathroom while Howard threw up Red Vines and Cherry Coke. Do you remember that?\nBernadette: Yeah.\nRaj: Me, too. Good times.\nPenny: Hey, 16 wants to order appetizers.\nBernadette: Oh, thanks.\nRaj: This was nice.\nPenny: What the hell are you doing? Howard is your best friend, and that is his girlfriend. You should be ashamed of yourself.\nRaj: I was when I came in, but it\xe2\x80\x99s amazing what liquor does to guilt. Besides what you might not know is, Bernadette is planning on breaking up with Howard.\nPenny: Well, I know that. How do you know that?\nRaj: My sister told me.\nPenny: Oh, that gossipy bitch! No offense.\nRaj: None taken. You should hear how she talks about you.\nPenny: Okay, listen, just because Howard and Bernadette are having problems, does not mean you should be here sniffing around.\nRaj: What can I do? I can\xe2\x80\x99t stop thinking about her.\nPenny: All right, try thinking about this. Sheldon and Amy had sex.\nRaj: Shut your ass!\nPenny: Yeah, it\xe2\x80\x99s true. Amy told me.\nRaj: How did that even happen? Did they know that\xe2\x80\x99s what they were doing when they were doing it?\nPenny: I-I guess they just figured it out at some point.\nRaj: Wow. I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe old Smelly Pooper finally got laid.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: Hey.\nSheldon: Hey.\nLeonard: Hope you\xe2\x80\x99re hungry.\nSheldon: Interesting. A friendly sentiment in this country, cruel taunt in the Sudan. It\xe2\x80\x99s a lesson in context.\nLeonard: Will Amy be joining us for dinner?\nSheldon: Yes, I believe so.\nLeonard: Good, good. Everything okay between you two?\nSheldon: Yes. Why do you ask?\nLeonard: No reason. I was just talking to Raj, and he mentioned what a lovely glow she has these days.\nSheldon: Did he mean as if she\xe2\x80\x99d been out in the sun, tending an herb garden without wearing a hat or sunblock?\nLeonard: No. That\xe2\x80\x99s not what he meant.\nSheldon: Well, we may never know. As my mother would say, the Asians are an inscrutable folk. Now, if you\xe2\x80\x99ll excuse me, I have work to do.\nLeonard: Yeah, you do. You dog, you.\nSheldon: Did you get that?\nAmy (on webcam): Every word. Our false gossip meme appears to have reached node lambda.\nSheldon: This is moving faster than we thought.\nAmy: Agreed. It appears the rate of gossip transmission is proportional to the number of nodes squared.\nSheldon: I must say, Amy, pretending to have intercourse with you is giving me a great deal of satisfaction.\nAmy: Slow down, Sheldon. I\xe2\x80\x99m not quite there yet.\nScene: The apartment, later.\nLeonard: Pass the soy sauce.\nHoward: Sure.\nAmy: Bernadette just asked about my sexual encounter with you. The meme has reached full penetration.\nSheldon: Pun intended?\nAmy: No. Happy accident.\nSheldon: This is remarkable. Took less than 24 hours.\nAmy: I should let you know that she asked for details about our dalliance.\nSheldon: Interesting. So it went beyond the mere fact of coitus to a blow by blow, as it were.\nAmy: Pun intended?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. What pun?\nAmy: Not important. I described your lovemaking as aloof, but effective.\nSheldon: I wish you hadn\xe2\x80\x99t done that. That\xe2\x80\x99s going to make me a chick magnet, and I\xe2\x80\x99m so busy as it is.\nHoward: Hey, everybody, I got something I want to ask Bernadette, and I can\xe2\x80\x99t think of a better time than when I\xe2\x80\x99m with all my friends.\nLeonard: Oh, hold on, Howard. There\xe2\x80\x99s lots of better times.\nRaj: Leonard, please. The man is talking. Let him get it out, and let the chips fall where they may.\nHoward: Thank you. Bernadette Maryann Rostenkowski\xe2\x80\xa6\nBernadette: Oh, God. What\xe2\x80\x99s happening?\nHoward: I know things haven\xe2\x80\x99t been perfect with us, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve had our problems, but I just have to tell you, from the moment I\xe2\x80\xa6\nBernadette: Howard, let me just stop you right here.\nRaj: This is it.\nBernadette: Yes.\nHoward: Yes, what?\nBernadette: Yes, I will marry you.\nHoward: You will?\nRaj: You will?\nBernadette: I will. I will!\nHoward: Oh, I love you so much.\nBernadette: Oh, I love you, too.\nLeonard: Congratulations!\nPriya: Oh, it\xe2\x80\x99s so exciting.\nAmy: I wonder what changed her mind.\nSheldon: Perhaps your talk of my sexual prowess renewed her faith in love.\nAmy: As good an explanation as any.\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99s great.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s door.\nPenny: Oh, hey, Amy. Bernadette just texted me. Howard proposed?\nAmy: Yes, not important. Just stopped by to let you know I\xe2\x80\x99m getting orthotics. Also, I\xe2\x80\x99m carrying Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s baby. Mum\xe2\x80\x99s the word.\nScene: The stairwell, moments later. Leonard is reading a text message.\nLeonard: You\xe2\x80\x99re pregnant?\nAmy: Wow. Is there anything on there about orthotics?\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
