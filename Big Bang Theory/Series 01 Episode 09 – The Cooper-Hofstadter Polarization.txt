b'Scene: The apartment, Leonard is attaching something to a lamp.\nLeonard: Okay, the X10s are online.\nHoward: Gentlemen, I am now about to send a signal from this laptop through our local ISP, racing down fibre-optic cable at the speed of light to San Francisco, bouncing off a satellite in geosynchronous orbit to Lisbon, Portugal, where the data packets will be handed off to submerged transatlantic cables terminating in Halifax, Nova-Scotia, and transferred across the continent via microwave relays back to our ISP and the X10 receiver attached to this (clicks mouse, lamp switches on) lamp. (The others cheer and clap).\nSheldon: Look at me, look at me, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got goosebumps.\nHoward: Are we ready on the stereo?\nRaj: Go for stereo.\n(Howard clicks mouse again. Also Sprach Zarathustra begins to play. At the climactic notes, the four jump in the air and begin pretend conducting or jumping about in time to the music.)\nPenny (entering): Hey guys.\nAll (calming down, embarrassed): Hello.\nPenny: It\xe2\x80\x99s a little loud.\nHoward: No problem, turning it down. (Using mouse again) San Francisco, Lisbon, Halifax (the music gets quieter) et voila.\nPenny: Okay, thanks.\nLeonard: Hang on, hang on, do you not realise what we just did.\nPenny: Yeah, you turned your stereo down with your laptop.\nSheldon: No, we turned our stereo down by sending a signal around the world via the internet.\nPenny: Oh. You know you can just get one of those universal remotes at Radio Shack, they\xe2\x80\x99re really cheap.\nLeonard: No, no, no, you don\xe2\x80\x99t get it, um, Howard, enable public access.\nHoward: Public access enabled. (They all stare around for a moment in silence.)\nPenny: Boy, that\xe2\x80\x99s brilliant, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll see you.\nLeonard: No, hang on, hang on. (The lamp goes off and on again.) See!\nPenny: No.\nSheldon: Someone in Sezchuan province, China is using his computer to turn our lights on and off.\nPenny: Huh, well that\xe2\x80\x99s handy. Um, here\xe2\x80\x99s a question, why?\nAll together: Because we can. (There is a loud noise)\nSheldon: They found the remote controlled cars.\nPenny: Well, wait, wait, what\xe2\x80\x99s on top of them.\nLeonard: Wireless webcams, wave hello.\nHoward: The monster truck is out of Austin, Texas, and the blue Viper is being operated from suburban Tel Aviv.\nSheldon: You may want to put on slacks.\nPenny: What? (Seeing red car is trying to get between her legs) Ew, stop it, no, leave me alone.\nLeonard: Who\xe2\x80\x99s running the red Corvette?\nHoward: That would be me.\nCredits sequence\nScene: The same, clearing up.\nSheldon: You know, in the future, when we\xe2\x80\x99re disembodied brains in jars, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to look back on this as eight hours well wasted.\nRaj: I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be in a jar. I want my brain in an android body. Eight feet tall and ripped.\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m with you. I just have to make sure if I\xe2\x80\x99m a synthetic human I\xe2\x80\x99d still be Jewish. I promised my mother.\nRaj: I suppose you could have your android penis circumcised. But that\xe2\x80\x99s something your Rabbi would have to discuss with the manufacturers.\nSheldon: Not to mention you\xe2\x80\x99d have to power down on Saturdays.\nLeonard: Sheldon, why is this letter in the trash?\nSheldon: Well, there\xe2\x80\x99s always the possibility that a trash can spontaneously formed around the letter, but Occam\xe2\x80\x99s Razor would suggest that someone threw it out.\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s from the Institute for Experimental Physics. They want us to present our paper on the properties of super solids at the topical conference on Bowes-Einstein condensates.\nSheldon: I know. I read it before I threw it out.\nLeonard: Okay\xe2\x80\xa6 if I may drill down to the bedrock of my question, why did you throw it out.\nSheldon: Because I have no interest in standing in the Rose Room of the Pasadena Marriott in front of a group of judgemental strangers, who wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t recognise true genius if it were standing in front of them giving a speech. Which, if I were there, it would be.\nHoward: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, Sheldon, those topical conferences on Bowes-Einstein condensates parties are legendary.\nLeonard: Forget the parties.\nHoward: Forget the parties? What a nerd.\nLeonard: Are there any other honours I\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten that I don\xe2\x80\x99t know about? Did UPS drop off a Nobel Prize with my name on it?\nSheldon: Leonard, please don\xe2\x80\x99t take this the wrong way, but the day you win a Nobel Prize, is the day I begin my research on the drag co-efficient of tassles on flying carpets.\nRaj: Hoo-hoo-hoo. The only thing missing from that insult was \xe2\x80\x9cyo mamma.\xe2\x80\x9d\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99ve got one, hey Leonard, your mamma\xe2\x80\x99s research methodology is so flawed\xe2\x80\xa6.\nLeonard: Shut up, Howard. Sheldon, we have to do this.\nSheldon: No we don\xe2\x80\x99t. We have to take in nourishment, expel waste, and inhale enough oxygen to keep ourselves from dying, everything else is optional.\nLeonard: Okay, let me put it this way, I\xe2\x80\x99m doing it.\nSheldon: You can\xe2\x80\x99t. I\xe2\x80\x99m the lead author.\nLeonard: Oh, come on. The only reason you\xe2\x80\x99re the lead author is because we went alphabetically.\nSheldon: I let you think we went alphabetically to spare you the humiliation of dealing with the fact that it was my idea. Not to put too fine a point on it, but I was throwing you a bone. You\xe2\x80\x99re welcome.\nLeonard: Excuse me, I designed the experiment that proved the hypothesis.\nSheldon: It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t need proving.\nLeonard: So the entire scientific community is just supposed to take your word?\nSheldon: They\xe2\x80\x99re not supposed to, but they should.\nLeonard: Alright, I don\xe2\x80\x99t care what you say, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to the conference and I\xe2\x80\x99m presenting our findings.\nSheldon: And I forbid it.\nLeonard: You forbid it?\nSheldon: If I\xe2\x80\x99m not taking credit for our work then nobody is.\nLeonard: Oh, you admit that it\xe2\x80\x99s our work.\nSheldon: No, once again, I\xe2\x80\x99m throwing you a bone. And once again, you are welcome.\nLeonard: Ah!\nHoward: Oh no he dit\xe2\x80\x99nt!\nScene: Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom. Penny is looking through his closet.\nPenny: So, how\xe2\x80\x99s it going with Sheldon, are you guys still not talking to each other?\nLeonard: Not only is he still not talking to me, but there\xe2\x80\x99s this thing he does where he stares at you and tries to get your brain to explode. You know, like in the classic sci-fi movie Scanners? (Put\xe2\x80\x99s fingers to head) You know, bzzz-pchew! Never mind. How about this one. It says, \xe2\x80\x9cI know my physics, but I\xe2\x80\x99m still a fun guy!\xe2\x80\x9d\nPenny: Oh, hey, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know they still made corduroy suits!\nLeonard: They don\xe2\x80\x99t, that\xe2\x80\x99s why I saved this one.\nPenny: Okay, well, let\xe2\x80\x99s just see what else you have. Okay, here, take this, and this, and this, and these.\nLeonard: Is this all stuff you want me to try on?\nPenny: No, this is stuff I want you to throw out.\nLeonard: Oh.\nPenny: Seriously, don\xe2\x80\x99t even give it to charity, you won\xe2\x80\x99t be helping anyone. What\xe2\x80\x99s this.\nLeonard: Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s the bottled city of Kandor.\nPenny: Uh-huh.\nLeonard: You see, Kandor was the capital city of the planet Krypton, it was miniaturised by Brainiac before Krypton exploded and then rescued by Superman.\nPenny: Oh, nice.\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s a lot cooler when girls aren\xe2\x80\x99t looking at it.\nPenny: Here, why don\xe2\x80\x99t you put these on while I find a shirt and sport-coat to match.\nLeonard: Great, be right back.\nPenny: Well, where you going, just put them on.\nLeonard: Here?\nPenny: Oh, are you shy?\nLeonard: No, I\xe2\x80\x99m not shy.\nPenny: Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry, I won\xe2\x80\x99t look.\nLeonard: I know you won\xe2\x80\x99t look, why would you look, there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to see, well, not nothing\xe2\x80\xa6.\nPenny: Sweetie, put the pants on.\nLeonard: Putting them on.\nPenny: So, you know, isn\xe2\x80\x99t there maybe some way you and Sheldon could compromise on this whole presentation thing.\nLeonard: No. No. Scientists do not compromise. Our minds are trained to synthesise facts and come to inarguable conclusions. Not to mention, Sheldon is batcrap crazy.\nPenny: What is this?\nLeonard: Oh, careful. That\xe2\x80\x99s my original series Battlestar Galactica flight suit.\nPenny: Oh, why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you wear it at Halloween?\nLeonard: Because it\xe2\x80\x99s not a costume, it\xe2\x80\x99s a flight suit.\nPenny: Okay, alright, moving on, oh, wow, a paisley shirt.\nLeonard: Uh-huh, it goes with my corduroy suit.\nPenny: If you mean it should end up in the same place then, I agree. Is this your\xe2\x80\xa6 your only tie?\nLeonard: Ah. Technically yes, but, if you\xe2\x80\x99ll notice, it\xe2\x80\x99s reversible. So it works as two.\nPenny: Oh, sweetie, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it even works as one. Is this all your clothes?\nLeonard: Yeah. Everything since the eighth grade.\nPenny: The\xe2\x80\xa6 the eighth grade?\nLeonard: My last growth spurt.\nPenny: Okay, well, I guess we\xe2\x80\x99re back to the corduroy suit.\nLeonard: Great.\nPenny: Yup. (Leonard picks up paisley shirt) I said no, put it down.\nScene: The ground floor hallway.\nPenny: Hey Sheldon!\nSheldon (unlocking his mailbox): Hello Penny.  \nPenny: Get anything good?\nSheldon: Uh, just the latest copy of Applied Particle Physics Quarterly.\nPenny: Oh, you know, that is so weird that yours came and mine didn\xe2\x80\x99t. (Sheldon looks confused). It was a joke. (Sheldon gives a fake laugh.) Yup, tip your waitresses, I\xe2\x80\x99m here all week.\nSheldon: Penny, just to save you from further awkwardness know that I\xe2\x80\x99m perfectly comfortable with the two of us climbing the stairs in silence.\nPenny: Oh yeah, me too. Zip it, lock it. (The begin to climb) Put it in your pocket. So you and Leonard\xe2\x80\xa6\nSheldon: Oh dear God!\nPenny: Little misunderstanding, huh.\nSheldon: A little misunder\xe2\x80\xa6. Galileo and the Pope had a little misunderstanding.\nPenny: Anyway, I was talking to Leonard this morning and I think he feels really bad about it.\nSheldon: Huh.\nPenny: Well how do you feel?\nSheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand the question.\nPenny: Well I\xe2\x80\x99m just asking if it\xe2\x80\x99s difficult to be fighting with your best friend.\nSheldon: Oh. I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t thought about it like that. I wonder if I\xe2\x80\x99ve been experiencing physiological manifestations of some sort of unconscious emotional turmoil.\nPenny: Wait\xe2\x80\xa6 what?\nSheldon: I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t poop this morning.\nPenny: You should just talk to him, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you guys can work this out.\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s certainly preferable to my plan.\nPenny: Which was?\nSheldon: A powerful laxative.\nPenny: Okay, so you absolutely should talk to him, look, I know Leonard values you as a friend, and he told me himself that without your little idea there\xe2\x80\x99s no way he could have come up with this whole experiment thing.\nSheldon: Excuse me, little idea?\nPenny: Yeah, I mean he tried to explain it to me, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t really understand it but\xe2\x80\xa6\nSheldon: Of course you didn\xe2\x80\x99t, he said little idea?\nPenny: Uh, well no, no, not in\xe2\x80\xa6 not in those words.\nSheldon: In what words then, exactly\nPenny: Um, gee, the exact words aren\xe2\x80\x99t written\xe2\x80\xa6 it\xe2\x80\x99s more the spirit in which it\xe2\x80\x99s\nSheldon: What did he say?\nPenny: You had a lucky hunch.\nLeonard (coming out of apartment): Hey, Sheldon, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been thinking, instead of arguing about this why don\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\xa6.\nSheldon: Don\xe2\x80\x99t you ever speak to me again.\nLeonard: What\xe2\x80\xa6 (Sheldon goes into apartment and slams the door).\nPenny: Uh, he\xe2\x80\xa6 (makes \xe2\x80\x9che\xe2\x80\x99s screwy\xe2\x80\x9d hand movements, turns to go).\nScene: The apartment. Leonard is dressed in the corduroy suit.\nLeonard: Okay, I\xe2\x80\x99m leaving for the conference.\nSheldon: Have fun presenting my lucky hunch.\nLeonard: Sheldon I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean it like that.\nSheldon: Then why did you say it.\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t choosing my\xe2\x80\xa6\nSheldon: Were you trying to impress Penny?\nLeonard: No, no not at all. A little bit.\nSheldon: How\xe2\x80\x99d that work out for you?\nPenny (entering): Leonard, ready to go?\nSheldon: Libido 1, truth zero.\nLeonard: Okay, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to ask you one more time, we did the work together, lets present the paper together.\nSheldon: And I\xe2\x80\x99m telling you for the last time it\xe2\x80\x99s pandering, it\xe2\x80\x99s undignified and bite me.\nLeonard: Let\xe2\x80\x99s go.\nPenny: Bye Sheldon.\nSheldon: Goodbye Penny. (Places fingers to head to try to make Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s brain explode. Leonard leaves.) Oooh, one of these days, Pkshhhh!\nScene: A corridor at the conference. Penny is attaching Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s name tag.\nPenny: There you go.\nLeonard: You\xe2\x80\x99re right, this side does look better.\nPenny: No, no, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t say better, I said less stained.\nHoward: I just checked the house, there\xe2\x80\x99s probably twenty, twenty-five people in there.\nLeonard: You\xe2\x80\x99re kidding.\nPenny: Is that all?\nLeonard: All? In particle physics, twenty five is Woodstock.\nPenny: Oh, well, then good!\nLeonard: I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t expecting such a crowd, I\xe2\x80\x99m a little nervous.\nHoward: It\xe2\x80\x99s okay, just open with a joke, you\xe2\x80\x99ll be fine.\nLeonard: A joke. Okay. How about this, um, okay, uh there\xe2\x80\x99s this farmer, and he has these chickens, but they won\xe2\x80\x99t lay any eggs. So, he calls a physicist to help. The physicist then does some calculations, and he says, um, I have a solution, but it only works with spherical chickens in a vacuum. (Raj and Howard laugh.) Right?\nPenny: Oh, sorry, I\xe2\x80\x99ve just, I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard it before.\nHoward: Let\xe2\x80\x99s roll. Hey, nice suit.\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s a classic, right?\nPenny: I really should have brought my own car.\nScene: Leonard is presenting.\nLeonard: So, in conclusion, the data show that at temperatures approaching absolute zero, the moment of inertia changes, and the solid becomes a super-solid, which clearly appears to be a previously unknown state of matter. (Applause) Thank you. (Penny is asleep on Howard\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder. Howard is taking a photograph with his camera phone.) Are there any questions?\nVoice: Yeah. What the hell was that?\nLeonard: Any other questions?\nSheldon (who previously spoke, now removing his hood and dark glasses): Doctor Sheldon Cooper here, I am the lead author of this particular paper. (No reaction.) Thank you. And you, sir, you have completely skipped over the part where I was walking through the park, and I saw these children on a merry-go-round, which started me thinking about the moment of inertia in gasses like helium at temperatures approaching absolute zero.\nLeonard: I didn\xe2\x80\x99t skip it, it\xe2\x80\x99s just an anecdote. It\xe2\x80\x99s not science.\nSheldon: Oh, I see, was the apple falling on Newton\xe2\x80\x99s head, was that just an anecdote?\nLeonard: You are not Isaac Newton.\nSheldon: No, no that\xe2\x80\x99s true, gravity would have been apparent to me without the apple.\nLeonard: You cannot possibly be that arrogant.\nSheldon: You continue to underestimate me, my good man.\nLeonard: Look, if you weren\xe2\x80\x99t happy with my presentation then maybe you should have given it with me.\nSheldon: As I have explained repeatedly, unlike you, I don\xe2\x80\x99t need validation from lesser minds. No offence.\nLeonard: Really, so why did you come?\nSheldon: Because I knew you\xe2\x80\x99d screw this up.\nLeonard: I didn\xe2\x80\x99t screw it up.\nSheldon: Oh, please. I admit, that spherical chicken joke, that was hilarious. But it was straight downhill from there.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99ve had enough of your condescension. Maybe I didn\xe2\x80\x99t go to college when I was eleven like you, maybe I got my doctorate at 24 instead of 16, but you are not the only person who is smarter than everyone else in this room. No offense. And I am clearly not the only person who is tormented by insecurity and has an ego in need of constant validation.\nSheldon: So you admit that you\xe2\x80\x99re an egotist?\nLeonard: Yes. (To audience) My name is Dr Leonard Hofstadter, and I could never please my parents so I need to get all my self-esteem from strangers like you. But he\xe2\x80\x99s worse.\nSheldon: Okay, that is it. (Tries to explode brain again.)\nLeonard: You cannot blow up my head with your mind.\nSheldon: Then I\xe2\x80\x99ll settle for an aneurysm.\nLeonard (knocking his hands down): Stop it.\nSheldon: You hit me. You saw him, he hit me.\nLeonard: You were trying to blow up my head.\nSheldon: So it was working.\nLeonard: It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t, it was not, you are a nutcase.\nSheldon: Oh we\xe2\x80\x99ll see about that (tries again), heads up you people in the front row, this is a splash zone.\nLeonard: Stop, stop it, quit it. (The start to fight.)\nPenny: Is this usually how these physics things go?\nHoward: More often than you\xe2\x80\x99d think.\nLeonard (getting Sheldon on floor): Vulcan nerve pinch!\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: You could have offered me a ride home.\nLeonard: You\xe2\x80\x99re lucky I didn\xe2\x80\x99t run you over.\nSheldon: I really don\xe2\x80\x99t understand what you\xe2\x80\x99re so unhappy about, you begged me to come, I came, there\xe2\x80\x99s just no pleasing you.\nLeonard: You\xe2\x80\x99re right, I\xe2\x80\x99m the problem, I\xe2\x80\x99m the one that needs help.\nSheldon: Well that\xe2\x80\x99s not much of an apology, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll take it.\nLeonard: Excuse me. Is there anything you\xe2\x80\x99d like to apologise for?\nSheldon: Yes. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry I tried to blow up your head. It was uncalled for.\nHoward (entering with Raj): You won\xe2\x80\x99t believe this.\nRaj: Somebody got the whole thing on a cell phone and put it on youtube.\nLeonard: What?\nSheldon: Now, who would do that?\nHoward: That would be me. Hey, check it out, it\xe2\x80\x99s a featured video. (The watch).\nLeonard: Oh jeez. Is this suit really look that bad?\nSheldon: Forget your suit, look at my arms waving, I\xe2\x80\x99m like a flamingo on Ritalin.\nPenny (entering): Howard, would you like to explain to me why your facebook page has a picture of me sleeping on your shoulder captioned \xe2\x80\x9cMe and my Girlfriend?\xe2\x80\x9d\nHoward: Uh-oh, here comes \xe2\x80\x9cthe talk.\xe2\x80\x9d\nPenny tries to make Howard\xe2\x80\x99s brain explode.\nScene: Captioned \xe2\x80\x9cSomewhere in China\xe2\x80\x9d, two Chinese students watch the video on their computer.\nStudent one (in captions): What losers.\nStudent two: Yeah. Gigantic American geeks. (The lights flicker)\nStudent one:  Who\xe2\x80\x99s doing that?\nStudent two: Someone from Pasadena, California named\xe2\x80\xa6 \xe2\x80\x9cWolowizard.\xe2\x80\x9d\nTogether: Awesome!\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
