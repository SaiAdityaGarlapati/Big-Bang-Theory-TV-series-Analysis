b'Scene: Sheldon and Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s apartment. Sheldon, Leonard, Howard and Raj are present.\nLeonard: There you go, Pad Thai, no peanuts.\nHoward: But does it have peanut oil?\nLeonard: Uh, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure, everyone keep an eye on Howard in case he starts to swell up.\nSheldon: Since it\xe2\x80\x99s not bee season, you can have my epinephrine.\nRaj: Are there any chopsticks?\nSheldon: You don\xe2\x80\x99t need chopsticks, this is Thai food.\nLeonard: Here we go.\nSheldon: Thailand has had the fork since the latter half of the nineteenth century. Interestingly they don\xe2\x80\x99t actually put the fork in their mouth, they use it to put the food on a spoon which then goes into their mouth.\nLeonard: Ask him for a napkin, I dare you. (There is a knock on the door.) I\xe2\x80\x99ll get it.\nHoward: Do I look puffy? I feel puffy.\n(Leonard opens door to Penny, steps into hallway)\nPenny: Hey Leonard.\nLeonard: Oh, hi Penny.\nPenny: Am I interrupting.\nLeonard: No.\nSheldon (off): You\xe2\x80\x99re not swelling, Howard.\nHoward (off): No, no, look at my fingers, they\xe2\x80\x99re like Vienna sausages.\nPenny: Sounds like you have company.\nLeonard: They\xe2\x80\x99re not going anywhere. (Closes door, staying in hallway.) So, you\xe2\x80\x99re coming home from work. That\xe2\x80\x99s great. How was work.\nPenny: Well, you know, it\xe2\x80\x99s the Cheesecake Factory. People order cheesecake, and I bring it to them.\nLeonard: So, you sort of act as a carbohydrate delivery system.\nPenny: Yeah, call it whatever you want, I get minimum wage. Yeah, anyways, I was wondering if you could help me out with something, I was\xe2\x80\xa6.\nLeonard: Yes.\nPenny: Oh. Okay, great, I\xe2\x80\x99m having some furniture delivered tomorrow, and I may not be here, so\xe2\x80\xa6. (apartment door opens, Sheldon, Raj and Howard appear) Oh! Hel\xe2\x80\xa6hello!\nHoward: (speaks a phrase in Russian).\nPenny: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry?\nHoward: Haven\xe2\x80\x99t you ever been told how beautiful you are in flawless Russian?\nPenny: No, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t.\nHoward: Get used to it.\nPenny: Yeah, I probably won\xe2\x80\x99t, but\xe2\x80\xa6 Hey Sheldon.\nSheldon: Hi.\nPenny: Hey Raj! (Raj looks uncomfortable) Still not talking to me, huh?\nSheldon: Don\xe2\x80\x99t take it personally, it\xe2\x80\x99s his pathology, he can\xe2\x80\x99t talk to women.\nHoward: He can\xe2\x80\x99t talk to attractive women, or in your case a cheesecake\xe2\x80\x93scented Goddess!\nLeonard: So, there\xe2\x80\x99s gonna be some furniture delivered?\nPenny: Yeah, yeah, if it gets here and I\xe2\x80\x99m not here tomorrow could you just sign for it and have them put it in my apartment.\nLeonard: Yeah, no problem.\nPenny: Great, here\xe2\x80\x99s my spare key. Thank you.\nLeonard: Penny, wait.\nPenny: Yeah?\nLeonard: Um, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t have any other plans, do you want to join us for Thai food and a Superman movie marathon?\nPenny: A marathon? Wow, how many Superman movies are there?\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re kidding, right?\nPenny: Yeah, I do like the one where Lois Lane falls from the helicopter and Superman swooshes down and catches her, which one was that?\nLeonard,Sheldon and Howard together: One. (Raj raises one finger).\nSheldon: You realise that scene was rife with scientific inaccuracy.\nPenny: Yes, I know, men can\xe2\x80\x99t fly.\nSheldon: Oh no, let\xe2\x80\x99s assume that they can. Lois Lane is falling, accelerating at an initial rate of 32 feet per second per second. Superman swoops down to save her by reaching out two arms of steel. Miss Lane, who is now travelling at approximately 120 miles per hour, hits them, and is immediately sliced into three equal pieces.\nLeonard: Unless, Superman matches her speed and decelerates.\nSheldon: In what space, sir, in what space? She\xe2\x80\x99s two feet above the ground. Frankly, if he really loved her, he\xe2\x80\x99d let her hit the pavement. It would be a more merciful death.\nLeonard: Excuse me, your entire argument is predicated on the assumption that Superman\xe2\x80\x99s flight is a feat of strength.\nSheldon: Are you listening to yourself, it is well established that Superman\xe2\x80\x99s flight is a feat of strength, it is an extension of his ability to leap tall buildings, an ability he derives from Earth\xe2\x80\x99s yellow Sun.\nHoward: Yeah, and you don\xe2\x80\x99t have a problem with that, how does he fly at night.\nSheldon: Uh, a combination of the moon\xe2\x80\x99s solar reflection and the energy storage capacity of Kryptonian skin cells.\nPenny: I\xe2\x80\x99m just going to go wash up.\nLeonard: I have 26 hundred comic books in there, I challenge you to find a single reference to Kryptonian skin cells.\nSheldon: Challenge accepted. (Tries door.) We\xe2\x80\x99re locked out.\nRaj: Also, the pretty girl left.\nCredit sequence.\nScene: Ground floor hallway of the apartment building. Leonard is signing for the delivery.\nLeonard: Okay, her apartment\xe2\x80\x99s on the fourth floor but the elevator\xe2\x80\x99s broken so you\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to (delivery man leaves) oh, you\xe2\x80\x99re just going to be done, okay, cool, thanks. I guess we\xe2\x80\x99ll just bring it up ourselves.\nSheldon: I hardly think so.\nLeonard: Why not?\nSheldon: Well, we don\xe2\x80\x99t have a dolly, or lifting belts, or any measurable upper body strength.\nLeonard: We don\xe2\x80\x99t need strength, we\xe2\x80\x99re physicists. We are the intellectual descendents of Archimedes. Give me a fulcrum and a lever and I can move the Earth, it\xe2\x80\x99s just a matter\xe2\x80\xa6 (starts to move package) I don\xe2\x80\x99t have this\xe2\x80\xa6 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have this I don\xe2\x80\x99t have this.\nSheldon: Archimedes would be so proud.\nLeonard: Do you have any ideas?\nSheldon: Yes, but they all involve a green lantern and a power ring.\nTime shift, Leonard and Sheldon are now lowering the package onto the bottom of the stairs.\nLeonard: Easy, easy (package falls) Okay! Now we\xe2\x80\x99ve got an inclined plane. The force required to lift is reduced by the sine of the angle of the stairs, call it thirty degrees, so about half.\nSheldon: Exactly half.\nLeonard (snarkily): Exactly half. Let\xe2\x80\x99s push. Okay, see, it\xe2\x80\x99s moving, this is easy, all in the math.\nSheldon: What\xe2\x80\x99s your formula for the corner.\nLeonard: What? Oh, okay, uh, okay, yeah, no problem, just come up here and help me pull and turn.\n(Sheldon heads up the stairs. The package slides back down to the bottom.)\nSheldon: Ah, gravity, thou art a heartless bitch.\nTime shift, they now have the package on an upstairs hallway, not their own.\nSheldon: You do understand that our efforts here will in no way increase the odds of you having sexual congress with this woman?\nLeonard: Men do things for women without expecting sex.\nSheldon: Yeah, those are men who just had sex.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m doing this to be a good neighbour. In any case, there\xe2\x80\x99s no way it could lower the odds.\nQuick cut to the hallway of their floor, they are nearing the top of the staircase.\nLeonard: Almost there, almost there, almost there. (Lets go of package, it starts to slip down)\nSheldon: No we\xe2\x80\x99re not, no we\xe2\x80\x99re not, no we\xe2\x80\x99re not.\nScene: Inside Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment. They are laying the package down on the floor.\nSheldon: Watch your fingers. Watch your fingers. Oh God, my fingers!\nLeonard: You okay?\nSheldon: No, it hurt\xe2\x80\xa6 (looking around) Great Caesar\xe2\x80\x99s Ghost, look at this place?\nLeonard: So Penny\xe2\x80\x99s a little messy.\nSheldon: A little messy? The Mandelbrot set of complex numbers is a little messy, this is chaos. Excuse me, explain to me an organisational system where a tray of flatware on a couch is valid. I\xe2\x80\x99m just inferring that this is a couch, because the evidence suggests the coffee table\xe2\x80\x99s having a tiny garage sale.\nLeonard: Did it ever occur to you that not everyone has the compulsive need to sort, organise and label the entire world around them?\nSheldon: No.\nLeonard: Well they don\xe2\x80\x99t. Hard as it may be for you to believe, most people don\xe2\x80\x99t sort their breakfast cereal numerically by fibre content.\nSheldon: Excuse me, but I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve both found that helpful at times.\nLeonard: Come on, we should go.\nSheldon: Hang on.\nLeonard: What are you doing?\nSheldon: Straightening up.\nLeonard: Sheldon, this is not your home.\nSheldon: This is not anyone\xe2\x80\x99s home, this is a swirling vortex of entropy.\nLeonard: When the transvestite lived here, you didn\xe2\x80\x99t care how he kept the place.\nSheldon: Because it was immaculate, I mean, you open that man\xe2\x80\x99s closet, it was left to right, evening gowns, cocktail dresses, then his police uniforms.\nLeonard: What were you doing in his closet?\nSheldon: I helped run some cable for a webcam.\nPenny (entering): Hey guys.\nLeonard: Oh, hey Penny, this just arrived, we just brought this up, just now.\nPenny: Great. Was it hard getting it up the stairs?\nSheldon: (sucks in breath)\nLeonard: No.\nSheldon: No?\nLeonard: No.\nSheldon: No.\nLeonard: Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ll get out of your hair.\nPenny: Oh, great, thank you again (she throws her jacket over the back of the sofa).\nSheldon: Penny, I just want you to know that, you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to live like this. I\xe2\x80\x99m here for you.\nPenny: What\xe2\x80\x99s he talking about?\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s a joke.\nPenny: I don\xe2\x80\x99t get it.\nLeonard: Yeah, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t tell it right.\nScene: Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom, he is asleep. Sound of door opening and closing somewhere else is heard. Leonard wakes, puts on his glasses and looks at the clock. It is 2:16.\nLeonard: Sheldon?\nScene: The living room. Leonard enters carrying a light sabre.\nLeonard: Sheldon? Hello?\n(Notices front door is open, turns off light sabre.)\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment, penny is sleeping, Sheldon is cleaning. Leonard enters.\nLeonard: Sheldon!\nSheldon: Sssshhhh! Penny\xe2\x80\x99s sleeping.\nLeonard: Are you insane, you can\xe2\x80\x99t just break into a woman\xe2\x80\x99s apartment in the middle of the night and clean.\nSheldon: I had no choice. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t sleep knowing that just outside my bedroom was our living room, and just outside our living room was that hallway, and immediately adjacent to that hallway was\xe2\x80\xa6 this.\nLeonard: Do you realise that if Penny wakes up, there is no reasonable explanation as to why we\xe2\x80\x99re here?\nSheldon: I just gave you a reasonable explanation.\nLeonard: No, no. You gave me an explanation, it\xe2\x80\x99s reasonableness will be determined by a jury of your peers.\nSheldon: Don\xe2\x80\x99t be ridiculous. I have no peers.\nLeonard: Sheldon, we have to get out of here.\n(Penny snores)\nSheldon: You might want to speak in a lower register.\nLeonard: What?\nSheldon: Evolution has made women sensitive to high pitched noises while they sleep, so that they\xe2\x80\x99ll be roused by a crying baby. If you want to avoid waking her, speak in a lower register.\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99s ridiculous. (Penny snores again.)\nSheldon: No, (lowering his voice dramatically,) that\xe2\x80\x99s ridiculous.\nLeonard (doing likewise): Fine. I accept your premise, now please let\xe2\x80\x99s go.\nSheldon: I am not leaving until I\xe2\x80\x99m done.\nLeonard: O-o-o-oh! (Collapses against wall).\nSheldon: If you have time to lean, you have time to clean.\nLeonard: Oh, what the hell.\nScene: Sheldon and Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s living room, morning. Sheldon enters, singing to himself.\nSheldon: Morning.\nLeonard: Morning.\nSheldon: I have to say, I slept splendidly. Granted, not long, but just deeply and well.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m not surprised. A well known folk cure for insomnia is to break into your neighbour\xe2\x80\x99s apartment and clean.\nSheldon: Sarcasm?\nLeonard: You think?\nSheldon: Granted, my methods may have been somewhat unorthodox, but I think the end result will be a measurable enhancement of Penny\xe2\x80\x99s quality of life.\nLeonard: You know what, you\xe2\x80\x99ve convinced me, maybe tonight we should sneak in and shampoo her carpet.\nSheldon: You don\xe2\x80\x99t think that crosses a line?\nLeonard: Yes! For God\xe2\x80\x99s sake, Sheldon, do I have to hold up a sarcasm sign every time I open my mouth.\nSheldon: You have a sarcasm sign?\nLeonard: No, I do not have a sarcasm sign.\nSheldon: Do you want some cereal. I\xe2\x80\x99m feeling so good today I\xe2\x80\x99m going to choose from the low fibre end of the shelf. Hello, Honey Puffs.\nPenny (voice off): Son of a Bitch!\nLeonard: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s up.\nPenny (voice off): You sick, geeky bastards!\nLeonard: How did she know it was us?\nSheldon: I may have left a suggested organisational schematic for her bedroom closet.\nPenny (voice off): Leonard!\nLeonard: God, this is going to be bad.\nSheldon: Goodbye, Honey Puffs, hello Big Bran.\nPenny (entering): You came into my apartment last night when I was sleeping?\nLeonard: Yes, but, only to clean.\nSheldon: Really more to organise, you\xe2\x80\x99re not actually dirty, per se.\nPenny: Give me back my key.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m very, very sorry.\nPenny: Do you understand how creepy this is.\nLeonard: Oh, yes, we discussed it at length last night.\nPenny: In my apartment, while I was sleeping.\nSheldon: And snoring. And that\xe2\x80\x99s probably just a sinus infection, but it could be sleep apnoea, you might want to see an otolaryngologist. It\xe2\x80\x99s a throat doctor.\nPenny: And what kind of doctor removes shoes from asses?\nSheldon: Depending on the depth, that\xe2\x80\x99s either a proctologist or a general surgeon. (Leonard holds up a sign reading \xe2\x80\x9cSarcasm\xe2\x80\x9d) Oh!\nPenny: God!\nLeonard: Okay, look, no Penny, I think what you\xe2\x80\x99re feeling is perfectly valid, and maybe a little bit later today when you\xe2\x80\x99re feeling a little bit less, for lack of a better word, violated, maybe we could talk about this some more.\nPenny: Stay away from me.\nLeonard: Sure, that\xe2\x80\x99s another way to go.\nSheldon: Penny, Penny, just to clarify because there will be a discussion when you leave, is your objection solely to our presence in the apartment while you were sleeping, or do you also object to the imposition of a new organisational paradigm. (Penny stares in disbelief, then leaves.) Well that was a little non-responsive.\nLeonard: You are going to march yourself over there right now and apologise. (Sheldon laughs.) What\xe2\x80\x99s funny?\nSheldon: That wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sarcasm?\nLeonard: No.\nSheldon: Wooh, boy, you are all over the place this morning. (Knocks on Penny\xe2\x80\x99s door.) I have a masters and two PhD\xe2\x80\x99s, I should not have to do this.\nPenny (opening door): What?\nSheldon: I am truly sorry for what happened last night, I take full responsibility. And I hope that it won\xe2\x80\x99t colour your opinion of Leonard, who is not only a wonderful guy, but also, I hear, a gentle and thorough lover. (Penny closes door in his face.) I did what I could.\nScene: The stairwell. Raj is coming up the stairs, he meets Penny who is going down.\nPenny: Hey Raj. (Raj stands looking uncomfortable.) Hey, listen, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if you heard about what happened last night with Leonard and Sheldon, but I\xe2\x80\x99m really upset about it, I mean they just, they let themselves into my place, and then they cleaned it, I mean can you even believe that? How weird is that?\nRaj (internally, while Penny continues to talk): Ooh, she\xe2\x80\x99s standing very close to me. Oh my, she does smell good. What is that, vanilla?\nPenny: You know, where I come from, someone comes into your house at night, you shoot, okay? And you don\xe2\x80\x99t shoot to wound. I mean, alright, my sister shot her husband, but it was an accident, they were drunk. What was I saying?\nRaj (internally): She\xe2\x80\x99s so chatty. Maybe my parents are right. Maybe I\xe2\x80\x99d be better off with an Indian girl. We\xe2\x80\x99d have the same cultural background, and my wife would sing to my children the same lullabies my mother sang to me.\nPenny: It\xe2\x80\x99s obvious that they meant well, but I\xe2\x80\x99m just, I\xe2\x80\x99m having a really rough time, like I said, I broke up with my boyfriend, and it\xe2\x80\x99s just freaking me out.\nRaj (internally sings an Indian lullaby.)\nPenny: I mean, just because most of the men I\xe2\x80\x99ve known in my life happen to be jerks, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean I should just assume Leonard and Sheldon are. Right?\nRaj (internally): She asked me a question. I should probably nod. (Does.)\nPenny: That\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what I thought. Thank you for listening. You\xe2\x80\x99re a doll. (She hugs him.)\nRaj (internally): Oh-oh. Turn your pelvis. (Does.)\nScene: Sheldon and Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s living room. Howard is there, playing on a dance video game.\nHoward (jumping off game mat): Grab a napkin, homie. You just got served.\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s fine. You win.\nHoward: What\xe2\x80\x99s his problem?\nSheldon: His imaginary girlfriend broke up with him.\nHoward: Been there.\nRaj (entering): Hello. Sorry I\xe2\x80\x99m late. But I was in the hallway, chatting up Penny.\nHoward: Really? You? Rajesh Koothrapali, spoke to Penny?\nRaj: Actually, I was less the chatter than the chattee.\nLeonard: What did she say? Is she still mad at me?\nRaj: Well, she was upset at first, but, probably because her sister shot somebody. Then there was something about you and\xe2\x80\xa6 then she hugged me.\nHoward: She hugged you? How did she hug you? (Raj hugs Howard.) Is that her perfume I smell?\nRaj: intoxicating, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\nScene: The hallway, Leonard puts a note under Penny\xe2\x80\x99s door. It opens.\nPenny: Hi.\nLeonard: Oh.\nPenny: What\xe2\x80\x99s going on?\nLeonard: Um, here\xe2\x80\x99s the thing. (Reads from note.) Penny. Just as Oppenheimer came to regret his contributions to the first atomic bomb, so too I regret my participation in what was, at the very least, an error in judgement. The hallmark of the great human experiment is the willingness to recognise one\xe2\x80\x99s mistakes. Some mistakes, such as Madame Curie\xe2\x80\x99s discovery of Radium turned out to have great scientific potential even though she would later die a slow, painful death from radiation poisoning. Another example, from the field of ebola research\xe2\x80\xa6.\nPenny: Leonard.\nLeonard: Yeah.\nPenny (hugs him): We\xe2\x80\x99re okay. (Kisses him on cheek. Closes door. Leonard looks happy, walks back across hallway and straight into the apartment door.)\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment. Sheldon and Leonard are trying to construct furniture.\nLeonard: Six two inch dowels.\nSheldon: Check.\nLeonard: One package, Phillips head screws.\nSheldon: Check.\nPenny: Guys, seriously, I grew up on a farm, okay, I rebuilt a tractor engine when I was like twelve, I think I can put together a cheap Swedish media centre.\nLeonard: No, please, we insist, it\xe2\x80\x99s the least we can do considering.\nSheldon: Considering what? How great this place looks?\nHoward (across room with Raj): Oh boy, I was afraid of this.\nLeonard: What?\nHoward: These instructions are a pictographic representation of the least imaginative way to assemble these components. This right here is why Sweden has no space program.\nPenny: Well, uh, it looked pretty good in the store.\nLeonard: It is an inefficient design, for example Penny has a flat screen TV, which means all the space behind it is wasted.\nSheldon: We could put her stereo back there.\nLeonard: And control it how?\nSheldon: Run an infra-red repeater, photocell here, emitter here, easy peasy.\nHoward (after Raj whispers in his ear): Good point, how you gonna cool it?\nPenny: Hey guys, I got this.\nSheldon: Hang on Penny. How about fans, here and here?\nLeonard: Also inefficient, and might be loud.\nHoward: How about liquid coolant? Maybe a little aquarium pump here, run some quarter inch PVC\xe2\x80\xa6\nPenny: Guys, this is actually really simple.\nHoward: Hold on, honey, men at work. The PVC comes down here, maybe a little corrugated sheet metal as a radiator here.\nLeonard: Oh, really, show me where we put a drip tray, a sluice and an overflow reservoir?\nSheldon: And if water is involved we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to ground the crap out of the thing.\nPenny: Guys, it\xe2\x80\x99s hot in here, I think I\xe2\x80\x99ll just take off all my clothes.\nLeonard: Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got it. How about if we replace panels A, B and F and crossbar H with aircraft grade aluminium.\nSheldon: Right, then the entire thing\xe2\x80\x99s one big heat sink.\nHoward: Perfect, Leonard, why don\xe2\x80\x99t you and Sheldon go down to the junk yard and pick up about six square metres of scrap aluminium, Raj and I will run down to my lab and get the oxy-acetaline torch.\nLeonard: Meet back here in an hour?\nHoward: Done.\nLeonard: Got it. (They all leave).\nPenny: Okay, this place does look pretty good.\nTeleplay: Robert Cohen & Dave Goetsch\nStory: Chuck Lorre & Bill Prady\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
