b'Scene: A camp site.\nHoward: How much time do we have?\nLeonard: Uh, t-minus five hours, 37 minutes to onset of meteor shower.\nRaj: Okay, our position is 34.48 degrees north, 118.31 west. That means the azimuth should be 168.22 degrees relative to magnetic north with an elevation of 49.93.\nHoward: Anything yet?\nLeonard: Uh, we have a signal, but there\xe2\x80\x99s no frame lock.\nHoward: Hang on, how about now?\nRaj: We did it. We have the west coast feed of HBO.\nHoward: Ooh, Real Sex.\nRaj: Big deal. Every time I watch that show it\xe2\x80\x99s old women putting condoms on cucumbers.\nHoward: Alright, let\xe2\x80\x99s see what\xe2\x80\x99s on the east coast feed.\nLeonard: Oh, hey. Dune.\nRaj: Not a great movie, but look at that beautiful desert.\nLeonard: Too bad Sheldon couldn\xe2\x80\x99t come with us.\nRaj: Yes, it\xe2\x80\x99s not the same without him. (They all laugh)\nHoward: Oh, this sucks, I\xe2\x80\x99m switching back to Real Sex.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s log, stardate 63345.3. While my colleagues are off observing the Leonid meteor shower, I have remained behind to complete my paper on the decays of highly excited massive string states. Although my research is going well I do miss the warmth of human companionship. (He laughs)\n  Credits sequence.\n  Scene: The apartment.\n  Sheldon: And good evening to you, Siam Palace. This is Sheldon Cooper. Yeah, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to be dining alone this evening, so I\xe2\x80\x99ll be reducing my usual order. I\xe2\x80\x99d like to start with one quarter of the assorted appetizers plate and, uh, one half of the golden treasure for two. Oh, for heaven\xe2\x80\x99s sake, in the mid-18th century, King Rama IV of Siam divided a huge empire amongst the colonial powers of Europe in order to preserve his throne. Surely, you, his cultural descendant, can handle pad thai and dumplings.\nPenny (voice off): Sheldon help!\nSheldon: I need to go, but you keep in mind that my sharply worded comments on yelp.com recently took down a local muffin store. (At Penny\xe2\x80\x99s door, knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny..\nPenny: Come in! Hurry!\nSheldon: Penny?\nPenny: I\xe2\x80\x99m back here.\nSheldon: (At Penny\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom door, knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny..\nPenny: Oh, for god\xe2\x80\x99s sakes, I\xe2\x80\x99m in the bathroom!\nSheldon: Shall I come back at a better time?\nPenny: Get in here! Hurry! Don\xe2\x80\x99t you dare knock.\nSheldon: Hello.\nPenny: I slipped in the shower, and I think I dislocated my shoulder.\nSheldon: Not surprising. You have no safety mat or adhesive stickers to allow for purchase on a surface with a low coefficient of static friction.\nPenny: What?\nSheldon: Tubs are slippery.\nPenny: I know. I slipped.\nSheldon: I have a series of whimsical duck stickers on the bottom of my tub.\nPenny: Yeah, okay, whatever. Will you just turn the water off and help me up?\nSheldon: They\xe2\x80\x99re holding umbrellas.\nPenny: What?\nSheldon: The ducks in my tub.\nPenny: Uh-huh.\nSheldon: They\xe2\x80\x99re whimsical because ducks have neither the need for, nor the ability to use umbrellas.\nPenny: Oh, my god. I got to go to the emergency room.\nSheldon: Well, assuming you\xe2\x80\x99re correct that your right humerus is no longer seated in the glenoid socket, I would certainly think so.\nPenny: Okay, can you drive me?\nSheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t drive.\nPenny: Well, I can\xe2\x80\x99t drive!\nSheldon: Well, it seems we\xe2\x80\x99ve reached an impasse.\nPenny: Ow.\nSheldon: But I could call you a cab or an ambulance.\nPenny: No, no, no, I can\xe2\x80\x99t wait that long, you got to help me, please.\nSheldon: All right. Let it never be said that Sheldon Lee Cooper ignored the pleas of a damsel in distress.\nPenny: No one\xe2\x80\x99s saying that. Let\xe2\x80\x99s go.\nSheldon: Well, it does seem rather ironic that for want of 99-cent adhesive ducks, we both might die in a fiery car crash.\nScene: The camp site.\n  Leonard: I wish Penny didn\xe2\x80\x99t have to work, she loves camping.\nRaj: Yeah, that would have been great. You and Penny having sex in the tent while I sit out here and watch Howard hump a cactus.\nHoward: Okay, the best I can tell, there are eight other campsites nearby. Mostly science nerds like us, but just over yon ridge are two not unattractive middle school teachers who reek of desperation.\nRaj: Wow. Wonderful. How old are they?\nHoward: Oh I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, 50, 55.\nRaj: Oh, menopause, nature\xe2\x80\x99s birth control.\nLeonard: Come on, you guys can\xe2\x80\x99t be that hard up.\nHoward: I am.\nRaj: Yeah, me, too.\nHoward: Look, they gave me homemade cookies.\nLeonard: Of course, they did. That\xe2\x80\x99s what grandmothers do.\nRaj: So, what are we waiting for?\nHoward: Relax, I said we\xe2\x80\x99d stop by a little later after they have their nap.\nRaj: Good idea. They\xe2\x80\x99ll be refreshed.\nHoward: Cookie?\nRaj: Yeah, thank you. Mmmm.\nLeonard: Mmmm, not bad.\nRaj: Yeah, very tasty. Well, so tell me more about these teachers.\nHoward: Not much to tell. They had a VW Microbus and were wearing tie-dyed Grateful Dead shirts.\nRaj: Huh. Mmm. Good cookies.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom.\nSheldon: I see no organizational system in here whatsoever. Which panties do you wear on Mondays?\nPenny: I don\xe2\x80\x99t need panties, I just need shorts and a shirt.\nSheldon: My mother always told me one should wear clean underpants in case one is in an accident.\nPenny: One was already in an accident.\nSheldon: That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean one won\xe2\x80\x99t be in another, especially if I\xe2\x80\x99m driving.\nPenny: Clothes, Sheldon. I need clothes!\nSheldon: Okay, here.\nPenny: Seriously? Those shorts with that top?\nSheldon: All right.\nPenny: No\xe2\x80\xa6 No\xe2\x80\xa6 Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s cute.\nSheldon: We should have you checked for a concussion.\nPenny: Okay, now, you got to help me put these on.\nSheldon: All right.\nPenny: But don\xe2\x80\x99t look.\nSheldon: Don\xe2\x80\x99t look?\nPenny: I don\xe2\x80\x99t want you to see me naked.\nSheldon: Oh. Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s understandable. You may be interested to know that a prohibition against looking is well established in heroic mythology. Uh, Lot and his wife, Perseus and Medusa, Orpheus and Eurydice.\nPenny: Yeah, great.\nSheldon: They always look. It never ends well.\nPenny: Ok, now you gotta help me get my arm into the sleeve.\nSheldon: Ok.\nPenny: Is that my arm?\nSheldon: It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t feel like an arm.\nPenny: Then, maybe you should let it go.\nSheldon: All righty.\nScene: The camp site.\nLeonard: Stars are pretty, aren\xe2\x80\x99t they?\nHoward: Up above the world so high, like little diamonds in the sky.\nRaj: That\xe2\x80\x99s beautiful, dude. You should\xe2\x80\xa6 You should write that down before someone steals it.\nHoward: So, when do the meteors get here?\nRaj: The meteors don\xe2\x80\x99t get here, the earth is moving into their path.\nLeonard: I can feel it. I can feel the earth moving. It\xe2\x80\x99s moving too fast. Raj, slow it down.\nRaj: Okay, how\xe2\x80\x99s that?\nLeonard: Better. Thanks.\nHoward: Stars are pretty, aren\xe2\x80\x99t they?\nLeonard: What\xe2\x80\x99s so funny?\nRaj: It\xe2\x80\x99s your American accent. Everything you say sounds stupid. (With an American accent) Stars are pretty, aren\xe2\x80\x99t they?\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s car.\nSheldon: For the record, I should let you know this is my first time driving an actual motor vehicle.\nPenny: You have your learner\xe2\x80\x99s permit, right?\nSheldon: Yes, and I have logged a considerable number of hours on a simulator.\nPenny: Good.\nSheldon: Didn\xe2\x80\x99t work out well.\nPenny: All right, can we please go?\nSheldon: One moment. According to my driver\xe2\x80\x99s ed book, a side mirror is properly adjusted when a portion of the is driver\xe2\x80\x99s door handle is visible in the lower right corner. There\xe2\x80\x99s the handle. Oh, no, too far, bringing it back. Optimized. Now, where is the switch to adjust the passenger side mirror?\nPenny: It\xe2\x80\x99s right there.\nSheldon: Where is the passenger side mirror?\nPenny: In a parking lot in Hollywood. Now, can we please go?\nSheldon: Yes. As soon as I adjust my seat. Whee! Oh, dear. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to have to start again.\nScene: The camp site.\n  Raj: If I could speak the language of rabbits, they would be amazed, and I would be their king.\nLeonard: I hate my name. It has nerd in it. Len nerd.\nHoward: I lost my virginity to my cousin Jeanie.\nRaj: I would be kind to my rabbit subjects. At first.\nLeonard: You know what\xe2\x80\x99s a cool name? Angelo. That has angel and jell-o in it.\nHoward: It was my Uncle Murray\xe2\x80\x99s funeral. We were all back at my Aunt Barbara\xe2\x80\x99s house. Our eyes locked over the pickled herring. We never meant for it to happen.\nRaj: One day, I hold a great ball for the President of France, but the rabbits, they hate me and don\xe2\x80\x99t come. I am embarrassed, so I eat all the lettuce in the world and make them watch.\nLeonard: People could call me Angie. Yo, Angie, how\xe2\x80\x99s it goin\xe2\x80\x99?\nHoward: To this day, I can\xe2\x80\x99t look at pickled herring without being aroused and ashamed. Oh, cousin Jeanie.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s car.\nPenny: Could you please drive a little faster?\nSheldon: Oh, I think we\xe2\x80\x99re going sufficiently fast. What\xe2\x80\x99s that?\nPenny: Nothing. The engine does that sometimes.\nSheldon: That can\xe2\x80\x99t be nothing, the check engine light is on. We need to find a service station.\nPenny: No. The light has been on since I bought the car.\nSheldon: All the more reason to consult with a mechanic before it explodes.\nPenny: It\xe2\x80\x99s not going to explode, just keep driving. Warp speed ahead, Mr. Spock.\nSheldon: Mr. Spock did not pilot the Enterprise. He was the science officer, and I guarantee you that if he ever saw the Enterprise\xe2\x80\x99s check engine light blinking, he would pull the ship over immediately.\nPenny: Oh, god, I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna lose the arm.\nSheldon: Oh, oh, red light, release accelerator and slowly apply the brake. Nailed it. While we have a moment, may I ask you a question?\nPenny: What?\nSheldon: Why do you have the Chinese character for soup tattooed on your right buttock?\nPenny: It\xe2\x80\x99s not soup, it\xe2\x80\x99s courage.\nSheldon: No, it isn\xe2\x80\x99t. But I suppose it does take courage to demonstrate that kind of commitment to soup.\nPenny: How did you see it? You said you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t look.\nSheldon: Sorry. As I told you, the hero always peeks.\nScene: The camp site.\nHoward: Anything?\nLeonard: No. That was the last pudding cup.\nHoward: No! What about Slim Jims?\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99s what he used to eat his pudding, remember?\nRaj: Right! That was so good! Sweety and meaty at the same time.\nHoward: Wait. Wait, wait. So you\xe2\x80\x99re saying we\xe2\x80\x99re out of food?\nLeonard: The only thing in here are blue ice packs.\nRaj: I know they\xe2\x80\x99re poison, but they look like big, yummy otter pops.\nLeonard: Oh, god, I am so hungry.\nHoward: Me too. Check and see if we have any more pudding.\nLeonard: Okay.\nScene: The hospital waiting room.\nSheldon: All right, there\xe2\x80\x99s no need to bark at me. According to the inexplicably irritable nurse behind the desk, you\xe2\x80\x99ll be seen after the man who claims to be having a heart attack, but appears to be well enough to play Doodle Jump on his iPhone. We have to fill these out. Describe illness or injury.\nPenny: I dislocated my shoulder.\nSheldon: All right. And how did the accident occur?\nPenny: You ready know that.\nSheldon: Cause of accident, lack of adhesive ducks. Okay, medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with diabetes?\nPenny: No.\nSheldon: Kidney disease?\nPenny: No.\nSheldon: Migraines?\nPenny: Getting one.\nSheldon: Are you currently pregnant?\nPenny: No.\nSheldon: Are you sure? You look a bit puffy.\nPenny: Change migraine to yes.\nSheldon: When was your last menstrual period?\nPenny: Oh, next question.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99ll put, in progress. Okay, moving to psychiatric disorders, list all major behavioural diagnoses, e.g. depression, anxiety, etcetera.\nPenny: Oh, my god, what the hell does this have to do with my stupid shoulder?\nSheldon: Episodes of sub psychotic rage.\nPenny: Ass.\nSheldon: Possible Tourette\xe2\x80\x99s. All right, moles, lesions or other skin conditions. Soup tattoo on right buttock.\nPenny: Hey, Sheldon, Sheldon, look, I am scared and in a lot of pain. Could you please just take a break from being you for just a minute and try being, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, comforting?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. There, there. Everything\xe2\x80\x99s going to be fine. Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s here.\nPenny: Thanks. That\xe2\x80\x99s much better.\nScene: The camp site.\nRaj: Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m so hungry!\nLeonard: Will you shut up? We\xe2\x80\x99re all hungry.\nHoward: Okay, our objective is the boy scout campsite to the east. Easy target. Big doughy scout master, couple of cubs, most webelos.\nLeonard: What kind of score are we looking at?\nHoward: Hot dogs, buns, s\xe2\x80\x99mores, I mean, it\xe2\x80\x99s a freaking 7-11.\nLeonard: All right, everyone grab flashlights.\nHoward: Oh, my god, could it be? Yes! My mother put an I love you brisket in my backpack.\nLeonard: Quick, get forks.\nHoward: You don\xe2\x80\x99t need forks. It\xe2\x80\x99s so tender, it falls apart in your hands.\nRaj: He\xe2\x80\x99s right.\nLeonard: I feel like we\xe2\x80\x99re forgetting something important.\nRaj: Me, too. But what? (Behind them, the meteor shower has begun)\nHoward: Maybe a tupperware bowl of roasted potatoes and carrots?\nLeonard and Raj together: Yes! Yes!\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nSheldon: Now remember, you were given powerful pain medication and a muscle relaxer, so, uh, don\xe2\x80\x99t operate heavy machinery. Try not to choke on your own drool.\nPenny: Wait. You have to help me get into bed. Sheldon has to get me into bed. Bet you never thought I\xe2\x80\x99d say that.\nSheldon: Yes. The charm of your drug addled candour knows no bounds.\nPenny: You know, people think you\xe2\x80\x99re this weird robot man who\xe2\x80\x99s so annoying all the time, and you totally are, but then it\xe2\x80\x99s like that movie Wall-E at the end. You\xe2\x80\x99re so full of love, and you can save a plant and get fat people out of the floaty chairs.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s a fairly laboured metaphor, but I appreciate the sentiment behind it.\nPenny: Sing \xe2\x80\x9cSoft Kitty\xe2\x80\x9d to me.\nSheldon: \xe2\x80\x9cSoft Kitty\xe2\x80\x9d is for when you\xe2\x80\x99re sick. You\xe2\x80\x99re not sick.\nPenny: Injured and drugged is a kind of sick.\nSheldon (singing): Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur\xe2\x80\xa6\nPenny: Wait, wait. Let\xe2\x80\x99s sing it as a round. I\xe2\x80\x99ll start. Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur\xe2\x80\xa6 See that\xe2\x80\x99s where you come in. I\xe2\x80\x99ll start over. Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur\xe2\x80\xa6 I\xe2\x80\x99ve got all night, Sheldon. Soft kitty, warm kitty\xe2\x80\xa6 (Sheldon joins in with the round) little ball of fur, happy kitty, sleepy kitty, purr, purr, purr.\nScene: The camp site. Raj is telling a ghost story with the torch on his face.\nRaj: \xe2\x80\xa6And the next morning when he woke up, he rolled over and realized\xe2\x80\xa6 duh-duh-duh! \xe2\x80\xa6she was his cousin.\nHoward: That\xe2\x80\x99s still not funny.\nRaj (imitating him): That\xe2\x80\x99s still not funny.\nHoward: And she was my second cousin.\nRaj (imitating him): And she was my second cousin.\nHoward: You\xe2\x80\x99re a real douche.\nRaj: Who cares? You slept with your cousin.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
