b'Scene: The apartment.\nPenny: Oh, I always tear up when the Grinch\xe2\x80\x99s heart grows three sizes.\nSheldon: Tears seem appropriate. Enlargement of the heart muscle, or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, is a serious disease which could lead to congestive heart failure.\nLeonard (singing Deck the Halls): Fa-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la.\nPenny: You really didn\xe2\x80\x99t like it, Sheldon?\nSheldon: No, on the contrary. I found the Grinch to be a relatable, engaging character, and I was really with him right up to the point that he succumbed to social convention and returned the presents and saved Christmas. What a buzz kill that was.\nLeonard: When we watch Frosty the Snowman, he roots for the sun.\nSheldon: Excuse me, but the sun is essential for all life on Earth. Frosty is merely a bit of frozen supernatural ephemera in a stolen hat. A crime, by the way, for which he is never brought to account.\nLeonard (continuing Deck the Halls): Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la.\nCredits sequence.\n  Scene: The apartment.\nPenny: I just love decorating the Christmas tree. It makes me feel like a little girl again.\nLeonard: We didn\xe2\x80\x99t have a tree when I was growing up.\nPenny: Really? Why not?\nLeonard: Mmm, in my family, holidays weren\xe2\x80\x99t so much celebrated as studied for their anthropological and psychological implications on human society.\nPenny: Oh, sounds festive. Did you at least give presents?\nLeonard: Mmm, in a way. We presented papers, and then broke off into focus groups and critiqued each other.\nPenny: Sheldon, what about you? Did you have a Christmas tree?\nSheldon: Oh, yes. We had a tree, we had a manger, we had an inflatable Santa Claus with plastic reindeer on the front lawn. And to make things even more jolly, there were so many blinking lights on the house they induced neighbourhood-wide seizures.\nPenny: So I take it you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to help us trim the tree.\nSheldon: I do not. But if you insist on decorating a spider-infested fire hazard in my home I would request that you add this.\nPenny: What is it?\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re kidding, right? It\xe2\x80\x99s a bust of Sir Isaac Newton.\nPenny: Oh, sure, sure, yeah. Very Christmassy.\nSheldon: Wait, excuse me, but it\xe2\x80\x99s much more Christmassy than anything you\xe2\x80\x99ve put on the tree.\nLeonard: Here we go.\nSheldon: December 25, 1642, Julian calendar, Sir Isaac Newton is born. Jesus, on the other hand, was actually born in the summer. His birthday was moved to coincide with a traditional pagan holiday that celebrated the winter solstice with lit fires and slaughtered goats. Which, frankly, sounds like more fun than 12 hours of church with my mother followed by a fruitcake.\nLeonard: Merry Newton-mas, everyone.\nSheldon: I sense that\xe2\x80\x99s not sincere, although I have no idea why.\nPenny: No, it\xe2\x80\x99s fine. Look, Sir Isaac can go right next to this little candy cane.\nSheldon: No. Isaac goes at the top of the tree.\nLeonard: No, he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t.\nSheldon: I understand. You dispute Newton\xe2\x80\x99s claim that he invented calculus and you want to put Gottfried Leibniz on the top.\nLeonard: Yeah, you got me. I\xe2\x80\x99m a Leibniz man.\nSheldon: Well, perhaps when your mother gets here, she\xe2\x80\x99ll talk some sense into you.\nPenny: What? Your\xe2\x80\xa6 your mother\xe2\x80\x99s coming? When?\nLeonard: Tomorrow.\nPenny: When were you going to tell me?\nLeonard: Um, tomorrow?\nPenny: Why were you keeping this a secret?\nLeonard: Well, I just, I thought\xe2\x80\xa6\nSheldon: If I can interject here, obviously Leonard is concerned that his mother won\xe2\x80\x99t approve of you as his mate.\nPenny: Why wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t she approve of me? I\xe2\x80\x99m adorable.\nLeonard: You are, it\xe2\x80\x99s just\xe2\x80\xa6\nSheldon: If I can interject again. Leonard comes from a remarkably high-achieving family, who have all chosen high-achieving partners. He probably feels that it\xe2\x80\x99s doubtful that his mother will be overly impressed with his dating a woman whose most significant achievement is memorizing the Cheesecake Factory menu.\nPenny: Hey, it\xe2\x80\x99s a big menu. There\xe2\x80\x99s two pages just for desserts.\nLeonard: I know. And those specials, they change every day.\nPenny: Okay, you know what? It\xe2\x80\x99s lame when I say it, it\xe2\x80\x99s just ridiculous when you pile on.\nLeonard: Okay, sorry.\nPenny: So what did she say when you told her we were going out?\nLeonard: Um\xe2\x80\xa6\nPenny: You didn\xe2\x80\x99t tell her we were going out, did you?\nLeonard: Um\xe2\x80\xa6\nPenny: Why not?\nLeonard: Um\xe2\x80\xa6\nSheldon: Leonard, I\xe2\x80\x99m no expert on meditation, but if you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to calm yourself down, I believe the word is Om.\nScene: Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s car.\nBeverley: It was so nice of you to come all the way down to the airport to pick me up.\nSheldon: No trouble at all.\nLeonard: I drove, Mother. I\xe2\x80\x99m driving now.\nBeverley: Yes, dear. Mommy\xe2\x80\x99s proud. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been meaning to thank you for your notes on my paper disproving quantum brain dynamic theory.\nSheldon: My pleasure. For a non-physicist, you have a remarkable grasp of how electric dipoles in the brain\xe2\x80\x99s water molecules could not possibly form a Bose condensate.\nLeonard: Wait, wait, wait. When did you send my mom notes on a paper?\nSheldon: August 16th. Right after her carpal tunnel surgery.\nBeverley: Oh, did I thank you for the flowers?\nSheldon: You did.\nBeverley: I don\xe2\x80\x99t really like flowers.\nSheldon: Neither do I, but it\xe2\x80\x99s the social convention.\nBeverley: It is, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\nLeonard: Wait, wait, wait. You had surgery?\nBeverley: Yes, and Sheldon sent me flowers.\nLeonard: No, I heard that.\nBeverley: Then what was all that wait, wait, wait about?\nLeonard: I just don\xe2\x80\x99t understand why he knows more about your life than I do.\nBeverley: Well, I would assume it\xe2\x80\x99s because Sheldon and I stay in touch due to mutual interest and respect, while you avoid me, due to unresolved childhood issues.\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s what we think caused your narcissistic personality disorder. We discussed it at length during our last video chat. Although how we got onto the subject of you is baffling.\nBeverley: Yes, but we are on the subject, so I\xe2\x80\x99m obliged to ask, Leonard, how are you?\nLeonard: Fine, Mom. How are you?\nBeverley: Mmm, menopausal.\nLeonard: Now I\xe2\x80\x99m less fine.\nBeverley: Have you heard your brother has gotten engaged?\nLeonard: No. Sheldon, why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you tell me?\nSheldon: My bad. I did send a gift from both of us.\nBeverley: She\xe2\x80\x99s a remarkable girl. The youngest appeals court judge in New Jersey and a two-time Olympic bronze medallist.\nLeonard: You must be very happy.\nBeverley: Why? I\xe2\x80\x99m not marrying her. So, how about you? Are you seeing anyone interesting?\nSheldon: Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure about interesting, but\xe2\x80\xa6\nLeonard: Not the time, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Very well. Shall we switch topics to Isaac Newton v. Gottfried Leibniz?\nBeverley: It\xe2\x80\x99s all right, Sheldon. I will just pretend that Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s not withholding information. Although, I will point out, Leonard, that I am a trained psychiatrist and you are exhibiting the same secretive behavioural tics that accompanied your learning to masturbate.\nSheldon: Isn\xe2\x80\x99t she brilliant, Leonard? How I envy you.\nScene: The apartment.\n  Beverley: So, Howard, have you and Rajesh finally summoned the courage to express your latent homosexual feelings toward one another?\nHoward: What? No.\nBeverley: Why not?\nHoward: Because we don\xe2\x80\x99t have latent homosexual feelings toward one another.\nBeverley: I see.\nHoward: No, really. I have a girlfriend now.\nBeverley: And where is she this evening?\nHoward: She had to go out of town. Her grandmother died.\nBeverley: I see. Her grandmother died.\nHoward: Honest to God. Leonard, tell her I have a girlfriend.\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about.\nHoward: What do you mean you don\xe2\x80\x99t know what I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about? Tell her I have a girlfriend!\nLeonard: All right. He \xe2\x80\x9chas\xe2\x80\x9d a \xe2\x80\x9cgirlfriend.\xe2\x80\x9d\nHoward: Her name is Bernadette, she\xe2\x80\x99s working as a waitress, but she\xe2\x80\x99s going to school to be a microbiologist.\nBeverley: Howard, keep in mind that the more passionately you stick to this construct, the more you\xe2\x80\x99re hurting your partner.\nHoward (to Raj who has whispered to him): Do you really think your lips in my ear is helping?\nPenny (arriving): Hi. Sorry I\xe2\x80\x99m late.\nLeonard: Oh, glad you\xe2\x80\x99re here, uh, sit down, I\xe2\x80\x99ll get you a plate. Mom, you remember Penny.\nBeverley: Oh, yes, the waitress slash actress with the unresolved father issues. Has he finally come to terms with his little slugger growing breasts?\nPenny: Well, he sent me a football and a catcher\xe2\x80\x99s mitt for Christmas, so I\xe2\x80\x99m going to say no.\nHoward: If it helps, we\xe2\x80\x99re all good with your breasts.\nBeverley: Classic overcompensation. Oh, speaking of fathers, Leonard, that reminds me, I\xe2\x80\x99m divorcing yours.\nLeonard: What?\nBeverley: Yes. He was cheating on me.\nLeonard: No!\nBeverley: Yes, with some waitress from the university cafeteria. Can you believe it? A waitress? Oh, no offense, dear.\nPenny: No, it sounded like a compliment.\nLeonard: When did this happen?\nBeverley: Mmm, well, let\xe2\x80\x99s see. Sheldon, when did I leave Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s father?\nSheldon: September 22nd.\nBeverley: Oh, yes, that\xe2\x80\x99s right. The weekend after Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s dog died.\nLeonard: Mitzy\xe2\x80\x99s dead?\nSheldon: She was old and blind, Leonard. What choice did we have?\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe this. Why am I the last to know?\nBeverley: Excuse me, Leonard, I am the one who\xe2\x80\x99s getting a divorce, Mitzy is the one who is dead. Why are you the one making a fuss?\nLeonard: You\xe2\x80\x99re right. I\xe2\x80\x99m-I\xe2\x80\x99m-I\xe2\x80\x99m-I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, I\xe2\x80\x99m way out of line!\nBeverley: So, Penny, what\xe2\x80\x99s new in your life?\nPenny: Nothing. Not a damn thing.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s car.\nBeverley: Thank you for driving me back to my hotel.\nPenny: Oh, it\xe2\x80\x99s not a problem.\nBeverley: I was going to ask Leonard to do it, but he seemed a bit emotionally unstable and you don\xe2\x80\x99t want someone like that operating heavy machinery.\nPenny: No, you do not.\nBeverley: Your check engine light is on.\nPenny: Yeah, I gotta put a sticker over that. So, uh, you must be devastated about your divorce.\nBeverley: Oh, not at all. But I am a bit distressed to be in a vehicle that\xe2\x80\x99s not subjected to regular maintenance.\nPenny: Come on, I mean, you\xe2\x80\x99re not upset that your marriage is over?\nBeverley: Well, initially I felt something akin to grief and perhaps anger, but that\xe2\x80\x99s the natural reaction of the limbic system to being betrayed by a loathsome son of a bitch.\nPenny: Sure, sure.\nBeverley: Thankfully, my shock was somewhat mitigated by the fact that I haven\xe2\x80\x99t had intercourse with him in eight years.\nPenny: Eight years?\nBeverley: Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s nothing. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been responsible for my own orgasms since 1982.\nPenny: Yikes. What\xe2\x80\x99s so funny?\nBeverley: That\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what I say during orgasms. Yikes.\nPenny: You know what? I could use a drink. Do you want to stop for a drink?\nBeverley: Oh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t drink.\nPenny: I do, I\xe2\x80\x99ll teach you.\nScene: Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom.\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard? (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard? (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard?\nLeonard: What is it?\nSheldon: I made tea.\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t want tea.\nSheldon: I didn\xe2\x80\x99t make tea for you. This is my tea.\nLeonard: Then why are you telling me?\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s a conversation starter.\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99s a lousy conversation starter.\nSheldon: Oh, is it? We\xe2\x80\x99re conversing. Checkmate.\nLeonard: What do you want, Sheldon?\nSheldon: What I want is to be departing the Starship Enterprise in a one-man shuttle craft headed to the planetoid I rule known as Sheldon Alpha Five.\nLeonard: I want that too. Why are you here?\nSheldon: To comfort you, of course. No, that\xe2\x80\x99s not going to work at all, I\xe2\x80\x99ll comfort you from over here. Leonard, what you\xe2\x80\x99re experiencing is a classic Jungian crisis in which the aging individual mourns the loss of the never-to-be realized ideal family unit.\nLeonard: Thank you, that\xe2\x80\x99s very comforting.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s not the comforting part.\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s not?\nSheldon: No, no. The comforting part is that the Germans have a term for what you\xe2\x80\x99re feeling. Weltschmerz. It means the depression that arises from comparing the world as it is to a hypothetical, idealized world.\nLeonard: You\xe2\x80\x99re right, I do feel better.\nSheldon: Well, the Germans have always been a comforting people. Just remember, Leonard, where your biological family has failed you, you always have me, your surrogate family.\nLeonard: You\xe2\x80\x99re my surrogate family?\nSheldon: If it\xe2\x80\x99s any consolation, I\xe2\x80\x99m not happy about it either. Good night.\nScene: A bar.\n  Penny: Okay, now this time try drinking it all at once.\nBeverley: Yikes.\nPenny: I\xe2\x80\x99ve been responsible for my own buzz since 2003. Another round for me and my homegirl.\nBeverley: I feel a spreading warmth through my extremities.\nPenny: As long as you don\xe2\x80\x99t feel it running down your pants, you\xe2\x80\x99re fine.\nBeverley: Oh, that is fascinating. I\xe2\x80\x99m noticing an immediate lowering of my inhibitions. For example, I\xe2\x80\x99m seriously considering asking that busboy to ravish me in the alleyway while I eat cheesecake. What do you think?\nPenny: Well, we are known for our cheesecake. Hit us again.\nBeverley: Yes. If a little is good, more must be better.\nPenny: Hey, Bev, guess what?\nBeverley: What?\nPenny: I\xe2\x80\x99m sleeping with your son.\nBeverley: Really? Which one?\nPenny: The one from whom I live across the hall from.\nBeverley: Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s convenient. How did his penis turn out?\nPenny: Oh, Beverly, I can\xe2\x80\x99t talk to my boyfriend\xe2\x80\x99s mother about his penis.\nBeverley: Oh, fair enough. What can you tell me, if anything, about that busboy\xe2\x80\x99s penis?\nPenny: Actually, I\xe2\x80\x99ve only had the cheesecake. One more time. You know, Leonard did not want to tell you we were dating.\nBeverley: Really? Well, that means he\xe2\x80\x99s either embarrassed about the relationship or he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t care enough about his mother to tell her he\xe2\x80\x99s in one. Either way, one of us should be insulted.\nPenny: Well, let\xe2\x80\x99s go find out who.\nBeverley: You go get a taxi. I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna slip my business card into that busboy\xe2\x80\x99s back pocket, cupping his firm, right buttock as I do so.\nScene: The apartment.\nPenny: Leonard?\nBeverley: Sonny boy!\nPenny: Get out here! Your mommy wants to talk to you!\nLeonard: What the hell is going on?\nPenny: You\xe2\x80\x99re in trouble.\nBeverley: Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you tell me you were tapping my homegirl? Did I say that right?\nPenny: Yeah, not bad, not bad.\nLeonard: Are you guys drunk?\nBeverley: Well, I hope so. Otherwise, why would we have stopped at Del Taco? Now, how could you not tell me you were in a relationship with this lovely, charming young woman?\nPenny: Oh, thank you.\nBeverley: You\xe2\x80\x99re welcome. Is it because she\xe2\x80\x99s uneducated, trapped in a menial service position?\nPenny: What the hell happened to lovely and charming?\nLeonard: How come you didn\xe2\x80\x99t tell me that you and Father were getting a divorce? How come you didn\xe2\x80\x99t tell me you had surgery? How come you didn\xe2\x80\x99t tell me my dog died?\nBeverley: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. What I hear you saying is that you want a more intimate mother-son relationship.\nLeonard: I do.\nBeverley (gives him an uncomfortable hug): There. It\xe2\x80\x99s late. Now, go to bed. I\xe2\x80\x99m getting a warm feeling spreading through my heart.\nPenny: That\xe2\x80\x99s the Del Taco.\nSheldon: Why is Leonard softly banging his head against his bedroom door?\nBeverley: Speaking of warm feelings, come here. (She grabs Sheldon and kisses him) No, I\xe2\x80\x99d rather have the busboy.\nScene: Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s car.\nBeverley: Thank you for taking me to the airport.\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re very welcome.\nLeonard: Once again, I\xe2\x80\x99m driving. I\xe2\x80\x99m right here.\nBeverley: Please, I am very hungover and in no mood to satisfy your need for approval. Sheldon, I do hope you\xe2\x80\x99ll forgive me for my inappropriate behaviour last night.\nSheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t blame you. You were intoxicated.\nBeverley: Thank you.\nSheldon: I blame Penny.\nPenny: I blame Penny, too. Bad Penny.\nLeonard: Wait a minute, what are you talking about? What inappropriate behaviour?\nBeverley: I think it\xe2\x80\x99s best that you not know.\nSheldon: Agreed.\nPenny: Agreed.\nLeonard: What the hell, agreed.\nBeverley: And I want you to take very good care of this young woman.\nPenny: Oh, thank you, Beverly.\nBeverley: You\xe2\x80\x99re welcome. She doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have much in the way of career prospects, don\xe2\x80\x99t make her responsible for her own orgasms as well.\nLeonard: Mother, remember when I was complaining that you don\xe2\x80\x99t communicate with me enough?\nBeverley: Yes, dear.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m over it.\nPenny (finishing Deck the Halls): Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la la-la.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
