b'Scene: The university cafeteria.\nSheldon: Your argument is lacking in all scientific merit. It is well established Superman cleans his uniform by flying into Earth\xe2\x80\x99s yellow sun, which incinerates any contaminate matter and leaves the invulnerable Kryptonian fabric unharmed and daisy fresh.\nHoward: What if he gets something Kryptonian on it?\nSheldon: Like what?\nHoward: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Kryptonian mustard.\nSheldon: I think we can safely assume that all Kryptonian condiments were destroyed when the planet Krypton exploded.\nRaj: Or it turned into mustard Kryptonite, the only way to destroy a rogue Kryptonian hotdog threatening Earth.\nLeonard: Raj, please, let\xe2\x80\x99s stay serious here. Superman\xe2\x80\x99s body is Kryptonian, therefore his sweat is Kryptonian.\nHoward: Yeah, what about Kryptonian pit stains?\nSheldon: Superman doesn\xe2\x80\x99t sweat on Earth.\nHoward: Okay, he\xe2\x80\x99s invited for dinner in the Bottle City of Kandor. He miniaturizes himself, enters the city where he loses his superpowers. Now, before dinner, his host says, \xe2\x80\x9cwho\xe2\x80\x99s up for a little Kryptonian tetherball?\xe2\x80\x9d Superman says \xe2\x80\x9csure,\xe2\x80\x9d works up a sweat, comes back to Earth, his uniform now stained with indestructible Kryptonian perspiration.\nRaj: Booya.\nSheldon: Superman would have taken his uniform to a Kandorian dry cleaner before he left the Bottle.\nRaj: \xe2\x80\x9cKandorian dry cl\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d I give up, you can\xe2\x80\x99t have a rational argument with this man.\nHoward: Hey, isn\xe2\x80\x99t that the guy who won the MacArthur genius grant last year? No, not all at once.\nRaj: Then how?\nHoward: Leonard. Now, Raj. Now, Sheldon.\nRaj: I didn\xe2\x80\x99t get a good look. Can I go again?\nHoward: No.\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s David Underhill. So what?\nSheldon: So what? His observation of high-energy positrons has provided the first conclusive evidence for the existence of galactic dark matter.\nLeonard: I have two words for you. The first is big, the other\xe2\x80\x99s whoop.\nSheldon: It is a big whoop. It made almost all the work you\xe2\x80\x99ve done since you\xe2\x80\x99ve been here completely useless.\nLeonard: Did not.\nHoward: Did, too.\nLeonard: Did\xe2\x80\xa6 okay, maybe  some of it, but, look, the guy was just in the right place, at the right time with the right paradigm-shifting reinterpretation of the universe. He got lucky.\nRaj: In more ways than one. He\xe2\x80\x99s a very handsome man.\nHoward: Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t do anything for me. If I was gonna go that way, I\xe2\x80\x99m more of a Zac Ephron kinda guy.\nRaj: Oh, yeah, like you have a shot with Zac Ephron.\nDavid (approaching): Excuse me, Are you Leonard Hofstadter?\nLeonard: Uh, yeah.\nDavid: I\xe2\x80\x99m David Underhill.\nLeonard: Uh, y-yeah.\nDavid: Yeah, Dr. Gablehauser said if I wanted to set something up in the photomultiplier lab, that you\xe2\x80\x99d be able to give me a hand?\nLeonard: You want to work with me?\nDavid: Well, if you have a little time, yeah.\nLeonard: Wow, y-yeah, sure. Yeah, no problem. Uh, Here\xe2\x80\x99s my home number, here\xe2\x80\x99s my cell, here\xe2\x80\x99s my office, here\xe2\x80\x99s my parents\xe2\x80\x99 number up in New Jersey, they always know how to reach me. So\xe2\x80\xa6\nDavid: Okay.\nLeonard: Congratulations on the MacArthur Grant, by the way. Big fan.\nDavid: Thanks. I\xe2\x80\x99ll call you.\nLeonard: Okay. Bye-bye! What are you looking at?You\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen a hypocrite before?\nCredits sequence.\n  Scene: The apartment. The guys are playing Wii bowling.\nRaj: Trailing badly, Wolowitz needs a strike if he has any hopes of catching up with Sheldon Cooper, who is dominating in the ninth frame with a career-best 68.\nLeonard (entering): Hey, guys!\nHoward: That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t count. Do over! Do over!\nSheldon: There are no do-overs in Wii bowling.\nHoward: There are always do-overs when my people play sports.\nSheldon: Where were you that\xe2\x80\x99s more important than Wii bowling night?\nLeonard: Actually, I was\xe2\x80\xa6\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s a rhetorical question. There is nothing more important than Wii bowling night.\nLeonard: Come on, it\xe2\x80\x99s just a video game. And we suck at it.\nSheldon: Nice motivational speech from the team captain.\nHoward: Where were you?\nLeonard: I was working with Dave Underhill.\nHoward: Ooh, \xe2\x80\x9cDave.\xe2\x80\x9d Sounds like Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s got a new BFF.\nLeonard: Actually, he\xe2\x80\x99s pretty cool. I mean, not only is he a brilliant scientist, but it turns out he\xe2\x80\x99s a Black Diamond skier, he collects vintage motorcycles, he plays in a rock band.\nHoward: So? We\xe2\x80\x99re in a rock band.\nLeonard: No, we play Rock Band on our X-Box.\nSheldon: Nice motivational speech from our lead guitarist.\nLeonard: He\xe2\x80\x99s funny, too. He does this hysterical impersonation of Stephen Hawking having phone sex. What are you wearing? That\xe2\x80\x99s not, he does it better. Anyway, he said he was gonna take me to the gym tomorrow, so I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna go practice my situps.\nRaj: Whoa. Humongous man crush, dude.\nHoward: Yep. It\xe2\x80\x99s officially a bro-mance.\nPenny (entering): Hey, Sheldon, are you and Leonard putting up a Christmas tree?\nSheldon: No, because we don\xe2\x80\x99t celebrate the ancient pagan festival of Saturnalia.\nPenny: Saturnalia?\nHoward: Gather round, kids, it\xe2\x80\x99s time for Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s beloved Christmas special.\nSheldon: In the pre-Christian era, as the winter solstice approached and the plants died, pagans brought evergreen boughs into their homes as an act of sympathetic magic, intended to guard the life essences of the plants until spring. This custom was later appropriated by Northern Europeans and eventually it becomes the so-called Christmas tree.\nHoward: And that, Charlie Brown, is what boredom is all about.\nPenny: Okay, well, thank you for that, but I got you and Leonard a few silly neighbour gifts, so I\xe2\x80\x99ll just put them under my tree.\nSheldon: Wait! You bought me a present?\nPenny: Uh-huh.\nSheldon: Why would you do such a thing?\nPenny: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. \xe2\x80\x98Cause it\xe2\x80\x99s Christmas?\nSheldon: Oh, Penny. I know you think you\xe2\x80\x99re being generous, but the foundation of gift-giving is reciprocity. You haven\xe2\x80\x99t given me a gift, you\xe2\x80\x99ve given me an obligation.\nHoward: Don\xe2\x80\x99t feel bad, Penny, it\xe2\x80\x99s a classic rookie mistake. My first Hanukkah with Sheldon, he yelled at me for eight nights.\nPenny: Now, honey, it\xe2\x80\x99s okay.You don\xe2\x80\x99t have to get me anything in return.\nSheldon: Of course I do. The essence of the custom is that I now have to go out and purchase for you a gift of commensurate value and representing the same perceived level of friendship as that represented by the gift you\xe2\x80\x99ve given me. It\xe2\x80\x99s no wonder suicide rates skyrocket this time of year.\nPenny: Okay, you know what? Forget it. I\xe2\x80\x99m not giving you a present.\nSheldon: No, it\xe2\x80\x99s too late. I see it. That elf sticker says to Sheldon. The die has been cast, the moving finger has writ, Hannibal has crossed the Alps.\nHoward (to Raj who is whispering in his ear): I know. It\xe2\x80\x99s funny when it\xe2\x80\x99s not happening to us.\nPenny: Sheldon, I am very, very sorry.\nSheldon: No. No, I brought this on myself by being such an endearing and important part of your life. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to need a ride to the mall.\nHoward: It\xe2\x80\x99s happening to us.\nScene: The stairwell.\nLeonard: Ow! Ow!\nDavid: Are you gonna make it?\nLeonard: Yeah, I guess.\nDavid: All right.\nLeonard: Thanks for letting me try out your motorcycle.\nDavid: No problem.\nLeonard: I had no idea it was so heavy. The thing just fell right over on me, didn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\nDavid: Yeah. Lucky for you it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t moving.\nPenny: Oh, hey, Leonard. Ooh, are you okay?\nLeonard: Oh, yeah. It\xe2\x80\x99s just a little motorcycle accident.\nPenny: My God, how fast were you going?\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. It\xe2\x80\x99s all such a blur.\nDavid: Ha ha ha. Good one. He couldn\xe2\x80\x99t even get it started. Hi. Dave.\nPenny: Hi. Penny. So it\xe2\x80\x99s your motorcycle?\nDavid: Uh-huh.\nPenny: Oh, is it okay?\nDavid: It\xe2\x80\x99s fine.\nLeonard: Yeah, lucky for the bike it landed on my leg.\nDavid: You mind giving me a hand with speed racer here?\nPenny: Oh, yeah. Yeah, sure. So, um, Dave, how do you know Leonard?\nDavid: I\xe2\x80\x99m a physicist.\nPenny: Ha-ha. No, you\xe2\x80\x99re not.\nDavid: Why is that so surprising?\nPenny: Uh, well, it\xe2\x80\x99s just that the physicists I know are indoorsy and pale.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m not indoorsy. I just wear the appropriate sun block because I don\xe2\x80\x99t take melanoma lightly.\nPenny: So, are you and Leonard working on an experiment together?\nDavid: Yeah, actually we are.\nLeonard: Yeah, we\xe2\x80\x99re examining the radiation levels of photomultiplier tubes for a new dark matter detector.\nPenny: Uh, sweetie, sweetie, Dave was talking. You know, I love science.\nLeonard: Since when?\nPenny: Since always. Call me a geek, but I am just nuts for the whole subatomic particle thing.\nDavid: The last thing I would ever call you is a geek.\nPenny: Ha. Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s what I am, queen of the nerds.\nDavid: Well, if you like, I could show you the lab we\xe2\x80\x99re working in. We\xe2\x80\x99ve got some cool toys, you know, lasers and stuff.\nPenny: You know, I have always wanted to see a big science lab.\nLeonard: Since when?\nPenny: Since always.\nDavid: Leonard, are you okay here?\nLeonard: Uh, yeah. I guess.\nDavid: How \xe2\x80\x99bout we go see it now? Maybe afterwards we take the bike up the coast, we grab a little bite to eat\xe2\x80\xa6\nPenny: Um,yeah, yeah, that sounds great, let me just get my jacket.\nDavid: Boy, she\xe2\x80\x99ll do, huh?\nLeonard: Yeah, if you like that type.\nDavid: So, you and her?\nLeonard: No, just neighbours.\nDavid: Really. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how you live next door to that without doing something about it.\nLeonard: Actually, science is my lady.\nPenny: Okay. Let\xe2\x80\x99s go.\nDavid: All right. See you tomorrow, Leonard.\nLeonard: See ya. \xe2\x80\x98Bye, Penny. Have fun. (Bangs head on door. Sheldon opens it.)\nSheldon: Yes? (Leonard falls through) Did you forget your key?\nScene: A gift shop.\n  Sheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t see anything in here a woman would want.\nHoward: You\xe2\x80\x99re kidding. You\xe2\x80\x99ve got lotions and bath oils and soaps, that\xe2\x80\x99s the estrogen hat trick.\nLeonard: What it is is a cacophonous assault of eucalyptus, bayberry, cinnamon and vanilla. It\xe2\x80\x99s as if my head were trapped in the pyjamas of a sultan.\nRaj: Sheldon, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t like this stuff, let\xe2\x80\x99s just go next door and build her a bear.\nSheldon: I told you before, bears are terrifying.\nHoward: Come on, bath stuff, it\xe2\x80\x99s perfect! You got a scented candle, a cleansing buff, spearmint and green tea scented bath oil, promotes relaxation.\nSheldon: That presupposes Penny is tense.\nRaj: She knows you. She\xe2\x80\x99s tense. We all are. Buy a basket!\nHoward: Excuse me, we\xe2\x80\x99re ready.\nSheldon: No, we\xe2\x80\x99re not. Let\xe2\x80\x99s say for a moment that I accept the bath item gift hypothesis, I now lay the following conundrum at your feet, which size?\nHoward: This one. Let\xe2\x80\x99s go.\nSheldon: You put no thought into that.\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. Uh, this one. Let\xe2\x80\x99s go!\nSheldon: I have insufficient data to proceed. Excuse me, miss?\nAssistant: Yes?\nSheldon: If I were to give you this gift basket, based on that action alone and no other data, infer and describe the hypothetical relationship that exists between us.\nAssistant: Excuse me?\nSheldon: Here. Now, are we friends? Colleagues? Lovers? Are you my grandmother?\nAssistant: I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand what you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about and you\xe2\x80\x99re making me a little uncomfortable.\nHoward: See? Sounds just like you and Penny. We\xe2\x80\x99ll take it.\nScene: The university cafeteria.\nDavid: Hey, Leonard. Come, join us.\nLeonard: Oh, hey, Dave. And Penny, what a surprise.\nPenny: Hey, Leonard. Dave was just showing me around the university. You know, this place is unbelievable!\nLeonard: Yeah, I know. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been offering to show you around for a year and a half. You always said you had yoga.\nPenny: I never said that.\nLeonard: Maybe I heard you wrong. A lot of words sound like yoga.\nDavid: This is an amazing woman, Leonard. She has a curious and agile mind, not to mention being curious and agile in other respects.\nPenny: Oh, shut up!\nLeonard: Yes, please shut up. So, um, Dave, don\xe2\x80\x99t you think you and I should get back to the lab? You know, that dark matter isn\xe2\x80\x99t going to detect itself.\nDavid: Actually, I was thinking about taking the afternoon off so I could work on another experiment with Penny.\nPenny: Really? We\xe2\x80\x99re going to do an experiment?\nDavid: Uh-huh. We\xe2\x80\x99re going to explore the effects of tequila shots on a gorgeous 22-year-old woman.\nPenny: It\xe2\x80\x99s not an experiment! You saw what happened last night.\nDavid: You ready to go?\nPenny: Yeah. Oh, can I drive the motorcycle?\nDavid: Yeah, why not? You can\xe2\x80\x99t do any worse than Leonard.\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99s funny. By the way, my leg is killing me. Thanks for asking.\nScene: The apartment.\n  Sheldon: Mmm, great news, Leonard, I\xe2\x80\x99ve solved my Penny gift dilemma.\nLeonard: Yippee.\nSheldon: You see, the danger was that I might under or over-reciprocate, but I have devised a foolproof plan. See, I will open her gift to me first and then excuse myself, feigning digestive distress.\nThen I\xe2\x80\x99ll look up the price of her gift online, choose the basket closest to that value, give it to her and then I\xe2\x80\x99ll return the others for a full refund.\nLeonard: Brilliant.\nSheldon: It is, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? Is it okay if I hide them in your room? The smell makes me nauseated.\nLeonard: Do whatever you want.\nSheldon: Thank you, that\xe2\x80\x99s very gracious.     Gentlemen.\nHoward: Why couldn\xe2\x80\x99t you have just done what Leonard did and get Penny a new boyfriend?\nLeonard: My leg is killing me. Thanks for asking.\n  Scene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\n  Leonard: Okay, I have just one question for you. While I am perfectly happy with the way things are between us, you said that you didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to go out with me because I was too smart for you! Well, news flash, lady, David Underhill is ten times smarter than me! You\xe2\x80\x99d have to drive a railroad spike into his brain for me to beat him at checkers! Next to him, I\xe2\x80\x99m like one of those sign-language gorillas who knows how to ask for grapes! So, my question is, what\xe2\x80\x99s up with that?\nPenny: Why are you yelling at me?\nLeonard: Sorry, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry! Never mind, we\xe2\x80\x99re cool.\nPenny: Dave is not smarter than you. He\xe2\x80\x99s an idiot.\nLeonard: Really? Why would you say that?\nPenny: Because a smart guy takes the nude photos of his wife off his cell phone before he tries to take nude photos of his girlfriend.\nLeonard: He tried to take nude photos of you?\nPenny: That\xe2\x80\x99s what you took from that? The guy is married!\nLeonard: Oh, yeah. I\xe2\x80\x99m so\xe2\x80\xa6 oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s terrible.\nPenny: And you, if you are so okay with the way things are between us, why are you so jealous?\nLeonard: Well, uh, the important thing is he\xe2\x80\x99s married and that\xe2\x80\x99s terrible!\nPenny: Nice save, genius. Eggnog?\nLeonard: Lactose.\nPenny: It\xe2\x80\x99s just rum. It stopped being eggnog like half an hour ago.\nLeonard: Smooth.\nPenny: Smoother than you.\nLeonard: Come on, it\xe2\x80\x99s Christmas, just give me this one.\nPenny: Okay, Merry Christmas.\nLeonard: By the way, my leg is killing me. Thanks for asking.\nScene: The apartment. Leonard opens the door to Penny.\nPenny: Merry Christmas.\nLeonard: Merry Christmas.\nPenny: How\xe2\x80\x99s your leg?\nLeonard: Very good, thanks for asking. Come on in.\nSheldon: Ah, good, Penny, you\xe2\x80\x99re here to exchange gifts. You\xe2\x80\x99ll be pleased to know I\xe2\x80\x99m prepared for whatever you have to offer.\nPenny: Okay, here.\nSheldon: I should note I\xe2\x80\x99m having some digestive distress, so, if I excuse myself abruptly, don\xe2\x80\x99t be alarmed. Oh, a napkin.\nPenny: Turn it over.\nSheldon: To Sheldon, live long and prosper. Leonard Nimoy.\nPenny: Yeah, he came into the restaurant. Sorry the napkin\xe2\x80\x99s dirty. He wiped his mouth with it.\nSheldon: I possess the DNA of Leonard Nimoy?!\nPenny: Well, yeah, yeah, I guess. But look, he signed it.\nSheldon: Do you realize what this means? All I need is a healthy ovum and I can grow my own Leonard Nimoy!\nPenny: Okay, all I\xe2\x80\x99m giving you is the napkin, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Be right back.\nPenny: Here. Open it.\nLeonard: Oh, a gift certificate for motorcycle lessons. Very thoughtful.\nPenny: Yeah, and I checked. Not letting the bike fall on you while standing still is lesson one.\nLeonard: Oh, then, I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll appreciate what I got you.\nPenny: Okay. 101 Totally Cool Science Experiments for Kids.\nLeonard: You know, \xe2\x80\x99cause you\xe2\x80\x99re so into science.\n(Sheldon appears with all the gift baskets)\nPenny: Sheldon! What did you do?!\nSheldon: I know! It\xe2\x80\x99s not enough, is it? Here.\nPenny: Leonard, look! Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s hugging me.\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s a Saturnalia miracle.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
