b'Scene: The Apartment.\nLeonard: How\xe2\x80\x99s your mom holding up?\nHoward: She\xe2\x80\x99s doing okay, but we just lost another nurse.\nAmy: How many is that now?\nHoward: Two, and I know what you\xe2\x80\x99re thinking, she\xe2\x80\x99s eating them.\nBernadette: She\xe2\x80\x99s just so impossible, they keep quitting.\nSheldon: So, who\xe2\x80\x99s watching her now?\nHoward: A bowl full of M&M\xe2\x80\x99s with a few Ambien tossed in.\nRaj: What up, guys?\nAll: Hello, hey!\nLeonard: Okay. Well, now that everyone\xe2\x80\x99s here, Penny and I have some big news. We\xe2\x80\x99re engaged.\nGeneral cheering and congratulations.\nRaj: And I thought me having sex with Emily was gonna be the big news.\nGeneral cheering and congratulations.\nLeonard: Hey, hey, what the hell?\nBernadette: You guys propose all the time. This never happens.\nPenny: You\xe2\x80\x99re right! Yay!\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The cafeteria.\nRaj: Boy, I\xe2\x80\x99m so hungry today. I wonder why?\nHoward: Because you had sex the other night?\nRaj: You know what? That may be it. By the way, it isn\xe2\x80\x99t like riding a bike. Like, I fell off a few times.\nLeonard: Hey, buddy.\nSheldon: Hello.\nLeonard: You okay?\nSheldon: I just got called into President Siebert\xe2\x80\x99s office. The university won\xe2\x80\x99t let me switch my field of study to inflationary cosmology. They\xe2\x80\x99re forcing me to continue with string theory.\nHoward: Why?\nSheldon: He said it\xe2\x80\x99s why they hired me, it\xe2\x80\x99s, it\xe2\x80\x99s what my grant was designated for, and that everybody has to do things they don\xe2\x80\x99t want to do. He then gave an example of something he had to do, even though he didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to, which was look at my stupid face.\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99s a rude thing to say, out loud.\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s an outrage. Honestly, I\xe2\x80\x99m tempted to leave the university.\nHoward: You know, if you\xe2\x80\x99re really serious about that, I hear there are some exciting opportunities in home care for the old and fat.\nLeonard: Whatever you do, just don\xe2\x80\x99t make any rash decisions.\nSheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I am really aggravated.\nRaj: When I\xe2\x80\x99m feeling low, I have sex with a girl. But that\xe2\x80\x99s just me.\nScene: Mrs Wolowitz\xe2\x80\x99s house.\nHoward: Oh, come on, give her a chance.\nNurse: No. Life, it is too short.\nBernadette: I know you\xe2\x80\x99ve only been here a day and a half, but you\xe2\x80\x99re like part of the family. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think the service is gonna send any more people.\nHoward: Yeah, maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s time we just release Ma back into the sea.\nBernadette: That\xe2\x80\x99s not helpful.\nHoward: Well, then, we may need to get used to the idea that we\xe2\x80\x99re gonna be living here the next few months.\nBernadette: But we have jobs. We can\xe2\x80\x99t baby-sit her 24 hours a day.\nHoward: Well, what if we use our vacation time?\nBernadette: I wanted to go to Hawaii, not hell.\nHoward: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what else we can do.\nBernadette: Howie, I love you, and as your wife, your mother is every bit as much my problem as she is yours, so, I want a divorce.\nScene: The apartment.\nMrs Hofstadter (on webcam): Hello, Leonard.\nLeonard: Hi, Mom. I have some exciting news.\nMrs Hofstadter: I\xe2\x80\x99m listening.\nLeonard: Before I tell you, will you promise to try and be happy for me and keep any concerns you have to yourself?\nMrs Hofstadter: No. Let me save you all of your hemming and hawing. Sheldon already told me that you and Penny are engaged.\nLeonard: I hate that you talk to him more than you talk to me.\nMrs Hofstadter: Would you like for you and me to talk more?\nLeonard: You know what? It\xe2\x80\x99s probably fine.\nMrs Hofstadter: In any event, while I\xe2\x80\x99ve had my misgivings about Penny, Sheldon spoke very fondly of her, and if she is good enough for him, then she\xe2\x80\x99s good enough for me.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m your son. What about the fact that she\xe2\x80\x99s good enough for me?\nMrs Hofstadter: Sure.\nLeonard: Thanks, Mom.\nMrs Hofstadter: Leonard, would it make you feel better to hear that your mother approved of your life choices?\nLeonard: Yes, it would.\nMrs Hofstadter: Yeah. Well, you should work on that.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nPenny (on phone): No, Mom, it\xe2\x80\x99s the same guy I\xe2\x80\x99ve been going out with for the past two years. Yeah, the scientist. Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s complicated. I mean, he works with lasers and atomic magnets. No, I did not see it coming. No, we did not set a date. No, I am not pregnant. Yeah, this is a first for our family. All right, tell Dad I love him. I gotta go. All right, bye.\nAmy: Atomic magnets?\nPenny: Shut up.\nBernadette: Sorry I\xe2\x80\x99m late. The leaf blower broke, so I had to hand-dry my mother-in-law.\nPenny: You want some wine?\nBernadette: Thanks. Little warning before you jump into this marriage business. You\xe2\x80\x99re not just marrying him, you\xe2\x80\x99re marrying his family.\nPenny: I think Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s mom\xe2\x80\x99s okay with me.\nBernadette: It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter if she\xe2\x80\x99s okay with you. The question is, can she go to the bathroom by herself? Hit me again.\nAmy: So, what are the living arrangements gonna be?\nPenny: Well, haven\xe2\x80\x99t really talked about it yet, but I figure at some point, I\xe2\x80\x99ll move in with him, or he\xe2\x80\x99ll move in with me.\nAmy: Well, with you not working, that makes financial sense.\nBernadette: You\xe2\x80\x99re not working. How would you like a job in home health care?\nPenny: Not a chance.\nBernadette: Please. I\xe2\x80\x99m desperate.\nPenny: No.\nBernadette: I\xe2\x80\x99ll pay you anything you want.\nPenny: Okay, then, yeah.\nScene: Mrs Wolowitz\xe2\x80\x99s house.\nPenny: No, keep your money.\nBernadette: I could\xe2\x80\x99ve ridden a bull longer than that.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: What you working on?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m writing an appeal to the Faculty Senate, so that I can move on from string theory.\nLeonard: Oh. How\xe2\x80\x99s it going?\nSheldon: You tell me. Dear Esteemed Colleagues, as you may know, I have requested to change my field of study. My decision to do so is, I believe, in the best interest of science. At your convenience, I\xe2\x80\x99d be happy to explain it to you in words you\xe2\x80\x99ll understand.\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s nice that you called them esteemed.\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re right. I\xe2\x80\x99ll take that out.\nLeonard: So, listen, there was something I was hoping to float past you.\nSheldon: Mm.\nLeonard: Now that Penny and I are engaged, I thought we might want to talk about our living arrangements.\nSheldon: Of course. She\xe2\x80\x99s spent many nights here, and you\xe2\x80\x99re worried about preserving the myth of her virginity before the wedding.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m not.\nSheldon: Good, because not only has that ship sailed, if it hit an iceberg, countless men would perish.\nLeonard: Actually, this is about where she and I are going to live.\nSheldon: What do you mean?\nLeonard: Well, well, we might want to live together.\nSheldon: Oh, yeah, well, I\xe2\x80\x99ve already given this some thought, and I\xe2\x80\x99m willing to let Penny live with us one day a week for a trial period. Now, obviously, not when she\xe2\x80\x99s made cranky by the shedding of her uterine lining.\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99s very sweet. But we were thinking more of us maybe living together with\xe2\x80\xa6 not you.\nSheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand. How could we all live together if I\xe2\x80\x99m not there?\nLeonard: Look, I, I know this is, this is change, and that sounds scary.\nSheldon: Where are you going to go?\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. We just started to think about this. Maybe I\xe2\x80\x99ll move in with Penny, or maybe she and I\xe2\x80\x99ll take this place, and you can move across the hall.\nSheldon: Move across the hall? Did you take a marijuana?\nLeonard: No, I did not.\nSheldon: Did you get hit on the head with a coconut?\nLeonard: No.\nSheldon: Well, then, I\xe2\x80\x99m all out of guesses. What? Me move across the hall. Why would you even suggest such a thing?\nLeonard: Because I love Penny, and want to give her the life she deserves.\nSheldon: I see. You\xe2\x80\x99re putting your future bride\xe2\x80\x99s happiness above mine.\nLeonard: Well, yeah.\nSheldon: Wow.\nScene: Amy\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nSheldon: How dare the university force me to go back to string theory?\nAmy: They just don\xe2\x80\x99t appreciate you.\nSheldon: Yeah, and on top of that, Leonard has the audacity to suggest that now that he and Penny are engaged, he may not want to live with me any more.\nAmy: Here, I made you some Strawberry Quik.\nSheldon: I have real problems here, Amy. I can\xe2\x80\x99t be mollified with a beverage designed for children. Mmm, yummy.\nAmy: You know, this might work out for the best. I mean, you\xe2\x80\x99re always complaining about what a terrible roommate Leonard is. Like how he turns up the thermostat when you\xe2\x80\x99re not there.\nSheldon: Ugh, it\xe2\x80\x99s like walking into the Amazon. And not the good Amazon with one-day shipping. The awful one with birds and snakes.\nAmy: You hate the sound of all those keys on his key chain.\nSheldon: Four keys! Who does he think he is, a warden?\nAmy: See? Maybe you\xe2\x80\x99ll love living alone.\nSheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Perhaps.\nAmy: And if it turns out you don\xe2\x80\x99t, you and I could live together.\nSheldon: You and\xe2\x80\xa6 oh, sure, and while we\xe2\x80\x99re at it, why don\xe2\x80\x99t we get engaged, too? Why don\xe2\x80\x99t we get a little house, start a family? Enjoy our sunset years together? Do you hear yourself, woman?\nAmy: Sheldon, it was just a thought.\nSheldon: No. Here\xe2\x80\x99s a thought. You\xe2\x80\x99re not moving in, Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s not moving out, everything stays exactly the way it is. And by the way, I saw you make this Strawberry Quik with syrup, you\xe2\x80\x99re supposed to use the powder.\nAmy: It tastes the same.\nSheldon: No. The syrup tastes better and I don\xe2\x80\x99t like it.\nScene: The apartment.\nPenny: This is so sweet. You never cook for me.\nLeonard: Well, you cook for me all the time and, ugh.\nPenny: If you don\xe2\x80\x99t like my cooking, why haven\xe2\x80\x99t you ever said anything?\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to talk with so much heavy chewing to do.\nPenny: Sorry. I\xe2\x80\x99ll get better.\nLeonard: I know you\xe2\x80\x99ll try. So, should we talk about setting a date?\nPenny: Well, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to pick one that works with my brother\xe2\x80\x99s schedule.\nLeonard: Okay. And when would that be?\nPenny: Uh, 12 to 18 months from now, depending on good behaviour.\nAmy: Hi, is Sheldon here?\nLeonard: No, I thought he was with you.\nAmy: He was, but he stormed off and now he isn\xe2\x80\x99t answering his phone.\nLeonard: What happened?\nAmy: He was really angry that you suggested he move out.\nLeonard: Oh.\nAmy: I also mentioned that he and I could live together but he was too mad at you to realize what a great idea that is.\nLeonard: Well, he\xe2\x80\x99s been having a couple of tough days. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure he\xe2\x80\x99s fine. He probably just needs a little alone time to decompress.\nAmy: You\xe2\x80\x99re probably right. So, what are you guys doing?\nPenny: Well, Leonard cooked for me and now we\xe2\x80\x99re just having a nice dinner, you know, as a newly engaged couple.\nAmy: That\xe2\x80\x99s nice.\nLeonard: Anyway, as I was saying, Sheldon probably just needs a little alone time. \xe2\x80\x98Cause that\xe2\x80\x99s important. Not just for him, but for most anybody, really.\nAmy: Don\xe2\x80\x99t I know it. What is that, polenta?\nPenny: Amy, get out.\nAmy: Right.\nScene: The comic book store.\nSheldon: No.\nStuart: Hey, Sheldon.\nSheldon: What happened?\nStuart: I was cooking in the back room last night and the hot plate caught on fire.\nSheldon: And you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t put it out?\nStuart: I was across the street at the do-it-yourself car wash, taking a shower.\nSheldon: So when will you reopen?\nStuart: Um, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I\xe2\x80\x99m waiting to hear back from the insurance company.\nSheldon: So, tomorrow?\nStuart: I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to be rude, Sheldon, but, uh, my life is kind of falling apart right now.\nSheldon: Your life? The university is making me do string theory and my girlfriend loves me so much she wants to live with me. And now, the place I need to go when I\xe2\x80\x99m sad is damp and smells funny.\nStuart: Well, sorry I let you down.\nSheldon: No. I do not accept this. Everything is changing and I hate it. It stops now. I\xe2\x80\x99m helping you get back on your feet. I would like to purchase this comic book, please.\nStuart: That\xe2\x80\x99ll be $2.99.\nSheldon: Really? It\xe2\x80\x99s soaking wet.\nStuart: Fine, a dollar.\nSheldon: Can you break a twenty?\nStuart: No, I only have hundreds.\nSheldon: You know what? I don\xe2\x80\x99t always recognize sarcasm, but I do right now, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t appreciate it. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry for your loss. But you\xe2\x80\x99re not the only one whose day has been a disaster.\nStuart: (Light falls on ground just where he was standing a moment before) That could have killed me. I can\xe2\x80\x99t catch a break.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: I haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard from Sheldon in a while. You think he\xe2\x80\x99s okay?\nPenny: Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure he\xe2\x80\x99s fine.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna see where he is.\nPenny: How?\nLeonard: Oh, I know his password, so I can track his phone.\nPenny: You do that?\nLeonard: Not always, but ever since he wandered off at the swap meet chasing a balloon, I get worried.\nPenny: He can take care of himself. Look, we went over stranger danger and gave him that whistle.\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99s weird.\nPenny: What?\nLeonard: He\xe2\x80\x99s at the train station.\nPenny: So? He loves trains.\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s dark out and he\xe2\x80\x99s alone, I don\xe2\x80\x99t like it. Let\xe2\x80\x99s go get him.\nPenny: It\xe2\x80\x99s sweet how you look out for him. You\xe2\x80\x99re a good guy.\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s not just that. My mother would kill me if I let something happen to him.\nScene: The comic book store.\nRaj: Dude, I\xe2\x80\x99m so sorry.\nHoward: Don\xe2\x80\x99t take this the wrong way, but did you do this for the insurance money?\nStuart: No. God, you sound like the police, the firemen, my parents, my therapist and the insurance company.\nRaj: We\xe2\x80\x99re here for you, man. Whatever you need, okay?\nStuart: Uh, actually, I was wondering if I could crash at your place for a few nights.\nRaj: Sure, of course. Oh, actually, Emily was gonna spend the night.\nStuart: You slept with her? Nice.\nRaj: Well, I can\xe2\x80\x99t take all the credit. She let me do it to her, but, uh, but I can always call her and cancel.\nHoward: Hang on. I know a place you can stay and earn some money at the same time.\nStuart: Great.\nHoward: I just have to warn you, it\xe2\x80\x99ll involve humiliation, degradation and verbal abuse.\nStuart: So what\xe2\x80\x99s the catch?\nScene: The train station.\nLeonard: Sheldon.\nSheldon: You tracked my phone?\nLeonard: Yeah.\nSheldon: Boy, you chase one balloon for three miles.\nPenny: We were worried about you.\nSheldon: Don\xe2\x80\x99t be melodramatic. I\xe2\x80\x99m just getting on a train and leaving forever.\nLeonard: Seriously? You don\xe2\x80\x99t even have a change of clothes or a toothbrush.\nSheldon: My plan is to stop at malls and buy what I need. It\xe2\x80\x99s called living off the land.\nLeonard: Okay, I know you\xe2\x80\x99re upset and there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of stuff going on, but it\xe2\x80\x99s nothing we can\xe2\x80\x99t work out. Come on, let\xe2\x80\x99s get you home.\nSheldon: No. I\xe2\x80\x99ve reached my breaking point. I need to leave. Now.\nPenny: And go where?\nSheldon: It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter.\nLeonard: So a few things don\xe2\x80\x99t go your way and your best decision is to ride the rails like a hobo?\nSheldon: I suppose it is. Except I have a credit card. And I refuse to carry my laptop at the end of a stick. And I\xe2\x80\x99d sooner die than eat beans out of a can.\nLeonard: Come on, come home with us and tomorrow I\xe2\x80\x99ll, I\xe2\x80\x99ll take you to Legoland.\nSheldon: Legoland is not the solution to everything. And it\xe2\x80\x99s too much of a scene since that movie came out.\nLeonard: Then what can I do?\nSheldon: Leonard, I am overwhelmed. Everything is changing and it\xe2\x80\x99s simply too much. I need to get away and think.\nLeonard: Oh, come on, you know you\xe2\x80\x99re overreacting.\nPenny: Leonard, hang on. Just come here. Maybe we need to let him go.\nLeonard: What? Why?\nPenny: It might be good for him.\nLeonard: You know he can\xe2\x80\x99t take a trip like this by himself.\nPenny: He\xe2\x80\x99s a grown man.\nLeonard: No, he looks like a grown man. You\xe2\x80\x99ve seen Freaky Friday, sometimes little kids end up in big person bodies.\nPenny: Leonard, we can\xe2\x80\x99t protect him forever.\nLeonard: I know, but\xe2\x80\xa6\nPenny: He\xe2\x80\x99ll be okay. You taught him well, Padawan.\nSheldon: Good Lord. Padawan\xe2\x80\x99s the student, not the teacher.\nPenny: Seriously, let him go.\nLeonard: Sheldon, if you really need to do this, I\xe2\x80\x99m not gonna stand in your way.\nSheldon: I do.\nLeonard: Okay. Good luck.\nPenny: Be safe and call us.\nSheldon: I will.\nLeonard: Bye, buddy. Sheldon?\nSheldon: Yes?\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna miss you.\nSheldon: Of course you are.\nLeonard: He just made that easier.\nPenny: Mm.\nScene: Mrs Wolowitz\xe2\x80\x99s house.\nStuart: Hey. What are you guys still doing here? I got this, go. Go home.\nHoward: You sure?\nStuart: Yeah, she\xe2\x80\x99s fed, she took her pills, she\xe2\x80\x99s all tucked in and watching TV.\nBernadette: So, she\xe2\x80\x99s not too much for you?\nStuart: Are you kidding? I love her, she\xe2\x80\x99s great.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Stewie, you gonna watch Wheel of Fortune with me?\nStuart: Coming, Debbie.\nHoward: You call her Debbie?\nStuart: She insisted. So, hey, guys, thank you so much. This job is a dream come true.\nHoward: Was that a little weird?\nBernadette: Yeah. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why, but something about it feels unnatural.\nHoward: Okay, let\xe2\x80\x99s go.\nBernadette: Yep.\nScene: The apartment.\nAmy (on phone): Okay, Sheldon, thanks for checking in. Talk to you tomorrow? Oh, okay, bye.\nLeonard: He\xe2\x80\x99s okay?\nAmy: Actually sounds like he\xe2\x80\x99s doing pretty well.\nPenny: I really think this is gonna be for the best.\nLeonard: Me, too. And he was able to take a sabbatical from\xe2\x80\xa6\nAmy: How could you let him go?\nAdvertisements'
