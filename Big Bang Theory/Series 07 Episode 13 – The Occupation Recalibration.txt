b'Scene: The stairwell.\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s an outrage.\nLeonard: I know.\nSheldon: The university, they think they can do whatever they want. We just have to sit there and take it.\nLeonard: You need to let it go, Sheldon.\nSheldon: You work tirelessly for someone, and this is what you get.\nLeonard: Oh, my God, they\xe2\x80\x99re just making you use your vacation days.\nSheldon: But I don\xe2\x80\x99t want a vacation.\nLeonard: Okay, listen, I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to diminish what you\xe2\x80\x99re going through, but I\xe2\x80\x99m a little distracted right now.\nSheldon: Oh, this again? So, Penny proposed, you didn\xe2\x80\x99t say yes, and now you think you may have lost her love forever. How does this compare to me being forced to relax for a few days?\nLeonard: It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t.\nSheldon: Thank you.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna go talk to Penny.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m going to go inside, put on my coziest pajamas, curl up with a good book and wait for this nightmare to be over. (Leonard knocks three times) Penny. Sorry.\nPenny: Hi.\nLeonard: Hey.\nPenny: Look, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry I didn\xe2\x80\x99t text you back. I just needed some time to think.\nLeonard: Okay.\nPenny: Yeah. Come in.\nLeonard: Look, if you want to break up, just say it.\nPenny: Leonard\xe2\x80\xa6\nLeonard: No, no, no, no. I take it back. Don\xe2\x80\x99t say it. Just, just hate me, but stay with me. It worked for my parents.\nPenny: Listen, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to break up with you.\nLeonard: Oh. Oh, okay. Good, good. So, it\xe2\x80\x99s cool if I cry a little?\nPenny: Yeah, I probably wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t.\nLeonard: Yeah.\nPenny: Look, you did the right thing last night. I was a mess. I was just frustrated because my career is going nowhere.\nLeonard: Look, I get it, and I want you to know that I support whatever you want to do.\nPenny: Great, because I\xe2\x80\x99ve been thinking, if I really want this acting thing to work, I need to focus all my energy on it. And to do that, I should quit waitressing at The Cheesecake Factory.\nLeonard: Wow. That, that\xe2\x80\x99s a big step.\nPenny: I know.\nLeonard: So, well, before making any rash\xe2\x80\xa6\nPenny: I already quit.\nLeonard: And I support you.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Come on, take me to work with you.\nLeonard: No. You\xe2\x80\x99re on vacation.\nSheldon: Please. What if there\xe2\x80\x99s a big breakthrough in science today and I\xe2\x80\x99m not there to see it?\nLeonard: Do you really think there\xe2\x80\x99s gonna be a breakthrough without you there to do it?\nSheldon: No. I was just tricking you.\nLeonard: Bye.\nSheldon: Leonard, wait. Take me with you.\nLeonard: No.\nSheldon: Please.\nLeonard: No.\nSheldon: Too bad. I\xe2\x80\x99m coming with you.\nLeonard: Oh, Sheldon, stay.\nSheldon: But.\nLeonard: I said stay. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to work. Do not follow me.\nScene: The comic book store.\nBernadette: Hey Stuart.\nStuart: Hey.\nBernadette: Sorry. Did I startle you?\nStuart: Yes, but at this point, pretty much any customer does. What can I do for you?\nBernadette: Well, I need a little help. I accidentally destroyed one of Howard\xe2\x80\x99s comic books this morning, and was hoping I could replace it.\nStuart: Wow. What happened?\nBernadette: Batman got his ass kicked by my curling iron.\nStuart: Well, don\xe2\x80\x99t let The Riddler know that. It\xe2\x80\x99s a comic book joke. Or maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s not.\nBernadette: Do you have this one?\nStuart: Uh, well, it\xe2\x80\x99s, it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty rare. Can you give me a few days to track it down?\nBernadette: Ooh, I was kind of hoping to get it before Howie comes home from work.\nStuart: Oh. What\xe2\x80\x99s the hurry?\nBernadette: Well, he\xe2\x80\x99s always saying I should be more careful with my curling iron, and it seems like a dangerous precedent to let him think he can be right.\nStuart: Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll do what I can, but I can\xe2\x80\x99t make any promises.\nBernadette: You know, I do work at a pharmaceutical company. If you can make this happen today, I can hook you up with anxiety medication, antidepressants.\nStuart: Really? Do you have any of these?\nScene: Amy\xe2\x80\x99s laboratory.\nAmy: Hello, Mr. Rat Brain. Not so bitey without the rest of the rat to back us up now, are we?\nHoward: Anybody home?\nAmy: Hey, what brings you guys here?\nRaj: Well, we were just on our way to lunch and wanted to see if you\xe2\x80\x99d like to join.\nAmy: Why? Because Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s not here this week, and you don\xe2\x80\x99t think I have any other options? I\xe2\x80\x99m just kidding. I\xe2\x80\x99ll get my purse.\nBert: Hi, Amy. I, oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know you had any company.\nAmy: That\xe2\x80\x99s okay. Uh, Bert, this is Howard and Rajesh. Guys, this is Bert.\nHoward: Hi.\nRaj: Hey. Good to see you.\nBert: Anyway, I wanted to show you this tourmalinated quartzthat we got in the lab.\nAmy: This is so pretty. Bert works for the geology department.\nBert: Yeah. You know what, uh, geologists and Bon Jovi have in common?\nHoward: You\xe2\x80\x99re both into rock?\nBert: Yeah. Well, see ya.\nAmy: Oh, you forgot your quartz.\nBert: Oh, it\xe2\x80\x99s okay. I want you to have it. Bye.\nAmy: He\xe2\x80\x99s nice.\nHoward: Yeah, he\xe2\x80\x99s nice because he likes you.\nAmy: What?! No, he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t.\nRaj: He brought you a pretty rock.\nAmy: So? He does that every day. Oh.\nHoward: You know, if you\xe2\x80\x99d rather skip lunch and hang out with your boyfriend Bert, it\xe2\x80\x99s totally okay.\nAmy: He\xe2\x80\x99s not my boyfriend.\nRaj: Are you sure? He\xe2\x80\x99s tall, pale and awkward. That sounds like your type.\nAmy: Should someone as lonely as you really be making fun of me?\nRaj: Yeah, grow up, Howard. God.\nAmy: What do I do? I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to hurt his feelings.\nHoward: Maybe the problem is he thinks you\xe2\x80\x99re available. Does he know you\xe2\x80\x99re dating Sheldon?\nAmy: I guess it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t come up.\nHoward: There you go.\nRaj: And does Sheldon know you\xe2\x80\x99re dating Sheldon?\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. Who are you dating?\nRaj: Yeah, knock it off, Howard.\nScene: The stairwell.\nPenny: Oh. Hey, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Hello.\nPenny: You okay?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m on vacation. What do you think?\nPenny: Why are you sitting in the stairwell?\nSheldon: Leonard told me to stay.\nPenny: Oh. Well, good boy.\nSheldon: Where are you going?\nPenny: Oh, I have a ton of errands to run. I need to make copies of my headshot, send them off to agents and sign up for a new acting class.\nSheldon: Well, have fun.\nPenny: Okay. You want to come with me?\nSheldon: Really?\nPenny: Come on, boy. Come on. Let\xe2\x80\x99s go. Let\xe2\x80\x99s go. Get in the car. Come on.\nScene: The comic book store.\nStuart (on phone): All right, thanks a lot. They have one at Capital Comics.\nBernadette: Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s great.\nStuart: No, it\xe2\x80\x99s not. I hate that place. Guy who owns it is a jerk. He\xe2\x80\x99s always making me feel bad about myself.\nBernadette: Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s terrible. What\xe2\x80\x99s the address?\nStuart: You know, why don\xe2\x80\x99t I just take you there? That way, I can make sure he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t rip you off.\nBernadette: Oh, thanks, but I don\xe2\x80\x99twant you to close up. I mean, won\xe2\x80\x99t you lose business? Sorry. That was mean.\nScene: The cafeteria.\nAmy: Penny really quit The Cheesecake Factory?\nLeonard: Yeah.\nHoward: So, what is she doing today?\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. She already thinks I don\xe2\x80\x99t support this, so if I call, it might look like I\xe2\x80\x99m checking up on her.\nRaj: Well, do you support this?\nLeonard: Of course I do. She\xe2\x80\x99s a great actress. I\xe2\x80\x99m proud she\xe2\x80\x99s taking this risk.\nAmy: That\xe2\x80\x99s nice.\nLeonard: You bought that? Great. I got to call her before I forget how I said it. Hey.\nPenny: Hi. What\xe2\x80\x99s up?\nLeonard: Oh, how\xe2\x80\x99s it going? You taking Hollywood by storm?\nPenny: Actually, I\xe2\x80\x99m at The Cheesecake Factory.\nLeonard: You got your job back. That is great news. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to say anything, but you are making the right choice. To plunge yourself into debt right now would be literally insane.\nPenny: Yeah. I\xe2\x80\x99m just returning my uniform.\nLeonard: And I support you.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s car.\nVoice: Before we begin your guided meditation, close your eyes and picture yourself in a peaceful environment.\nSheldon: Okay. I\xe2\x80\x99m inside the CERN super collider.\nVoice: Now, take a deep, relaxing breath in through your nose. And let it out.\nSheldon: Wow. Didn\xe2\x80\x99t see that coming.\nVoice: In.\nSheldon: Let me guess.\nVoice: And out.\nSheldon: What was I gonna do? Two ins in a row? Where\xe2\x80\x99s my lemonade?\nPenny: I didn\xe2\x80\x99t get it.\nSheldon: A fitting swan song to your career as a waitress, to forget my order one last time.\nPenny: Do you think quitting my job was a mistake?\nSheldon: Do you see me drinking lemonade?\nPenny: No. I\xe2\x80\x99m serious.\nSheldon: Why do you ask?\nPenny: Because Leonard just pissed me off. Am I being an idiot or not?\nSheldon: No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you are.\nPenny: Really?\nSheldon: The best way to achieve a goal is to devote 100% of your time and energy to it. When I decided I was going to be a physicist, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t take some other job in case it didn\xe2\x80\x99t work out. Which wasn\xe2\x80\x99t easy because there was a lot of pressure from Ms. Pearson for me to be chalk monitor that year.\nPenny: Thank you. I needed to hear that. Why can\xe2\x80\x99t Leonard understand it?\nSheldon: Because he\xe2\x80\x99s not like us, Penny. We\xe2\x80\x99re dreamers.\nPenny: Yeah, I need to start cracking the window when I leave you in the car.\nScene: Amy\xe2\x80\x99s laboratory.\nBert: Hey.\nAmy: Hello, Bert.\nBert: So, anyway, there\xe2\x80\x99s this big, uh, rock and mineral show next week in Santa Monica.\nAmy: Listen, um, Bert, before you say anything else, I, I have a boyfriend.\nBert: Oh. This is awkward. You thought I was gonna ask you to go with me to the mineral show.\nAmy: Weren\xe2\x80\x99t you?\nBert: Yeah.\nAmy: That\xe2\x80\x99s very nice of you, but I do have a boyfriend.\nBert: That\xe2\x80\x99s what you all say. You just don\xe2\x80\x99t want to go out with me because I have an off-putting personality.\nAmy: No, that\xe2\x80\x99s not true. My boyfriend has an off-putting personality, too. Like, way worse than you.\nBert: Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry. I\xe2\x80\x99m used to it. I mean, I\xe2\x80\x99m big and weird and funny-looking and no one ever wants to do anything with me.\nAmy: Don\xe2\x80\x99t say that.\nBert: It\xe2\x80\x99s okay. I know I\xe2\x80\x99m a monster.\nAmy: No, Bert, come on. I\xe2\x80\x99d love to go to the mineral show with you.\nBert: Sweet. It\xe2\x80\x99s a date.\nAmy: No, it\xe2\x80\x99s not.\nBert: Too late.\nScene: Capital Comics.\nBernadette: Wow.\nStuart: Yeah. Haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen this many people in my store since that Korean church bus crashed through my front window.\nJesse: Hey, Stuart.\nStuart: Jesse.\nJesse: Haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen you in forever. Look how grey you\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten.\nStuart: My hair\xe2\x80\x99s exactly the same colour as always.\nJesse: No, I was talking about your skin.\nStuart: Look, uh, my friend here needs a comic book.\nJesse: Ooh, and she went into your store by mistake. Good thing there was no one there to see you. What do you need? Oh, yeah, yeah. I got this. Right over here.\nStuart: Even you, Sweatpants?\nSweatpants: Free popcorn.\nJesse: Can I offer you a coffee? Espresso? Latte?\nBernadette: No, thanks.\nJesse: How about you, Stu? Mocha? Scone? Directions to the nearest soup kitchen?\nBernadette: Hey.\nJesse: I\xe2\x80\x99m just kidding. He knows where the soup kitchen is.\nStuart: It\xe2\x80\x99s on Merton Avenue.\nBernadette: I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I like the way you\xe2\x80\x99re treating my friend.\nJesse: Sorry. You want the book or not?\nBernadette: Not from you. Let\xe2\x80\x99s go, Stuart.\nStuart: You know something, Jesse? You may have a successful business and the kind of pink complexion that comes with good nutrition, but I have something more important.\nJesse: What\xe2\x80\x99s that?\nStuart: Friendship. Which I would trade in a heartbeat for all of this.\nScene: Amy\xe2\x80\x99s laboratory.\nHoward: The mineral and rock show? That would be awful even without Bert.\nAmy: So what am I supposed to do now?\nRaj: Prepare your uterus for his gigantic offspring?\nAmy: This isn\xe2\x80\x99t funny. I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna have to tell him the truth, that even if I didn\xe2\x80\x99t have a boyfriend, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be interested in him.\nHoward: Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard those words so many times. From Linda Nosenchuck, Tammy Rosenworcel.\nRaj: Padma Kapur, Neha Chowdury.\nHoward: Marci Grossman, Lisa Mazzarino.\nRaj: Megan Pincus.\nHoward: Tammy Cho.\nRaj: Oh, who was that girl from our Starbucks?\nHoward: Arlene Russel.\nRaj: Yes. Arlene. She wrote no way on both our cappuccinos.\nHoward: Poor Bert. That guy\xe2\x80\x99s got a rough afternoon ahead of him.\nAmy: Well, how would you want a girl to tell you she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t interested?\nRaj: I guess, uh, I\xe2\x80\x99d like her to sit me down, look me in the eye and say, I was wrong. I love you. And then maybe she could touch me in a special way.\nHoward: That\xe2\x80\x99s how you reject a guy.\nAmy: Okay, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have time for this. I\xe2\x80\x99m just gonna go find him and be brutally honest.\nHoward: No, don\xe2\x80\x99t.\nRaj: He\xe2\x80\x99ll be so upset. He\xe2\x80\x99ll probably climb up the Empire State Building and start swatting at planes.\nHoward: You want us to talk to him?\nAmy: Really? You would do that?\nRaj: Sure. We\xe2\x80\x99ve both been in his shoes. We\xe2\x80\x99ll let him down with compassion and respect.\nAmy: Thank you.\nHoward: Let\xe2\x80\x99s go.\nRaj: So we tell him she\xe2\x80\x99s a lesbian, right?\nHoward: Of course we tell him she\xe2\x80\x99s a lesbian.\nScene: The apartment. Penny and Sheldon are doing yoga.\nPenny: And hold three, two, one. Very good. Now let\xe2\x80\x99s try Warrior 2. And hold.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99ve read that there are great yogis who have such mastery over their bodies they can draw water in through their genitals.\nPenny: Yeah, well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think we\xe2\x80\x99re gonna get to do that today.\nSheldon: Too bad. It seems like a good way to drink a milk shake without getting brain freeze.\nLeonard: Oh, hey.\nPenny: And now we go to Reverse Warrior.\nLeonard: How did she get you to do yoga?\nSheldon: Well, to be honest, I thought she said Yoda.\nPenny: I\xe2\x80\x99m helping him relax because, unlike you, he supports me.\nLeonard: Oh, how many times do I have to say it? I support you.\nPenny: Sheldon, take a break.\nSheldon: Namaste.\nPenny: Okay, if you support me, what was with that phone call?\nLeonard: Fine. I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure you should have quit. But if you care so much what I think, why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you ask me before you did it?\nPenny: Oh, so now I need your permission? Would you have asked me before you quit your job?\nLeonard: Yes. I thought we were in the kind of relationship where we make decisions together. If I\xe2\x80\x99m wrong, then maybe we need to talk about the kind of relationship we\xe2\x80\x99re actually in.\nPenny: Yeah, well, maybe we do.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m willing to if you guys are.\nLeonard: Can we please have some privacy?\nSheldon: Y, No. I\xe2\x80\x99m as much a part of this relationship as you two, and I think it\xe2\x80\x99s high time we put all our cards on the table. For example, where is this going? Are you two ever getting married? And, if so, where will we all live? Have you thought about that?\nLeonard: No.\nSheldon: Penny?\nPenny: Okay, wait. What are we doing?\nLeonard: For some reason, we\xe2\x80\x99re planning a future where we both live with Sheldon forever.\nSheldon: Good. Now we\xe2\x80\x99re getting somewhere.\nPenny: Look, I know you think I\xe2\x80\x99m being reckless, and you might be right, but I need to take this shot.\nSheldon: Yeah, no kidding. Despite what it says on her r\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9, she is no longer 22.\nLeonard: I swear, I am on your side.\nPenny: You keep saying you\xe2\x80\x99re on my side, but you don\xe2\x80\x99t act like it.\nSheldon: He does that to me, too. Why do we put up with it?\nLeonard: Listen, I could never do what you\xe2\x80\x99re doing, okay? I would be terrified.\nPenny: Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s scary for me, too.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m fine with it.\nLeonard: My point is, just because I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t. And I\xe2\x80\x99m proud of you.\nPenny: Okay. Thank you.\nSheldon: Well, to celebrate this reconciliation, let\xe2\x80\x99s all share a milk shake. Uh, Penny, you\xe2\x80\x99ll need a straw.\nScene: Capital Comics.\nJesse: You\xe2\x80\x99re back.\nBernadette: Yes, I am, there\xe2\x80\x99s a few more things I want to say to you. Stuart\xe2\x80\x99s store is just fine, and he\xe2\x80\x99s a much nicer person than you are, and if you still have that comic, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to buy it right now.\nJesse: No problem. Oh, you want a latte while you wait?\nBernadette: No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want a latte. I want a cappuccino and a blueberry scone.\nJesse: I only have chocolate chip.\nBernadette: Well, that sounds even better.\nScene: Bert\xe2\x80\x99s car.\nBert: Thanks for coming to the mineral and rock show with me.\nRaj: We\xe2\x80\x99re sorry Amy didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to go.\nHoward: Really, really sorry.\nBert: Eh. Who needs her when I have you guys? Rock show! Rock show! Rock show! Rock show! Rock show! Rock show! Rock sho-o-o-o-o-ow!\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
