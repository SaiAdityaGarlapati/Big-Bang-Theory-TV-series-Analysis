b'Scene: The apartment.\nPenny: So, we\xe2\x80\x99re about to shoot this scene in the movie where the killer ape DNA is slowly taking over my body.\nLeonard: Okay.\nPenny: But I realize they\xe2\x80\x99re gluing fur everywhere except my cleavage. So, I asked the director why and he says, it\xe2\x80\x99s important to the story that my boobs be the last things to turn ape.\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s sweet that he thinks there\xe2\x80\x99s a story.\nPenny: Oh, and there\xe2\x80\x99s not even a bathroom on set. I have to go to the gas station across the street. I mean, I was dressed like half an ape and still not even close to the most disgusting person in there.\nSheldon: Leonard, I could use your assistance.\nLeonard: Sure. What\xe2\x80\x99s up?\nSheldon: Well, now that I\xe2\x80\x99ve given up string theory, I\xe2\x80\x99m struggling to find my next area of focus. So, in your professional opinion, which of these areas do you think is the most promising?\nLeonard: Huh, well, I think there\xe2\x80\x99s some really innovative stuff going on in dark matter.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s helpful. Okay. Of these four areas\xe2\x80\xa6\nPenny: Sheldon, what did we say about being a nicer friend?\nLeonard: Thank you.\nPenny: Leonard, what did we say about being a gullible weenie?\nSheldon: It is just so frustrating.\nPenny: \xe2\x80\x98Cause you\xe2\x80\x99re trying too hard. You need to do something else, get your mind off it.\nLeonard: Hey. How about we bring back Anything Can Happen Thursdays?\nPenny: Hey, that\xe2\x80\x99s good. Why\xe2\x80\x99d you guys stop doing that?\nLeonard: You made fun of us. Said it was stupid.\nPenny: Yeah. Sounds like me. Come on, Sheldon. What do you say?\nSheldon: All right. I officially reinstate Anything Can Happen Thursday.\nLeonard: Great, what do you want to do?\nSheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. What do you want to do?\nPenny: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. What do you want to do?\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m starting to remember the problem with Anything Can Happen Thursdays.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Hmm, what can we do that\xe2\x80\x99s fun?\nLeonard: What can we do that\xe2\x80\x99s different?\nPenny: What can we do that\xe2\x80\x99s free?\nSheldon: Oh, got it. We order a pizza.\nPenny: Are you kidding? That\xe2\x80\x99s what you always do. Think harder.\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re right. You\xe2\x80\x99re right. Got it. We order calzones, cut them open, eat them like pizza. All right, all right, I\xe2\x80\x99ll shake the brain bush one more time, see what falls out. Got it. There\xe2\x80\x99s a live-action role-playing group that meets every Thursday night in Griffith Park and re-enacts battles from Lord of the Rings.\nPenny: Uh, tell me more about this calzone idea.\nLeonard: You know what? Why don\xe2\x80\x99t we just ease into this. Let, let\xe2\x80\x99s go for a walk and, and, and see if we find a new restaurant.\nSheldon: Any chance that restaurant is near Griffith Park?\nLeonard: No.\nSheldon: All right.\nLeonard: Raj and Howard are at Howard\xe2\x80\x99s mom\xe2\x80\x99s, but should we call the girls and see if they want to come?\nPenny: No. Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s working late.\nSheldon: Amy\xe2\x80\x99s sick.\nLeonard: Aw. What\xe2\x80\x99s wrong with her?\nSheldon: Well, she talks a lot. She always wants to hold hands.\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99s not what I meant.\nSheldon: Well, if you were referring to her illness your question should have been, what ails her?\nLeonard: What ails her?\nSheldon: Oh. Who knows?\nPenny: Come on, anything can happen. We can push him down the stairs.\nScene: Howard\xe2\x80\x99s mother\xe2\x80\x99s house.\nHoward: Hey. Thanks for coming to hang out.\nRaj: No problem. How\xe2\x80\x99s your mom feeling?\nHoward: Okay, but she\xe2\x80\x99d feel better if she took her medicine.\nRaj: You know, when Cinnamon won\xe2\x80\x99t take her medicine, I hide it in a piece of cheese.\nHoward: Good idea. We can wrap the pill in cheese, feed it to Cinnamon, and then my mom can eat Cinnamon. So what do you feel like doing?\nRaj: I was thinking we could watch a DVD.\nHoward: Well, my mom doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have a lot to choose from. Unless you want to watch the video of her colonoscopy. Spoiler alert, 20 minutes in they find a prune pit.\nRaj: Actually, how do you feel about watching House of 1000 Corpses?\nHoward: A straight-up gore-fest? You hate this stuff.\nRaj: I do, but for some reason, Emily loves it and wants to watch it with me tomorrow, so I thought if I start with you first, then I could act cool about it with her.\nHoward: That\xe2\x80\x99s actually not a bad plan. I can sit through the colonoscopy now, but that first time I was like, oh my God, a prune pit.\nRaj: Uh, so, you\xe2\x80\x99ll watch it?\nHoward: Sure.\nRaj: You\xe2\x80\x99re a good friend. I owe you one.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Howard. Help me get out of the tub.\nRaj: Not that one.\nScene: The street.\nSheldon: So, we\xe2\x80\x99re just randomly choosing a restaurant without researching it online?\nPenny: Yep.\nSheldon: Great. You know, this is how Anything Can Happen Thursday turns into It Won\xe2\x80\x99t Stop Coming Up Friday.\nLeonard: Hey, how about that Asian fusion place?\nSheldon: Fusion and Asians? I\xe2\x80\x99m trying not to think about science.\nPenny: What the hell? What? She\xe2\x80\x99s not working late.\nSheldon: And Amy doesn\xe2\x80\x99t look sick.\nPenny: Why would they lie to us?\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s a good question. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy and Bernadette. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy and Bernadette. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy and Bernadette. Why did you lie to us?\nScene: Howard\xe2\x80\x99s mother\xe2\x80\x99s house.\nRaj: Hey. Listen to this. Murder, cannibalism and satanic rituals are just a few of the thousand plus horrors that await.\nHoward: I just helped my mom out of the tub, so, I\xe2\x80\x99m one slippery horror ahead of you.\nRaj: You\xe2\x80\x99re a good son. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how you do it.\nHoward: Beach blankets, my friend, it\xe2\x80\x99s all about beach blankets.\nRaj: All right, let\xe2\x80\x99s get this over with. Ew, it\xe2\x80\x99s got someone\xe2\x80\x99s hair on it.\nHoward: Oh, yeah, you\xe2\x80\x99re gonna do great with this movie.\nScene: A bar.\nPenny: You\xe2\x80\x99re not working late. Why did you lie to me?\nSheldon: And Amy, you told me you were sick, but you look just as pale and tired as always.\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, I just needed a break from hearing you obsess about what to do after string theory.\nBernadette: We kind of just wanted one night where we didn\xe2\x80\x99t have to hear about how miserable you are making this movie.\nAmy: But none of that means we don\xe2\x80\x99t love you.\nPenny: I haven\xe2\x80\x99t been complaining that much about the movie. Have I?\nLeonard: I also love you.\nPenny: Well you know what? Maybe I need a break from all of you. Come on, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Where are we going?\nPenny: We\xe2\x80\x99re gonna have Anything Can Happen Thursday, you\xe2\x80\x99re gonna tell me all about your science stuff and I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna complain about my movie, and we\xe2\x80\x99re gonna support each other because that\xe2\x80\x99s what friends do.\nSheldon: Okay. \xe2\x80\x98Cause if I had to pick now, I\xe2\x80\x99d probably go with dark matter because\xe2\x80\xa6\nPenny: Shut up.\nScene: A restaurant. Sheldon makes an \xe2\x80\x9cunsure\xe2\x80\x9d noise.\nPenny: What\xe2\x80\x99s wrong?\nSheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand my food. Chinese noodles with Korean barbecue in a taco.\nPenny: It\xe2\x80\x99s fusion.\nSheldon: My mother would lock her car doors if she had to drive through this hodgepodge of ethnicity.\nPenny: Think I\xe2\x80\x99ve been complaining too much about the movie?\nSheldon: Not at all.\nPenny: Thank you.\nSheldon: But to be fair, when you talk, most of what you say sounds like, wah, wah, wah, clothes, wah, wah, wah.\nPenny: Hey, I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand why you\xe2\x80\x99re not upset with Amy.\nSheldon: I am. So much so that I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna bring her here for dinner on our next date night.\nScene: Howard\xe2\x80\x99s mother\xe2\x80\x99s house.\nRaj: Okay. So, in the last 20 minutes, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen a crazy woman kissing a fetus in a jar. We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen a guy cut in half and sewn to a fish.\nHoward: And the brutal dismemberment of a rotisserie chicken by my mother.\nRaj: On the bright side, she didn\xe2\x80\x99t even notice the pill. Why does Emily like this stuff? Do you think there\xe2\x80\x99s something psychologically wrong with her?\nHoward: What difference does it make?\nRaj: What do you mean?\nHoward: Oh, come on, she could have a freezer full of ex-boyfriend\xe2\x80\x99s body parts and you\xe2\x80\x99d still go out with her.\nRaj: I do like that the ex-boyfriend\xe2\x80\x99s out of the picture.\nScene: The bar.\nAmy: I feel so bad about lying to Sheldon. How am I gonna make it up to him?\nBernadette: I\xe2\x80\x99d tell you what I do with Howard, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think dressing up like a Catholic schoolgirl is gonna work with Sheldon.\nLeonard: He\xe2\x80\x99d probably give you homework.\nAmy: Did you lie to Howard about tonight?\nBernadette: Of course.\nAmy: And you don\xe2\x80\x99t feel guilty about it?\nBernadette: Between Penny\xe2\x80\x99s gorilla movie and Howard\xe2\x80\x99s gorilla mother, I had no choice.\nLeonard: Thankfully Penny and I have a relationship based on honesty. What? I don\xe2\x80\x99t lie to her.\nBernadette: Oh, we know you don\xe2\x80\x99t lie to her.\nScene: The restaurant.\nPenny: Thank you. Hey, maybe the answer to your career question is in one of these.\nSheldon: Penny, there\xe2\x80\x99s only one cookie with something in the middle that solves life\xe2\x80\x99s problems, and that\xe2\x80\x99s an Oreo. Or a Nutter Butter, if you\xe2\x80\x99re in a pinch.\nPenny: Come on, open it. I bet it says something great.\nSheldon: This is Asian fusion. For all you know, there\xe2\x80\x99s a tiny Chihuahua in here.\nPenny: Fine, I\xe2\x80\x99ll go. Hmm. People turn to you for guidance and wisdom. Yeah, that\xe2\x80\x99s a good one.\nSheldon: No, it\xe2\x80\x99s not.\nPenny: How is that not good?\nSheldon: Turn to you for wisdom? Clearly, that cookie is mocking you. You\xe2\x80\x99d never hear that kind of sass from a Nutter Butter.\nPenny: Uh, since you\xe2\x80\x99re paying for dinner, I\xe2\x80\x99ll let that slide. Open yours.\nSheldon: Have you ever paid for a meal?\nPenny: Not with money. Read.\nSheldon: Your warm and fun-loving nature delights those around you.\nPenny: Oh, try again.\nScene: Howard\xe2\x80\x99s mother\xe2\x80\x99s house.\nHoward: Let me get this straight. So, he kills this girl\xe2\x80\x99s father, cuts off the guy\xe2\x80\x99s face, and is wearing it as a mask while he makes out with her.\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99m just gonna say it. That\xe2\x80\x99s not okay. Why can\xe2\x80\x99t I be in a relationship with a girl who likes The Sound of Music?\nHoward: Raj, you are the girl in the relationship who likes The Sound of Music. (Phone rings) Hey, Penny. What\xe2\x80\x99s up? No, Bernie\xe2\x80\x99s working late. Really? Thanks for telling me.\nRaj: What?\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m having sex with a Catholic schoolgirl tonight.\nScene: The street. Outside a psychic\xe2\x80\x99s shop.\nPenny: Oh, I think I see our next stop.\nSheldon: You can\xe2\x80\x99t be serious. If I wanted to waste my time on nonsense, I\xe2\x80\x99d follow Leonard on Instagram.\nPenny: No, come on, tonight we are trying new things.\nSheldon: Oh. That\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of incense. Or someone set a hippie on fire.\nScene: Outside the bar.\nBernadette (on phone): Yeah, honey, I\xe2\x80\x99m still stuck at work. Really? Penny said that? Okay, it\xe2\x80\x99s true. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. I\xe2\x80\x99ll see you at home. Yeah, yeah, I\xe2\x80\x99ll put it on.\nLeonard: You and I never just hang out like this. Why is that?\nAmy: I know, it\xe2\x80\x99s weird, right?\nLeonard: Yeah. We should do it more often.\nAmy: Oh, no. I mean, this is weird right now.\nLeonard: (Phone text sound) Ah, it\xe2\x80\x99s Penny.\nAmy: Is she still mad?\nLeonard: Oh, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem like it. She got Sheldon to go to a psychic with her.\nAmy: A psychic? He considers them not just mumbo jumbo, but extra-jumbo mumbo jumbo.\nLeonard: Well, Penny can be very persuasive. She\xe2\x80\x99s gotten me to do a lot of things I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t normally do.\nAmy: Because she has sex with you.\nLeonard: Yeah, she does.\nAmy: Can I confess something? Once in a while, I get a little jealous of how close Penny and Sheldon are.\nLeonard: Really?\nAmy: I mean, not in a romantic way. It\xe2\x80\x99s just, she really has some sort of connection with him.\nLeonard: Well, well they\xe2\x80\x99ve known each other a long time, and Penny grew up around horses, so she knows how to approach him without making him skittish.\nAmy: Don\xe2\x80\x99t get me wrong, I\xe2\x80\x99m glad they\xe2\x80\x99re friends. I just wish he\xe2\x80\x99d be that comfortable around me already.\nLeonard: Well, it took him a long time to get comfortable around me, too.\nAmy: Really? What did you do?\nLeonard: Something terrible in a former life? I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\nBernadette: I gotta go. Penny ratted me out. FYI, she\xe2\x80\x99s getting you a watch for your birthday with money she took out of your wallet.\nScene: The psychic shop.\nSheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to be rude or discourteous, but before we begin, I\xe2\x80\x99d just like to say there is absolutely no scientific evidence to support clairvoyance of any kind. Which means, and again, no insult intended, that you\xe2\x80\x99re a fraud, your profession is a swindle, and, uh, your livelihood is dependent on the gullibility of stupid people. Again, no offence.\nPenny: All right, Sheldon, just ask your question.\nSheldon: Okay, I just did. What was it?\nPenny: Oh, for God\xe2\x80\x99s sake. Look, he\xe2\x80\x99s a physicist who\xe2\x80\x99s trying to figure out what his next field of study should be.\nSheldon: For your information, I was asking her about the next Star Trek movie.\nPenny: Okay, I can answer that one, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be bored.\nPsychic: All right, why don\xe2\x80\x99t we begin? Your spirit guides are telling me that there\xe2\x80\x99s a woman in your life you\xe2\x80\x99re having problems with.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s an easy guess. I\xe2\x80\x99m clearly an annoying person and have problems with both genders.\nPsychic: Yes, you clearly are. But I\xe2\x80\x99m seeing a specific woman that you\xe2\x80\x99re in a romantic relationship with.\nPenny: Oh, oh, here we go.\nPsychic: Does she have dark hair?\nPenny: Yes, yes, your spirit guides are on fire.\nSheldon: The majority of people have dark hair. Even you, at one time.\nPsychic: Does she work in a similar field to you?\nSheldon: Ha. The opposite. She\xe2\x80\x99s a neurobiologist, and I\xe2\x80\x99m a theoretical physicist. My spirit guides can go suck an egg.\nPsychic: They\xe2\x80\x99re telling me that you have difficulty being close with her.\nPenny: Oh, he does. He so does. What should he do?\nPsychic: He should give himself to this relationship. Once he does, all his other pursuits will come into focus.\nPenny: Sheldon, do you hear that? I mean, Amy is the key to your happiness.\nPsychic: Exactly. Personally and professionally. Everything will fall into place once you commit to her.\nSheldon: You know what this is? Yeah, and I reserve this word for those rare instances when it\xe2\x80\x99s truly deserved. This is malarkey.\nPenny: Wow, you really struck a nerve. I\xe2\x80\x99ve never heard him use the M word before.\nScene: Raj\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nRaj: Here we go, House of a 1,000 Corpses.\nEmily: Now, just so you know, I was a nanny for three years, so if you get scared, I can totally change your diaper.\nRaj: Actually, I have to tell you something. These kind of movies really aren\xe2\x80\x99t my thing, so, last night, I watched it just to see what I was getting myself into.\nEmily: Okay.\nRaj: And I have to be honest, I thought it was disturbing and weird, and it made me wonder what it says about someone who enjoys it.\nEmily: I wonder that, too.\nRaj: Then, why do you watch these things?\nEmily: Can I tell you something without you judging me?\nRaj: Sure.\nEmily: They kind of turn me on.\nRaj: And play.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Hello. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t expect you this evening.\nAmy: Well, I was just feeling so bad about lying to you the other night, I wanted to make it up to you.\nSheldon: And how do you propose to do that? (Amy takes off coat and is dressed as a Catholic schoolgirl) Unless you have Gravity on Blu-ray under that skirt, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know where you\xe2\x80\x99re going with this.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
