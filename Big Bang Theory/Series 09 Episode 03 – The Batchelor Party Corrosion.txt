b'Scene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Would you pass the mustard?\nLeonard: Sure. Hey, want to hear a fun fact about mustard?\nSheldon: Is it that the glucosinolates which give mustard its flavour were evolved by the cabbage family as a chemical defence against caterpillars?\nLeonard: Yeah.\nSheldon: Well, that was fun. Good for you, Leonard.\nRaj (entering with Howard): Hey, there.\nLeonard: Hey, you\xe2\x80\x99re early. The movie doesn\xe2\x80\x99t start for an hour.\nHoward: Actually, we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to the movies. We are here to kidnap you.\nLeonard: What are you talking about?\nRaj: Well, you eloped and we didn\xe2\x80\x99t get a chance to throw you a bachelor party, so there\xe2\x80\x99s a van downstairs and we\xe2\x80\x99re here to take you to a surprise location for the weekend.\nSheldon: Well, I\xe2\x80\x99d hardly call this kidnapping. Where\xe2\x80\x99s the blindfold? Where\xe2\x80\x99s the duct tape? Where\xe2\x80\x99s the part where you call me and demand ransom and I try to keep you on the phone, but you hang up seconds before I can trace it and then I say I\xe2\x80\x99m getting too old for this crud?\nLeonard: When do we leave?\nHoward: Right now.\nRaj: Yeah, Penny packed you a bag.\nHoward: Wow, okay.\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re seriously going to get in a van and let these two take you to an unknown destination for an entire weekend?\nRaj: Oh, not just him, you\xe2\x80\x99re coming, too.\nSheldon: Oh, and how do you think you\xe2\x80\x99re going to get me to do that?\nScene: Outside, by a van.\nSheldon: Unhand me. This is ridiculous.\nHoward: I told you to put tape on his mouth.\nRaj: And I told you he bit me.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The van.\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s bad enough I\xe2\x80\x99m being taken against my will. I don\xe2\x80\x99t see why it has to be in some hippie\xe2\x80\x99s mobile sex dungeon.\nHoward: Well, Sheldon, there\xe2\x80\x99s something about this van that you\xe2\x80\x99re going to find very interesting.\nSheldon: It runs on syphilis?\nRaj: This van was owned and driven by your personal physics hero, Richard Feynman.\nSheldon: No.\nHoward: Yeah. A buddy of mine let me borrow it.\nLeonard: This was Feynman\xe2\x80\x99s van? That\xe2\x80\x99s so cool.\nRaj: Yeah, nothing\xe2\x80\x99s been changed since he drove it.\nHoward: I bet he picked up a lot of cute grad students in this bad boy.\nSheldon: Yeah, and talked about physics with them.\nLeonard: So, are you gonna give us a clue where we\xe2\x80\x99re headed?\nRaj: Uh, okay, let\xe2\x80\x99s see. They\xe2\x80\x99ve got spicy food and there\xe2\x80\x99s a chance you\xe2\x80\x99ll get diarrhoea.\nLeonard: India.\nRaj: We can drive there.\nLeonard: Your house?\nHoward: We are going to Me-hi-co.\nLeonard: Fun, I\xe2\x80\x99ve never been there.\nSheldon: Leonard, don\xe2\x80\x99t be fooled. I\xe2\x80\x99m from Texas, Me-hi-co is Spanish for Mexico.\nRaj: What\xe2\x80\x99s wrong with Mexico?\nSheldon: Uh, mariachi bands, wild dogs, beans that jump around \xe2\x80\x99cause there\xe2\x80\x99s a worm inside.\nHoward: Okay, calm down. There\xe2\x80\x99s a theme to this weekend. We are going to Mexico in Feynman\xe2\x80\x99s van to stay at the vacation house Feynman bought with the money from his Nobel Prize.\nSheldon: Viva la Imodium. Ay-ay-ay.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nBernadette: Come on, Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s doing bachelor stuff. You sure we can\xe2\x80\x99t take you to a strip club?\nPenny: Nah, if I want to see a naked dancing man, I just flush the toilet while Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s in the shower.\nAmy (entering): Hi.\nPenny: Hey.\nAmy: I know we\xe2\x80\x99re not making a fuss, but in the spirit of bachelorette parties, I made cookies in the shape of male genitals.\nPenny: You really didn\xe2\x80\x99t have to, whoa! That is anatomic.\nAmy: Thank you. The veins are gummy worms.\nBernadette: Oh, look, Jewish and gentile.\nAmy: I had extra dough.\nPenny (reading text): Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s Leonard. He said they\xe2\x80\x99re about to cross the border.\nBernadette: I hope the boys don\xe2\x80\x99t get too crazy in Mexico.\nPenny: Oh, yeah, right. Lock up your daughters or Sheldon might lecture them about the North American Free Trade Agreement.\nAmy: Boy, that was a long night for me.\nScene: The van.\nSheldon: Uh-oh. According to this Mexican customs website, visitors may not bring more than five laser discs, 20 compact discs or 12 VHS tapes.\nRaj: We don\xe2\x80\x99t have any of those.\nSheldon: How can you be sure? VHS was king when Feynman drove this van. For all we know, there are hidden compartments lousy with Jane Fonda workout videos.\nLeonard: If there was a hidden compartment, don\xe2\x80\x99t you think you\xe2\x80\x99d be stuffed in it by now?\nSheldon: Are we all up to date on our yellow fever inoculations?\nHoward: You don\xe2\x80\x99t need a yellow fever shot to go to Mexico.\nSheldon: You can never be too careful. I got one last year before I went to Epcot.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nAmy: So, Penny, how\xe2\x80\x99s married life?\nPenny: Oh, it\xe2\x80\x99s good. I just wish Leonard would work up the courage to tell Sheldon he\xe2\x80\x99s moving in here.\nBernadette: You guys still aren\xe2\x80\x99t living together?\nPenny: We are. I mean, he sleeps here. But it\xe2\x80\x99s only a matter of time before Sheldon has a bad dream and tries to climb into bed with the Leonard-shaped pile of pillows.\nBernadette: Speaking of Sheldon, how\xe2\x80\x99s single life treating you?\nAmy: Fine, I guess. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been focusing on me. I was thinking about changing my wardrobe.\nPenny: Yes.\nBernadette: Good for you.\nAmy: But then I decided I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to go changing who I am just because of some man.\nPenny: Yes.\nBernadette: Good for you.\nPenny: You know, it is normal to want to change your look after a breakup.\nAmy: Actually, I was thinking of making one small change.\nBernadette: Your sweater?\nPenny: Your glasses?\nBernadette: Your hair?\nPenny: Your shoes.\nAmy: Piercing my ears.\nPenny: Oh.\nBernadette: You really never had that done?\nAmy: My mom said pierced ears were for whores, pirates and genies.\nPenny: Okay, well, you\xe2\x80\x99re a grown woman now.\nAmy: I know, but Sheldon had this clause in the Relationship Agreement forbidding cosmetic surgery unless it\xe2\x80\x99s to look like a Klingon.\nBernadette: We\xe2\x80\x99ll take you to the mall to get it done.\nPenny: Why? I can do it right here.\nAmy: Really? You have a piercing gun?\nPenny: No. All you need is a needle and an ice cube. I\xe2\x80\x99ve done it, like, a dozen times.\nAmy: Oh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\nPenny: Oh, come on. I\xe2\x80\x99ll be gentle. Let me take your ear virginity.\nBernadette: This party\xe2\x80\x99s weird.\nScene: The van.\nLeonard: Hey, watch your speed. I hear the Mexican police target tourists.\nHoward: Oh, not a problem. If anything goes down, we just put Koothrappali in the driver\xe2\x80\x99s seat and slap a sombrero on his head.\nRaj: Dude, how many races can you offend in a single breath?\nHoward: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Have you watched the Olympics with me?\nLeonard: Sheldon, can you believe that we\xe2\x80\x99re driving in a van that was owned by one of the greatest scientific minds of the 20th century? It\xe2\x80\x99s like the Batmobile. If Batman was real and a physicist and his car wasn\xe2\x80\x99t cool.\nSheldon: It is extraordinary.\nRaj: Perhaps some of his mojo will rub off on us. Maybe between this and his beach house, we will be inspired to greatness.\nSheldon: I usually don\xe2\x80\x99t put too much stock in charms and talismans. However, even I must admit feeling Richard Feynman\xe2\x80\x99s butt dent cupping my own bottom that does get the creative juices flowing.\nHoward: Hey, I have to return this van. Keep your creative juices in your pants.\nSheldon: What was that?\nHoward: I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a tyre.\nSheldon: What if it\xe2\x80\x99s banditos shooting at us? What if we get kidnapped? What if we end up in a factory making Bart Simpson pi\xc3\xb1atas for the rest of our lives?\nHoward: It\xe2\x80\x99s the tyre.\nSheldon: Leonard?\nLeonard: What?\nSheldon: I am getting too old for this crud.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nBernadette: Amy, I noticed your status still says in a relationship on Facebook.\nAmy: You\xe2\x80\x99re right. I should probably let all of my Facebook friends know. Penny, I\xe2\x80\x99m no longer in a relationship.\nBernadette: Did you change yours to married yet?\nPenny: Uh, no, not yet. There\xe2\x80\x99s still a few people I haven\xe2\x80\x99t told personally.\nAmy: Who?\nPenny: Oh, just my parents and my entire family.\nBernadette: What?\nAmy: Why?\nPenny: Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to hurt my dad. You know, he always wanted to dance with his daughter at her wedding.\nBernadette: What about your sister\xe2\x80\x99s wedding?\nPenny: They started to, then her water broke. You know, if he finds out we eloped, it\xe2\x80\x99s gonna break his heart.\nAmy: How long do you think you can keep it from him?\nBernadette: Yeah, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it gonna get worse the longer you wait?\nPenny: Well, not necessarily. You know, Dad\xe2\x80\x99s not getting any younger, so if I wait long enough, I\xe2\x80\x99ll just tell him he walked me down the aisle and it was magical.\nScene: Mexico.\nRaj: When did you learn how to change a tyre?\nHoward: Every self-respecting gentleman should know how in case he comes across a damsel in distress by the side of the road.\nSheldon: If I see one scorpion, I am getting on someone\xe2\x80\x99s shoulders and never coming down.\nLeonard: And there\xe2\x80\x99s your damsel.\nHoward: Wow, this one\xe2\x80\x99s really stuck.\nRaj: Are you turning it the right way?\nHoward: No. I took the other four off and when I got to this one, I thought, you know, I\xe2\x80\x99m in a rut, let\xe2\x80\x99s shake things up.\nRaj: Here, let me try. You\xe2\x80\x99re right, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t turn the other way.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nPenny: There you go. You\xe2\x80\x99re all done.\nAmy: That wasn\xe2\x80\x99t so bad. Nice. Boy, if my mom could see me now, she\xe2\x80\x99d lock me in the sin closet.\nBernadette: That\xe2\x80\x99s a joke, right?\nAmy: Actually, the joke was on her. I could still see the TV through the slats.\nPenny: I\xe2\x80\x99m starting to see why you and your mom aren\xe2\x80\x99t very close.\nBernadette: Bet she\xe2\x80\x99d still tell her if she got married.\nPenny: You\xe2\x80\x99re not gonna let this go, are you?\nAmy: Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s kind of sad that they don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I mean, they love Leonard.\nPenny: Fine, you want me to call? I\xe2\x80\x99ll call. Why am I so nervous?\nBernadette: It\xe2\x80\x99s understandable. Amy was afraid to tell her mom she broke up with Sheldon.\nPenny: Yeah? How did it go? Did she make you crawl into the breaking-up drawer?\nAmy: Uh, well, actually, to be honest, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t told her yet.\nPenny: You\xe2\x80\x99ve been giving me a hard time and you haven\xe2\x80\x99t even told your mom about Sheldon?\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99m feeling a little dizzy from all the blood loss. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about.\nPenny: Fine. I\xe2\x80\x99m calling home, but when I\xe2\x80\x99m done, you\xe2\x80\x99re calling your mother.\nAmy: Easy for you to say. You never had to watch 60 Minutes like this.\nPenny: Hey, Daddy.\nPenny\xe2\x80\x99s Dad: Hey, slugger. How\xe2\x80\x99s my girl?\nPenny: Uh, good. Is Mom around?\nPenny\xe2\x80\x99s Dad: Ah, she took your brother out to celebrate. He just got his tenth one-month sober chip. Yeah, she\xe2\x80\x99s gonna make him a little necklace.\nPenny: Okay, I\xe2\x80\x99ll talk to her later. Uh, Dad, there\xe2\x80\x99s something I need to tell you. Leonard and I got married.\nPenny\xe2\x80\x99s Dad: You did? When?\nPenny: Last week. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, I should\xe2\x80\x99ve told you. It was a spur of the moment thing. I feel terrible. Please don\xe2\x80\x99t be too disappointed.\nPenny\xe2\x80\x99s Dad: Are you happy?\nPenny: Very. Leonard is so great.\nPenny\xe2\x80\x99s Dad: Well, then I\xe2\x80\x99m happy for you.\nPenny: Aw, thank you, Daddy. That means so much.\nPenny\xe2\x80\x99s Dad: Well, I understand it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to tell someone something if you think it\xe2\x80\x99s gonna upset \xe2\x80\x99em.\nPenny: It is. You\xe2\x80\x99re the best dad ever.\nPenny\xe2\x80\x99s Dad: Yeah. Uh, hold that thought. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been sitting on a little news myself.\nPenny: Well, what is it?\nPenny\xe2\x80\x99s Dad: You know that rototiller I got for the tractor?\nPenny: No.\nPenny\xe2\x80\x99s Dad: Oh, you should see it. It is a beautiful piece of machinery. Anyway, uh, I backed over your pet pig with it.\nPenny: Moondance?\nPenny\xe2\x80\x99s Dad: Yeah, he\xe2\x80\x99s, uh, not dancing anymore.\nPenny: You killed my pig?\nPenny\xe2\x80\x99s Dad: I did not kill him. The vet took care of that.\nPenny: When?\nPenny\xe2\x80\x99s Dad: Oh, ten, twelve months ago.\nPenny: You didn\xe2\x80\x99t tell me for a year?\nPenny\xe2\x80\x99s Dad: Well, apple doesn\xe2\x80\x99t fall far from the tree, does it? Love ya, slugger. Gotta go.\nBernadette: Okay, Amy, your turn.\nScene: Mexico.\nHoward: What are you doing?\nRaj: It\xe2\x80\x99s called Lamaze breathing. It helps you push.\nHoward: Great. He\xe2\x80\x99s pushing with his uterus.\nRaj: There\xe2\x80\x99s got to be a smarter way of removing it.\nLeonard: Yeah, this is nothing more than a physics problem.\nSheldon: Right. Archimedes once said give me a lever long enough and a fulcrum on which to place it, and I shall move the world.\nRaj: Of course. All we need is to find stuff to make a lever big enough to fix this.\nHoward: Exactly. I\xe2\x80\x99ll bet there\xe2\x80\x99s something around here that could be a lever.\nLeonard: Let\xe2\x80\x99s see, a lever, a lever.\nSheldon: Everybody hold on. Let\xe2\x80\x99s take this problem one step at a time. First, we need to decide whether we\xe2\x80\x99re calling it leever or lehver. And the sooner we decide it\xe2\x80\x99s leever, the sooner we can roll up our sleeves, not slehves, and get to work.\nLeonard: We\xe2\x80\x99re gonna be here foreever.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nPenny: Thanks a lot, guys.\nBernadette: What did we do?\nPenny: Before I made that call, my pig was alive and happy and rolling around in the mud. Now he\xe2\x80\x99s illegally buried in our backyard next to my great-grandmother.\nBernadette: Really? They didn\xe2\x80\x99t eat him?\nPenny: No. He was a beloved member of the family.\nBernadette: The breakfast meat family?\nPenny: It\xe2\x80\x99s not funny. You\xe2\x80\x99re up. Call your mother.\nAmy: Oh, maybe later. Your pig dying made me sad. And a little hungry.\nPenny: Phone, now.\nAmy: Okay. Okay. Fine. Hi, Mom.\nPenny: Try dialing.\nAmy: You saw that, huh? Hi, Mom. How are you doing? Oh, good. How\xe2\x80\x99s work? That\xe2\x80\x99s nice. I\xe2\x80\x99m fine. Hey, listen, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been meaning to ask, how come Aunt Doe and Aunt Florence never got along?\nPenny: Okay, just give me that. Amy broke up with Sheldon, she got her ears pierced and she made us eat penis cookies. Hang on. She wants to talk to you.\nScene: Mexico.\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t think the lever\xe2\x80\x99s working.\nHoward: What makes you say that?\nLeonard: There\xe2\x80\x99s gotta be something else we could try.\nRaj: If this was Star Trek, we could use a phaser to blast it off.\nHoward: No, it\xe2\x80\x99s too broad of a beam. You\xe2\x80\x99d need something more precise, like Superman\xe2\x80\x99s heat vision.\nSheldon: Ooh, the Green Lantern\xe2\x80\x99s ring could make a big green hand that unscrews it.\nRaj: If you need a green hand, why not just use the Hulk?\nSheldon: Oh, please, the Hulk would never get across the border with that temper.\nLeonard: Guys, excuse me, not that calling one of the Avengers isn\xe2\x80\x99t a perfectly reasonable choice, but we\xe2\x80\x99re scientists. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you think we can figure this out using actual science?\nSheldon: Yes, we could use science. But it\xe2\x80\x99s your bachelor party. Lighten up.\nCaption: Scientific Principle: Percussive Shock.\nHoward (singing): We will, we will percussive shock you.\nHoward and Raj (singing): We will, we will percussive shock you.\nSheldon (singing): Buddy you\xe2\x80\x99re a boy, make a big noise playin\xe2\x80\x99 in the street, gonna be a big man someday. You got mud on your face, you big disgrace, kickin\xe2\x80\x99 your can all over the place. I have an eidetic memory. Sometimes it\xe2\x80\x99s a curse.\nCaption: Scientific Principle: Thermal Expansion.\nRaj: I had no idea tortilla chips were such a good fuel source.\nLeonard: They\xe2\x80\x99re basically pure hydrocarbons soaked in fat. Let\xe2\x80\x99s hope the lug nut expands.\nSheldon: What if that burning food attracts animals?\nHoward: We have plenty of food for the animals.\nSheldon: We do?\nHoward: Yep. A six-foot wiener in a Flash T-shirt.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s not very nice.\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s a bachelor party. Lighten up.\nCaption: Scientific Principle: Accelerated Corrosion.\nSheldon: What is that awful smell?\nHoward: It\xe2\x80\x99s burning salsa. I\xe2\x80\x99m hoping the acidity and salinity combined with electricity will corrode the lug nut off.\nSheldon: What an innovative solution. Perhaps I don\xe2\x80\x99t give your MIT education enough credit.\nHoward: Yeah, I saw it on Mythbusters.\nCaption: Scientific Principle: Exothermic Reaction.\nSheldon: All right, this rust, combined with the aluminium recovered from the van, is now thermite.\nHoward: Great. Couple of pinches ought to do the trick.\nRaj: Is that enough to melt the lug nut?\nLeonard: Well, let\xe2\x80\x99s start small. We can always add more.\nHoward: You put up a good fight, lug nut, but you\xe2\x80\x99ve met your match.\nScene: A moment later, next to the burning van.\nRaj: Hey, look, the lug nut\xe2\x80\x99s off.\nScene: The stairwell.\nPenny: What? What are you doing back?\nLeonard: We got a flat and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get the tyre off.\nPenny: Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.\nLeonard: Thank you.\nPenny: If it makes you feel any better, I pierced Amy\xe2\x80\x99s ears and her mom made her sit in my closet.\nSheldon: We blew up Feynman\xe2\x80\x99s van.\nPenny: My dad killed my pig with his tractor.\nLeonard: I spent the night in Mexico with Sheldon.\nPenny: You win.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
