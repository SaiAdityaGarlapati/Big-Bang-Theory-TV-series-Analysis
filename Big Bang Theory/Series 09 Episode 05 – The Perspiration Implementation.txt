b'Scene: Howard\xe2\x80\x99s workshop.\nLeonard: Hey, ready for lunch?\nHoward: Oh, one sec.\nSheldon: Is that the prototype drive system for the high-G rover?\nHoward: No, Bernadette got me a Fitbit so she can track how much I\xe2\x80\x99m exercising.\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99ll teach her to care about your health.\nHoward: Yeah, I can\xe2\x80\x99t wait to see the look on her face when I die young.\nRaj: When was the last actual exercise you got?\nHoward: The other day, when she tried to put that Fitbit on me and I ran away from her.\nSheldon: According to a recent study, simply thinking about exercise, even while sitting still, can have physical benefits. For all you know, I could be exercising right now.\nRaj: Are you?\nSheldon: Nah, I\xe2\x80\x99ll do it tomorrow.\nLeonard: It wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be the worst thing if we were more active.\nHoward: You make an excellent point. Ooh, I think I\xe2\x80\x99m getting a runner\xe2\x80\x99s high.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: Look at all these activities the university has. Rock climbing club, archery, flag football.\nSheldon: Had me at flag, lost me at football.\nPenny: Yeah, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s great you guys want to get more exercise, but do you really think sports is the right choice for you?\nLeonard: What are you saying? We\xe2\x80\x99re not coordinated enough to play sports?\nPenny: Okay, Leonard, sweetheart, you twisted your ankle playing Scrabble.\nLeonard: I got a triple-word score with a double letter Q. If that\xe2\x80\x99s not a time to bust out the scrabble dance, what\xe2\x80\x99s the point of having one? Hey, Barry Kripke started a fencing club.\nSheldon: Interesting. Sword fighting does hold a certain elegant appeal. And I would imagine it meets many of our personal criteria for a sport.\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s indoors, so no sunscreen.\nSheldon: No throwing, no catching, no running.\nLeonard: No gym shorts that can be yanked down.\nSheldon: Or worse, up.\nLeonard: Preach.\nSheldon: And as an added bonus, the word touch\xc3\xa9 comes from fencing. It would be our only opportunity to use it in a non-metaphorical sense.\nLeonard: What about a game of tag on a French schoolyard?\nSheldon: Ah, touch\xc3\xa9.\nScene: The comic book store.\nStuart: Thanks for coming by.\nBernadette: Sure. So how can we help?\nStuart: Well, I know more women are buying comics than ever, but for some reason, I, I can\xe2\x80\x99t get \xe2\x80\x99em in here.\nPenny: All right, well, what have you tried so far?\nStuart: Uh, I\xe2\x80\x99ve, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been stocking more female-oriented titles. Uh, in the bathroom, I folded the end of the toilet paper into a triangle. And, uh, you are now sitting in the official breastfeeding area.\nPenny: Really? In a comic book store?\nStuart: Oh, don\xe2\x80\x99t worry. I, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a camera right up here, so I could watch from the counter and make sure guys aren\xe2\x80\x99t being pervs. Anyway, so what do I got to do to, to get you in the door?\nAmy: Well, for starters, you might want to rethink some of this artwork. I mean, this woman\xe2\x80\x99s actually on a leash like a dog.\nStuart: Well, you don\xe2\x80\x99t know the backstory. Maybe she kept jumping up on the couch.\nScene: The gym.\nRaj: I feel cool. Like Puss in Boots.\nLeonard: I always wanted to be a swashbuckler when I was a kid.\nSheldon: Technically, swashbuckler is a combination of two terms. Swash referring to the sound of the sword. Swash. And then buckler meaning a small shield, which you don\xe2\x80\x99t have.\nRaj: We can still be swashers.\nHoward: Well said, Puss.\nBarry: Gentlemen, welcome to the fencing cwub. Before we start, I just want to warn you, fencing isn\xe2\x80\x99t a joke. I hope you\xe2\x80\x99re not here because you think it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be wike Star Wars.\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99s not why we\xe2\x80\x99re here.\nRaj: Yeah, I\xe2\x80\x99m here because I think it\xe2\x80\x99s gonna be like Game of Thrones.\nHoward: And maybe a little Princess Bride.\nRaj: Ooh, ooh, I forgot about Princess Bride. That\xe2\x80\x99s my answer.\nBarry: Well, sowwy to disappoint you, but fencing is a sewious spowt. If you\xe2\x80\x99re not wiwwing to put in the effowt, you might as well just weave now.\nSheldon: We\xe2\x80\x99re not afraid of physical activity.\nHoward: Yeah. I already ran 18 miles today.\nBarry: Awwight. Let\xe2\x80\x99s begin with some fundamentals. This is the en garde position. Feet are in an L. Heels in a stwaight wine. Elbow is about a fist from the wib cage. Notice my dominant weg faces fowward.\nSheldon: Oh, dear.\nBarry: What\xe2\x80\x99s wong, Cooper?\nSheldon: Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure I have a dominant leg. They\xe2\x80\x99re both pretty submissive.\nHoward: When you\xe2\x80\x99re in a public restroom, which foot do you flush the toilet with?\nSheldon: Right. Always right.\nHoward: He\xe2\x80\x99s a righty.\nBarry: Okay, show me en garde. Good. Knees bent, swightwy over the toe. Non-sword hand up for bawance.\nHoward: Oh, God, I am going to feel this tomorrow.\nBarry: The first move is called an advance. You move your fwont foot fowward, heel to toe. Back foot fowwows. So fwont foot fowward, heel to toe. Back foot fowwows. Now you twy. Advance. And advance. And advance.\nLeonard: This is easy. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t need to wear a cup.\nBarry: Good. The next move is called a wetweat. Step back. Back foot first, toe to heel. Fwont foot fowwows. On thwee.\nSheldon: Excuse me, Barry?\nBarry: Yes.\nSheldon: When can I stab one of my friends?\nBarry: In fencing, we don\xe2\x80\x99t call it a stab. We call it a touch.\nSheldon: Uh, yes, I\xe2\x80\x99m aware. But if I say I want to touch one of my friends, I\xe2\x80\x99ll get called into Human Resources.\nBarry: Okay, on thwee, Cooper and Koothwappawi advance, the other two wetweat. One, two, thwee. Vewy good. Switch it up. One, two, thwee. Switch again. One, two, thwee. (Phone rings) Excuse me. Can I call you back? No, I\xe2\x80\x99m teaching a cwass. Sure. Sure. An hour, tops. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Thanks. And one, two, thwee.\nScene: The comic book store.\nAmy: Have you thought about advertising directly to females?\nStuart: Hmm, okay. Well, alright, what if I put up a sign in the window that said women, come in. Don\xe2\x80\x99t be afraid.\nPenny: Hey, have you read the online reviews for this place?\nStuart: Eh, the Internet\xe2\x80\x99s so negative. I try to avoid it.\nPenny: All right, well, Heather H says, the owner stared at me the whole time and didn\xe2\x80\x99t blink once. Kelly M says, the creepy guy who runs it asked me out, then called himself stupid before I could say no. Jessica K says, I told the weird owner that I liked his shirt. He took it off and gave it to me.\nStuart: See? Negative.\nScene: The gym.\nBarry: With your foil extended, kick your fwont weg up and push off with your back weg. Now you twy. And again. And again.\nRaj: Look at us. We\xe2\x80\x99re like the Rockettes.\nSheldon: En garde, Leonard. Prepare yourself for a rigorous touching.\nHoward: My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.\nRaj: My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.\nHoward: I thought you were Puss in Boots.\nRaj: Oh, yeah, right. Sorry. My name is Puss in Boots. You killed my father. Prepare to die.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m looking forward to him teaching us glove-slapping.\nLeonard: What?\nSheldon: You know, when my honour is insulted, and I need to challenge someone to a duel by slapping them across the face with my glove.\nLeonard: When was your honour insulted?\nSheldon: My last physical.\nLeonard: Again, that doctor didn\xe2\x80\x99t insult your honour. Just checked your prostate.\nRaj: My name is Little Orphan Annie. You killed my father. Prepare to die.\nHoward: My name is Darth Vader. I am your father. Prepare to die.\nSheldon: Ah, this is fun.\nLeonard: Well, good. It\xe2\x80\x99s nice to see your mind off Amy.\nBarry: What\xe2\x80\x99s going on with Amy?\nSheldon: Not that it\xe2\x80\x99s any of your business, but she broke up with me.\nBarry: Weawwy? Good to know.\nSheldon: Good to know? What\xe2\x80\x99s that supposed to mean?\nLeonard: Oh. I hate to say it, but it sounds like he\xe2\x80\x99s interested in her.\nSheldon: Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s unacceptable.\nLeonard: Oh, buddy, I get that you don\xe2\x80\x99t like it, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not really up to you.\nSheldon: Yeah, but he\xe2\x80\x99s dumb, and his face is dumb.\nLeonard: Look, even if it\xe2\x80\x99s not him, Amy\xe2\x80\x99s probably going to date someone at some point.\nSheldon: You really think so?\nLeonard: Of course. She deserves to be happy.\nSheldon: How dare you.\nScene: Later.\nLeonard: Listen, I should warn you that maybe asking Amy out isn\xe2\x80\x99t a good idea.\nSheldon: Barry, a word?\nLeonard: And now the crazy version of what I just said.\nSheldon: If you intend to pursue Amy, you leave me with no choice but to put a stop to it.\nBarry: And how are you gonna do that?\nSheldon: By challenging you to a duel.\nBarry: You\xe2\x80\x99ve had one wesson. I\xe2\x80\x99ll destwoy you.\nSheldon: That is why the duel will take place at high noon, three years from today. If you\xe2\x80\x99re worth your salt as an instructor, I should be ready by then. Yeah, and be warned. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to touch you all over.\nLeonard: Wow. That, that was crazier than I thought.\nScene: The comic book store.\nStuart: All right, I\xe2\x80\x99m not saying it\xe2\x80\x99s true, but let\xe2\x80\x99s, let\xe2\x80\x99s consider for a moment that possibly I\xe2\x80\x99m the problem.\nPenny: Yeah.\nBernadette: You are.\nAmy: You can say it.\nStuart: Okay, fine. What, I mean, what can I do? I get so nervous around women.\nPenny: Well, you\xe2\x80\x99re talking to us now. I mean, you don\xe2\x80\x99t seem nervous.\nStuart: Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x99cause I\xe2\x80\x99m doing that trick where you imagine the audience is naked. By the way, thumbs up, ladies.\nAmy: Do you not hear how creepy that sounds?\nStuart: It was a joke.\nBernadette: Was it?\nStuart: No, I\xe2\x80\x99m still doing it.\nPenny: Okay. Don\xe2\x80\x99t be offended, but, what went wrong with you?\nStuart: I, I guess I assumed at this point in my life, I would be married or in a relationship, or even have a pet that didn\xe2\x80\x99t run away or kill itself.\nBernadette: That really happened?\nStuart: I mean, I can\xe2\x80\x99t say for sure, but I swear that rabbit looked me right in the eye before it hopped in front of that car. Anyway, the longer I\xe2\x80\x99m alone, the more desperate I get.\nAmy: Stuart, believe it or not, I understand. You know, before I met Sheldon, I was alone for a really long time. I was so desperate for people to like me, when I met these guys, it took everything in my power to hide my insecurity.\nStuart: Okay, we\xe2\x80\x99re all feeling it. Yes, I\xe2\x80\x99ll go out with you.\nAmy: Suddenly, the rabbit thing makes sense.\nScene: A sports bar.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m surprised you wanted to go to a sports bar, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Look at this blister. Like it or not, we\xe2\x80\x99re athletes now. Besides, a bar is where I belong. I\xe2\x80\x99m having female problems.\nLeonard: If you\xe2\x80\x99re cranky and retaining water, I have a theory.\nHoward: Sheldon, instead of focusing on Amy dating other guys, maybe you should start thinking about dating another girl.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s ridiculous.\nRaj: Why? You never thought you\xe2\x80\x99d end up in a relationship, and then you met Amy. Maybe there\xe2\x80\x99s someone else out there for you.\nSheldon: True, but Penny\xe2\x80\x99s married, and so is Bernadette. And your girlfriend has red hair and white skin, which really rubs up against my clown phobia.\nLeonard: Maybe you should consider women who aren\xe2\x80\x99t in serious relationships with your closest friends?\nSheldon: There\xe2\x80\x99s that prostate doctor, but I\xe2\x80\x99m still mad at her. Oh, there\xe2\x80\x99s a woman. I\xe2\x80\x99ll make her my girlfriend.\nRaj: Whoa, whoa. Walking up to a strange woman in a bar usually doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work.\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re forgetting something. Ladies love jocks.\nRaj: How many sips of that beer did he have?\nLeonard: Three.\nHoward: Oh, boy.\nSheldon: Excuse me. I\xe2\x80\x99m recovering from a recent breakup, and I\xe2\x80\x99m told asking out another woman might make me feel better. And as Ash Ketchum said to Pikachu, I choose you.\nWoman: What?\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s a Pok\xc3\xa9mon reference.\nWoman: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what that means.\nSheldon: Well, we gave it a shot. How about you?\nOlder woman: I\xe2\x80\x99m married, and I\xe2\x80\x99m her grandmother.\nSheldon: Ah, what might have been. And you, give my regards to Barnum and Bailey.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nBernadette: Stuart took that rejection like a pro.\nPenny: Well, he knew he was on the breast cam.\nAmy: I don\xe2\x80\x99t have much experience turning men down. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t so much fun.\nBernadette: Oh, you get used to it. Some guys you have to turn down over and over.\nPenny: And sometimes we marry them anyway.\nAmy (Phone text sound): Huh. Well, this is weird.\nPenny: What?\nAmy: Barry Kripke just asked me out.\nBernadette: Oh. Look at you, two guys in one day.\nPenny: I told you things would change if you plucked your eyebrows.\nBernadette: What did he say?\nAmy: Hi, how are you? I was wondering if you\xe2\x80\x99d like to get a drink after work sometime.\nPenny: Well, what are you gonna do?\nAmy: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I guess I assumed that I would eventually date other people, but this is happening so fast.\nBernadette: What can it hurt?\nAmy: Well, I was hoping the next person I dated would be a little less like Sheldon.\nBernadette: You mean, not a scientist?\nPenny: I think she means not a weirdo.\nBernadette: Are you attracted to him?\nAmy: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\nPenny: All right, well, what happens if you imagine him naked?\nAmy: Oh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have to imagine it.\nScene: The stairwell.\nSheldon: I smell funny. I taste salty.\nLeonard: You\xe2\x80\x99re just sweaty from exercise.\nSheldon: And kind of delicious. I wonder how many licks it would take to get to the centre of me.\nLeonard: I know it only takes one doctor\xe2\x80\x99s finger.\nAmy: Hello.\nSheldon: Hello.\nLeonard: We should let you guys talk.\nBernadette: Yeah.\nSheldon: You don\xe2\x80\x99t have to leave.\nLeonard: Look at me go.\nAmy: Uh, Bernadette, you\xe2\x80\x99re my ride.\nBernadette: Walk.\nAmy: How have you been?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m doing all right. I tried fencing today.\nAmy: How\xe2\x80\x99d that go?\nSheldon: It was pretty easy. And I think my background in mathletics helped. Barry Kripke was there. I should let you know that he expressed interest in asking you out.\nAmy: Well, actually, he, he already did.\nSheldon: Okay. But don\xe2\x80\x99t get too attached to him. in two years, 364 days, he\xe2\x80\x99s a dead man.\nAmy: I said no.\nSheldon: Interesting. I asked two women out today, and they both said no.\nAmy: I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know you were interested in dating.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99ve been told it\xe2\x80\x99s a good way to move on.\nAmy: Oh. Okay. Anyway, um, it\xe2\x80\x99s nice to see you. You look good.\nSheldon: Thanks. And I taste good too.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s kitchen.\nBernadette: Howie?\nHoward: What\xe2\x80\x99s up?\nBernadette: Why does your Fitbit say you ran 174 miles yesterday?\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
