b'Scene: The apartment\nPenny: Hey, can I ask you a question?\nLeonard: Sure.\nPenny: You\xe2\x80\x99ve had this dart board since I\xe2\x80\x99ve known you, but I\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen you play.\nLeonard: Oh, uh, we played, once. I broke a window.\nPenny: What window?\nLeonard: That one over there.\nSheldon: Leonard, where are the Skee-Ball tickets?\nLeonard: Skee-Ball tickets?\nSheldon: Yeah, from when we went to the arcade three years ago? I finally decided what prize I want. Hurry up.\nLeonard: Uh, if I still have them, they\xe2\x80\x99re probably in the junk box.\nPenny: Ooh, what are you gonna get?\nSheldon: None of your business. But when you see me wearing a flower in my lapel later, you are most welcome to sniff it.\nLeonard: Yup, oh, here you go.\nSheldon: Oh, thank you. Here, get yourself an eraser for your troubles.\nLeonard: Oh. I forgot about this. My aunt made it for me when I started college.\nPenny: Aw, did she hate you?\nLeonard: Why? Because I got an ugly, itchy sweater, and my brother got a car? No, I was her favorite.\nSheldon: I seem to be a few tickets short. Are there more in the box?\nLeonard: Hmm, I think I got them all. Nope, they\xe2\x80\x99re not in there.\nSheldon: Well, you barely looked. Let me see.\nLeonard: No, no, no, I, I looked, and there\xe2\x80\x99s, there\xe2\x80\x99s, there\xe2\x80\x99s no more tickets.\nSheldon: Leonard, let me look in the box.\nLeonard: Okay, okay. I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna show you what\xe2\x80\x99s in the box. But just promise not to flip out.\nSheldon: Why would I flip out? Is it a spider? It\xe2\x80\x99s a spider.\nPenny: No, if it was a spider, Lenny would\xe2\x80\x99ve flipped out.\nLeonard: Okay, Sheldon, I know I was supposed to return this DVD a long time ago, and I know we rented it on your card. But it\xe2\x80\x99s been, like, seven years and clearly nothing bad has happened. So in-in-in-instead of being a giant pain in the ass like you always are, what if this one time you just tried staying calm?\nSheldon: That seems like a reasonable request. Although so did, hey, Leonard, would you mind returning that DVD?\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. I\xe2\x80\x99ll, I\xe2\x80\x99ll take care of it.\nSheldon: Okay.\nLeonard: I mean it, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to.\nSheldon: I believe you.\nLeonard: And you\xe2\x80\x99re going to stay calm?\nSheldon: I said I would.\nLeonard: How about that? Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s being reasonable.\nPenny: Yeah, it\xe2\x80\x99s freaking me out. I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna go.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: So, when you say you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to freak out about the DVD, here\xe2\x80\x99s what that means. Don\xe2\x80\x99t fixate on it. Don\xe2\x80\x99t wake me up in the middle of the night. Or nag me through the door while I\xe2\x80\x99m on the toilet.\nSheldon: Okay, first, talking to you while you\xe2\x80\x99re on the toilet isn\xe2\x80\x99t exactly a picnic for me either, okay? Remember, when you can hear me, I can hear you. And second, you completely disregard how uncomfortable unresolved issues are for me. It\xe2\x80\x99s, it\xe2\x80\x99s like, a, an itch in my brain I can\xe2\x80\x99t scratch.\nLeonard: When I broke my arm I used to stick a coat hanger down there. You ever try that? Maybe go in through the ear?\nSheldon: You wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t make jokes if you could feel the way I feel.\nLeonard: Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how to do that.\nSheldon: How about this? I promise I won\xe2\x80\x99t pester you about the DVD. You can defecate in peace. That\xe2\x80\x99s a win for both of us. But, until this matter is resolved, I would like you to wear this sweater. With nothing underneath it.\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99s stupid. Why?\nSheldon: You say it\xe2\x80\x99s itchy and uncomfortable. I say situations like this make me feel the same way.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m telling you, try the hanger.\nSheldon: Put it on. Let\xe2\x80\x99s share the experience.\nLeonard: You got it. If this sweater shuts you up, I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna make a fortune selling them to everyone we know. Now all I need to do is head down to the video store and return the DVD.\nSheldon: Oh, did I forget to tell you? That store went out of business years ago.\nLeonard: Really?\nSheldon: How those nipples feeling, chief?\nScene: The cheesecake factory bar.\nBernadette: Penny, can we please get our drinks?\nPenny: Yeah, hang on, just give me sec.\nAmy: At work today, I did an in vivo stereotaxic surgery.\nBernadette: Cool. At my lab, I performed ten laser capture micro-dissections.\nPenny: I scraped gum off the bottom of that table. Only \xe2\x80\x99cause my manager saw me put it there.\nAmy: Oh, my gosh. That\xe2\x80\x99s the girl that broke Rajesh\xe2\x80\x99s heart.\nBernadette: That\xe2\x80\x99s Lucy?\nPenny: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why but I always pictured her as Indian.\nBernadette: I think that reason\xe2\x80\x99s called racism.\nPenny: I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna go talk to her.\nBernadette: Why? What are you gonna say?\nPenny: I\xe2\x80\x99m not gonna say anything. I just want to check her out. Because she hurt my friend. My Indian friend. Who\xe2\x80\x99s racist now?\nBernadette: You because you just called him your Indian friend.\nPenny: Yeah, well, you\xe2\x80\x99re short.\nAmy: We\xe2\x80\x99re never getting our drinks.\nBernadette: No, but we knew that.\nPenny: Hey, can I start you off with something to drink?\nLucy: Oh, water would be great.\nPenny: Okay. Um, you\xe2\x80\x99re Lucy, right? I\xe2\x80\x99m a friend of Raj Koothrappali\xe2\x80\x99s. Actually Amy recognized you.\nLucy: Wow. How\xe2\x80\x99s he doing?\nPenny: Oh, you know, he\xe2\x80\x99s good.\nLucy: Great.\nPenny: Yeah, this is none of my business. But why did you break up with him in an e-mail?\nLucy: Oh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I guess I thought it would be easier.\nPenny: Yeah, I get that. I\xe2\x80\x99ll go get you your water. When you say easier, you mean easier for you, right? \xe2\x80\x98Cause it certainly didn\xe2\x80\x99t make it easier for him.\nLucy: Any chance I can get a different waitress?\nPenny: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, this is rude of me. I will go get that water. See, see, see, see. Just now you expressed your feelings to my face. How come you could do that with me, but not Raj?\nLucy: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know your e-mail.\nPenny: You know what the worst part is? You\xe2\x80\x99re sitting here, perfectly happy and he\xe2\x80\x99s at home, a blubbering mess.\nLucy: Oh, I thought you said he was okay.\nPenny: Well, I also said I was getting you water, but look at me still standing here. You know, I may be a bad waitress, but you are a bad person. Now, you want to hear the specials?\nScene: The apartment.\nHoward: So, you can never take it off?\nLeonard: No.\nRaj: Not even to sleep?\nLeonard: No.\nHoward: So, you\xe2\x80\x99re just an idiot?\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s called proving a point.\nHoward: Is the point that you\xe2\x80\x99re an idiot?\nSheldon: Gentlemen, please. Leonard is trying to walk a mile in my metaphorical shoes. He can\xe2\x80\x99t walk in my actual shoes. He has the feet of a toddler.\nRaj: So, how are you gonna return the DVD if the store went out of business?\nLeonard: Monday morning I\xe2\x80\x99ll go downtown, look up the owner\xe2\x80\x99s information and send him the DVD. Pay the late fee, and prove to Sheldon that you can have a problem and solve it without acting like a complete lunatic. Ah!\nHoward: And the man impersonating a bear would like everyone to know that only you can prevent forest fires.\nRaj: I don\xe2\x80\x99t get it.\nHoward: You didn\xe2\x80\x99t have Smokey the Bear in India?\nRaj: No. Oh, is he anything like, uh, Mun-Mun the Mongoose? He taught us not to play with cobras.\nHoward: You had to be taught not to play with cobras?\nRaj: You had to be taught not to burn down the forest?\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nPenny: Hey, if you guys were hungry, why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you order something at the restaurant?\nBernadette: We did, you never brought it.\nPenny: Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s right. Nachos and a turkey club.\nAmy: Not even close.\nPenny: Well, I was too busy standing up for my friend to worry about your, I want to say salmon.\nAmy: You want to say sorry.\nBernadette: So, how are you gonna tell Raj abut what you did?\nPenny: What do you mean how? What\xe2\x80\x99s the big deal?\nAmy: You told Lucy he was a pathetic mess.\nBernadette: Then you made her cry and leave.\nPenny: Okay, you guys are overreacting. Raj is gonna appreciate how I had his back.\nScene: The same, later.\nRaj: What is wrong with you, Penny? You ruined any chance I had of getting back with Lucy. Now she knows I\xe2\x80\x99m a desperate mess instead of just being pretty sure. (Phone text sound) It\xe2\x80\x99s Lucy. She wants to meet for coffee. I love you, Penny.\nScene: Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s office.\nHoward: Hey, what\xe2\x80\x99re you working on?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking about how one could use the fact that a rapidly rotating mirror turns virtual photons into real ones as a method of observing dark energy.\nHoward: That\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty cool idea.\nSheldon: Yeah. It\xe2\x80\x99s great you\xe2\x80\x99re here. I\xe2\x80\x99d love to get an engineer\xe2\x80\x99s opinion.\nHoward: Sure.\nSheldon: This chair is squeaky. Now, do I fix it or get a new one?\nLeonard: Well, Sheldon, it took me all morning, but I found the owner of the video store. And I am happy to report that he died peacefully in his sleep, drunk at the bottom of a pool. Anyway, there is no one to return the DVD to, so this issue is resolved. Ah! And I\xe2\x80\x99d just like to point out that even though the sweater was uncomfortable, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t use it as an excuse to antagonize everyone around me.\nHoward: You know, you could reimburse the video store owner\xe2\x80\x99s next of kin.\nLeonard: Or it\xe2\x80\x99s resolved.\nSheldon: Hey, that next of kin thing sounds pretty good.\nHoward: I believe this is yours.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nRaj: Can I ask you guys a question? So, I\xe2\x80\x99m seeing Lucy tomorrow night, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve never hung out with someone who broke up with me. How do you do it?\nHoward: You can\xe2\x80\x99t let her know you\xe2\x80\x99re hurting. You know, the key is confidence.\nRaj: Why is the key always confidence? How come it\xe2\x80\x99s never love handles and flop sweat?\nBernadette: If this girl hurt you so much, are you sure you want to see her again?\nHoward: Well, if I may, he has so little self-respect and is so desperate for the smallest crumb of affection, she could literally sleep with his own father in his own bed and post the video to YouTube, and he\xe2\x80\x99d still buy her flowers and ask her to be his bride.\nRaj: He\xe2\x80\x99s right. But in my defence, if we could survive that, we could survive anything.\nBernadette: Well, if you\xe2\x80\x99re sure you want to do this, it\xe2\x80\x99s only coffee, just relax and see what happens.\nRaj: Well, can I say she looks nice?\nBernadette: Sure.\nRaj: Can I tell her I miss her?\nBernadette: Maybe, if she asks.\nRaj: Oh, can I show her an oil painting I made of us surrounded by our children and grandchildren?\nBernadette: I\xe2\x80\x99d save that for the second date.\nRaj: Good, good. \xe2\x80\x98Cause no matter how hard I try, I cannot get the twins to look alike.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nPenny: What are you doing?\nLeonard: Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m just trying to find the stupid next of kin to this stupid video store owner so I can return the DVD and see the look on Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s stupid face when he sees that I didn\xe2\x80\x99t let this get to me.\nPenny: Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s not here. Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you take the sweater off?\nLeonard: There\xe2\x80\x99s a principle at stake.\nPenny: Which is?\nLeonard: Oh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Who cares? Look at me.\nPenny: Oh, my God! Is that sweater made of bees? Come on, take it off. I won\xe2\x80\x99t tell.\nLeonard: No, no, honey, if I take it off, Sheldon wins.\nPenny: Sweetie, every night you don\xe2\x80\x99t kill him in his sleep, he wins.\nLeonard: No, it\xe2\x80\x99s, it\xe2\x80\x99s almost done. I just, I have to find the next of kin, and send \xe2\x80\x99em the DVD and then just wait for someone with my complexion to die so I can get a skin graft.\nPenny: Smile.\nLeonard: What is that? What is that for?\nPenny: So you can send it to Princeton and get your money back.\nScene: The apartment.\nAmy: I must say, Sheldon, you\xe2\x80\x99re handling this DVD business with an impressive amount of maturity.\nSheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why that surprises you. I\xe2\x80\x99m a grown man. As should be evident by this sport coat and very real flower in my lapel.\nAmy: Is there some kind of new coping mechanism you\xe2\x80\x99re employing?\nSheldon: The more interesting question you should be asking is, what does this flower smell like?\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna go with sad. So what\xe2\x80\x99s the story with you and this DVD?\nSheldon: There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to tell. Maybe I purchased a book entitled Don\xe2\x80\x99t Sweat the Small Stuff and I followed its wise suggestions, one of which was stop and smell the flowers.\nAmy: Seriously?\nSheldon: Please. Ha-ha, Oh.\nScene: A coffee shop.\nLucy: Hi.\nRaj: Hello. Oh, it\xe2\x80\x99s so good to see you.\nLucy: You, too.\nRaj: Please, sit. I, uh, I got you a cappuccino. I remembered it was your favourite. I also got crumb cake, but I remembered it was my favourite and I ate it. Anyway, uh, how are you?\nLucy: I\xe2\x80\x99m pretty good. Listen, I just wanted to apologize for breaking up with you in an e-mail.\nRaj: Well, and I ate all the crumb cake. We both made mistakes.\nLucy: Okay.\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99m so happy you asked me here, and I hope we can hang out again sometime. You know, as friends, lovemaking partners, whatever.\nLucy: Oh, uh, I\xe2\x80\x99m kind of seeing someone.\nRaj: I think I know the answer to this, but just to be clear, it\xe2\x80\x99s not me, right?\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nRaj: This is all your fault, I should\xe2\x80\x99ve listened to Mun-Mun because I\xe2\x80\x99ve been playing with a cobra and her name is Penny. Why are you so cruel? Do you enjoy my pain?\nPenny: There\xe2\x80\x99s a girl at the Cheesecake Factory I can set you up with.\nRaj: I love you, Penny.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: How is it I can conceptualize a methodology of examining dark matter in the universe but can\xe2\x80\x99t figure out how to fix a novelty squirt flower?\nAmy: I think the real question is, why do you waste your time with cheap, childish pranks?\nSheldon: There\xe2\x80\x99s probably a deep reason. Which I\xe2\x80\x99d be happy to discuss with you over some peanut brittle in a can.\nLeonard: Okay, Sheldon, I am out of options. Video store owner, Nursis Manookian, has no next of kin.\nSheldon: Well, you seem hot under the collar, or is that the sweater?\nLeonard: Oh, oh, no, no. It\xe2\x80\x99s because I spent all afternoon at the Armenian church where his funeral mass was held. According to Father Solakian, no one attended. Luckily, my trip wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a complete waste. I lit a candle and prayed for your death but I\xe2\x80\x99m not Armenian, so it probably won\xe2\x80\x99t work. This is over, right?\nSheldon: Oh, not necessarily. I suggest you look for long-lost relatives either in Armenia or Lebanon.\nLeonard: Listen to me, Sheldon. I am not going to Lebanon to return Super Mario Brothers the movie.\nSheldon: You know, it might be fun. You love hummus.\nLeonard: Why isn\xe2\x80\x99t this bothering you? Isn\xe2\x80\x99t your brain getting itchy? This is on your card. This could be ruining your credit score. Why isn\xe2\x80\x99t this making you crazy?\nSheldon: Leonard, I have something to tell you, but I want you to promise not to flip out.\nLeonard: What?\nSheldon: Seven years ago, I found out the DVD was late and I paid for it.\nLeonard: What?\nSheldon: I was going to mention it at the time, but then I thought, some day, this might be a teachable moment.\nLeonard: Aaaah! I, you, how can, what!\nAmy: Sheldon, that was diabolical.\nSheldon: I know. And it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t easy. Do you have any idea what it\xe2\x80\x99s like to wait for years and never know if you\xe2\x80\x99re going to finally get satisfaction?\nScene: A coffee shop.\nRaj: Wow. You\xe2\x80\x99re even prettier than Penny said. I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe a girl like you doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have a boyfriend.\nGirl: Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t.\nRaj: I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe you, you\xe2\x80\x99re lying to me.\nGirl: What?\nRaj: Oh, it\xe2\x80\x99s okay. I have no morals and I\xe2\x80\x99m desperately lonely. I\xe2\x80\x99ll be the other man if you want a little something-something on the side.\nScene: The cheesecake factory.\nGirl (to Penny): What is wrong with you?\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nPenny (to Raj): What is wrong with you?\nScene: Raj\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nRaj (to a mirror): What is wrong with you?\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
