b'Scene: The apartment.\nLeonard: Look at us. Getting ready for a double date with actual women who publicly acknowledge they\xe2\x80\x99re our girlfriends.\nHoward: Yes, actual women are the best.\nSheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand. What other kind of women are there?\nLeonard: Howard, artificial women are your department. You want to take this?\nHoward: No, it would just freak him out. Listen, before we leave, I should warn you, I\xe2\x80\x99m a passionate man and I tend towards public displays of affection.\nLeonard: What are you trying to tell me, Howard?\nHoward: There might be some making out in the car or the restaurant, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t want Bernadette to feel uncomfortable, so it would help if you and Penny made out, too.\nLeonard: Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry. We\xe2\x80\x99re planning to have sex right on the salad bar.\nRaj (arriving): Namaste, white people. Good news! I rented us the four-hour edition of Watchmen.\nLeonard: Got it.\nHoward: Seen it.\nSheldon: Detailed analysis posted online.\nRaj: Well, then what are we going to do tonight?\nLeonard: Uh, sorry, Raj. Howard and I are going out to dinner with Penny and Bernadette.\nHoward: Yeah, no more carefree bachelor nights for me and Leonard. These broncos have been saddled.\nLeonard: How did we get actual women?\nRaj: Great. They get girlfriends, and they just abandon us?\nSheldon: It is great, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? We have a wonderful evening ahead of us.\nRaj: We do?\nSheldon: Oh, yes. I just discovered I don\xe2\x80\x99t have enough room on my hard drive for a Linux partition, so you and I are going to perform a full backup, reinitialize and then reinstall all my operating systems.\nRaj: I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to do that.\nSheldon: All right. Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to perform full backup, reinitialize and then reinstall all my operating systems.\nRaj: What about me?\nSheldon: Well, I understand there are several types of artificial women. Maybe you should look into that.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: A little later.\nRaj: Dude, there\xe2\x80\x99s so many cool things we could be doing tonight. Look. At the Glendale Galleria, put on your best zoot suit, it\xe2\x80\x99s a salute to Swing music in the center court near Macy\xe2\x80\x99s. 5pm to 9pm, huh, huh? A salute to zoot. Sounds like a hoot.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, Raj, I have no desire to salute any article of clothing tonight. Much less one that\xe2\x80\x99s linked to race riots in the 1940s.\nRaj: Race riots?\nSheldon: The zoot suit riots.\nRaj: Oh. I always thought that was some sort of after-Christmas sale. Well, then why don\xe2\x80\x99t we just go to the galleria and walk around?\nSheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t need anything at the Galleria. Do you need anything at the Galleria?\nRaj: No. We would just walk around and see what\xe2\x80\x99s what.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s a semantically null sentence.\nRaj: Okay, well, how about this? From the university Web site, 7pm to 10pm, Norton Hall Multipurpose Room, mixer for grad students and faculty of the science and humanities departments. Whether you split atoms or infinitives, this is the place to be.\nSheldon: Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s certainly amusing, but I have no interest.\nRaj: Come on, Sheldon, the world is filled with people doing things outside. Let\xe2\x80\x99s go outside. Outside is good.\nSheldon: If outside is so good, why has mankind spent thousands of years trying to perfect inside?\nRaj: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, it\xe2\x80\x99s a marketing scheme. Please, Sheldon, I\xe2\x80\x99m a young, virile visitor from a foreign land and I need to strut my stuff.\nSheldon: Let me offer you a compromise. Sometimes when I feel stifled and want a change of scenery, I use my imagination.\nRaj: Oh, boy.\nSheldon: One of my favourite places to visit is the two-dimensional world described in Edwin Abbott\xe2\x80\x99s mathematical fantasy, Flatland.\nRaj: I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to go to Flatland.\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re only saying that because you haven\xe2\x80\x99t been there. I am now a hexagon in two-dimensional space and can only perceive the edges of other objects.\nRaj: Oy.\nSheldon: Is that you, Raj? I don\xe2\x80\x99t recognize your edge.\nRaj: Sheldon, I\xe2\x80\x99m begging you. I want to go to this mixer, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to go alone.\nSheldon: Well, you\xe2\x80\x99re in luck, there\xe2\x80\x99s a mixer here in Flatland. Oh, look, there\xe2\x80\x99s a sexually attractive line segment, you should chat her up.\nRaj: What?\nSheldon: Tell her you\xe2\x80\x99re a circle, Flatland gals are all hot for circles.\nScene: Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s car.\nLeonard: I hope you\xe2\x80\x99re hungry, Bernadette, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to a terrific restaurant.\nBernadette: Oh, yeah, I\xe2\x80\x99m starved. When you spend all day in a bio-lab, watching flesh-eating bacteria skeletonize small rodents it really works up an appetite.\nHoward: Flesh-eating bacteria. And yet, I still want to kiss this woman, what does that tell you?\nPenny: That you\xe2\x80\x99d be willing to die a horrible death on the off-chance you\xe2\x80\x99d get to second base?\nBernadette: Oh, we\xe2\x80\x99re way past second base. Right, Howard?\nHoward: Well, we kind of disagree about what the bases are.\nBernadette: How\xe2\x80\x99s your work going, Penny? Any acting jobs?\nPenny: Well, the last big thing I did was this production of Diary of Anne Frank above a bowling alley. But I think things might be turning around pretty soon.\nLeonard: Great. How come?\nPenny: Well, promise you won\xe2\x80\x99t make fun of me.\nLeonard: Of course, I would never make fun of you.\nPenny: Okay. Well, I went to this psychic who told me that if I cut my hair, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to get a national commercial.\nLeonard (laughing): Seriously? You\xe2\x80\x99re getting career advice from a psychic?\nHoward: Good job not making fun of her.\nPenny: She\xe2\x80\x99s not one of those phonies, okay. She wrote a book and has her own Web site.\nLeonard: Oh, gee, why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you say so? They don\xe2\x80\x99t let just anyone have a Web site.\nPenny: Why are you being such a jerk?\nLeonard: You\xe2\x80\x99re surprised? Your psychic didn\xe2\x80\x99t tell you I was going to be a jerk?\nPenny: Ha-ha, bite me.\nLeonard: Come on, Penny.\nHoward: Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you kids go ahead and chat? We\xe2\x80\x99re gonna make out back here.\nBernadette: I\xe2\x80\x99m sliding into third.\nScene: The university mixer.\nRaj: Thanks for coming with me.\nSheldon: Thanks for giving me your limited edition Green Lantern lantern.\nRaj: Did you really have to bring it in with you?\nSheldon: What if evil strikes and my power ring runs low?\nRaj: Come on, let\xe2\x80\x99s get a drink.\nSheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t drink.\nRaj: Yeah, well I do. And when my wingman is carrying a Green Lantern lantern, I drink a lot. I\xe2\x80\x99ll have a screwdriver, please. Don\xe2\x80\x99t be chintzy with the screw.\nSheldon: I would like a root beer float.\nRaj: Sheldon, they don\xe2\x80\x99t have ice cream.\nSheldon: They don\xe2\x80\x99t? Well, apparently, these people and I differ greatly on the definition of party.\nRaj: He\xe2\x80\x99ll have a Shirley Temple.\nSheldon: And don\xe2\x80\x99t be chintzy with the Shirley.\nRaj: Okay, let\xe2\x80\x99s check out the females.\nSheldon: All right. There\xe2\x80\x99s a female.\nRaj: That\xe2\x80\x99s Professor Wilkinson\xe2\x80\x99s wife, she\xe2\x80\x99s like 80 years old.\nSheldon: But she\xe2\x80\x99s female. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that the game?\nRaj: No. I\xe2\x80\x99m looking for a hookup.\nSheldon: Oh, yes. So, the point of this exercise is for you to find someone to copulate with?\nRaj: Not so loud, but ideally, yes. Thanks.\nSheldon: Thank you. And what is my function as wingman?\nRaj: You help me run my game.\nSheldon: Okay. What is your game?\nSheldon: When I lie through my teeth to a woman, you nod and agree.\nGirl: Hey, that\xe2\x80\x99s pretty cool. What is it?\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s a limited edition Green Lantern lantern. My friend is looking for someone to copulate with.\nGirl: You\xe2\x80\x99re very funny. I\xe2\x80\x99m Abby.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m Sheldon. How do you do?\nRaj: How do you do? Rajesh Ramayan Koothrappali. Call me Raj.\nAbby: Hi, Raj. Where are you from?\nRaj: The mysterious subcontinent of India.\nAbby: Ooh, India.\nRaj: You know India?\nAbby: I saw Slumdog Millionaire.\nRaj: Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m a slumdog astrophysicist.\nSheldon: I thought your father was a gynaecologist. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. (Smiles and nods)\nAbby: Martha, come here. Meet Raj and Sheldon. This is my friend, Martha.\nMartha: Hi.\nRaj: Hello.\nSheldon: Hello.\nMartha: Is that the limited edition Green Lantern lantern?\nSheldon: In brightest day, in darkest night, no evil shall escape my sight.\nMartha: Oh, that is so awesome.\nSheldon: Thank you. Have you chosen one to copulate with?\nScene: A restaurant.\nBernadette: So, what should we talk about?\nHoward: Well, we could always learn more about why people who believe in psychics are idiots. Leonard?\nPenny: Oh, we don\xe2\x80\x99t need to talk about that anymore. Leonard covered it pretty well in the car.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, but facts are facts.\nPenny: Right, and if you can\xe2\x80\x99t understand it, it\xe2\x80\x99s not a fact.\nLeonard: No, if it\xe2\x80\x99s not a fact, it\xe2\x80\x99s not a fact.\nPenny: Oh, got it. Thank you for educating me.\nLeonard: You\xe2\x80\x99re welcome. How\xe2\x80\x99s your fish?\nPenny: Amazing. Would you like to try some?\nLeonard: Yeah, sure.\nPenny: Well, the fact is, you can\xe2\x80\x99t.\nLeonard: Come on, Howard, Bernadette, you\xe2\x80\x99re both scientists. Help me out here.\nHoward: What do you think? Want to jump right into the middle of another couple\xe2\x80\x99s argument?\nBernadette: No, thank you.\nHoward: Sorry.\nLeonard: Maybe we should just stop talking about this.\nPenny: Maybe some of us should stop talking altogether.\nWaiter: How is everything tonight?\nBernadette: Really uncomfortable.\nScene: The stairwell.\nLeonard: You know, the best thing about being in a committed, monogamous, mutually supportive relationship is that even if you have different ideas, you can have a spirited debate, yet still care for, even make love with\xe2\x80\xa6 (she shuts the door in his face) Want your fish? (Opens door, takes fish, closes it again) I knew you were going to do that. Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make me psychic! Attaboy, Leonard, make it worse. (Opens his own apartment door to find Sheldon, Raj and the two girls playing Rock Band and performing American Woman)\nLeonard: What\xe2\x80\x99s going on?\nSheldon: We scored. I\xe2\x80\x99m the wingman.\n  Scene: Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s lab.\nHoward: Hey.\nLeonard (handing him protective glasses): Laser.\nHoward: Had a great night last night. I don\xe2\x80\x99t like to kiss and tell, but somebody made it to eighth base.\nLeonard: What the hell is eighth base?\nHoward: Seventh base with shirt off. Well, my shirt. How\xe2\x80\x99d things go with Penny?\nLeonard: Oh, couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be better.\nHoward: Are we taking our relationship frustrations out on innocent Cylons?\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s not just Cylons. Superman\xe2\x80\x99s next.\nHoward: All right, I was going to try to squeeze in a little more mocking before lunch, but I can come back later when you don\xe2\x80\x99t have a high-powered weapon.\nLeonard: How can I go out with a woman who believes in psychics?\nHoward: Hey, I once dated a girl who believed she was abducted by aliens.\nLeonard: And that didn\xe2\x80\x99t bother you?\nHoward: Au contraire. It meant she was gullible and open to a little probing.\nLeonard: What am I supposed to do, pretend I believe something I don\xe2\x80\x99t whenever I\xe2\x80\x99m with Penny?\nHoward: Hey, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure Penny fakes all kinds of things when she\xe2\x80\x99s with you.\nLeonard: Do me a favour, lean over, put your head right here.\nHoward: Let me show you another way to look at this. Here we have the universe of all women. These are the ones you want to sleep with. These are the women who believe exactly what you believe. These are the women who would be willing to sleep with you. And right there in the\nlittle triple intersection is your ideal mate. Odds are she\xe2\x80\x99s a short physicist with low self-esteem who lives in a government research facility in China.\nLeonard: What\xe2\x80\x99s your point? In order to keep having a sexual relationship with Penny, I have to give up everything I believe in, my intellectual integrity, the very nature of who I am? I can\xe2\x80\x99t do that, Howard.\nHoward: I respect that. (Takes Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s hand, draws a dot on it.)\nLeonard: What is that?\nHoward: Your new girlfriend. Have fun tonight.\nScene: The apartment. Sheldon is learning Finnish.\nSheldon: The dog\xe2\x80\xa6 koira. The roof\xe2\x80\xa6 katto. Grapes\xe2\x80\xa6 ryp leet. (There is a knock on the door) One minute. Sis  n.\nRaj: What was that?\nSheldon: It means come in. It\xe2\x80\x99s taking forever to load the new operating system on my computer. I disinfected the kitchen and the bathroom, and now I thought I\xe2\x80\x99d learn Finnish.\nRaj: \xe0\xa4\x9c\xe0\xa5\x8b \xe0\xa4\xad\xe0\xa5\x80 \xe0\xa4\xa4\xe0\xa5\x81\xe0\xa4\xae\xe0\xa5\x8d\xe0\xa4\xb9\xe0\xa4\xbe\xe0\xa4\xb0\xe0\xa5\x87 \xe0\xa4\xa8\xe0\xa4\xbe\xe0\xa4\xb5 \xe0\xa4\xae\xe0\xa4\x82\xe0\xa4\x97\xe0\xa4\xbe\xe0\xa4\x88. That\xe2\x80\x99s Hindi for whatever floats your boat. Uh, listen, I got a text from that girl Abby, and she and her friend Martha want to hang out with us again. What do you say?\nSheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t say anything. I merely offer you a facial expression that suggests you\xe2\x80\x99ve gone insane.\nRaj: I don\xe2\x80\x99t get it. You had a great time.\nSheldon: Yes, exactly, I had a great time. That\xe2\x80\x99s done, I\xe2\x80\x99ve moved on to other things. For example, after I learn Finnish, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to learn Finnish again.\nRaj: Please, Sheldon, I\xe2\x80\x99m a lost Indian boy far from home, and I want a girlfriend and I want her to be Abby, and she\xe2\x80\x99ll only come over if she can bring Martha.\nSheldon: Raj, I highly doubt there is any argument you can make, threat you might levy, rhetorical strategy, plea, invocation, supplication, or\xe2\x80\xa6 vetoomus that you can employ that would convince me to reconsider.\nRaj: My Incredible Hulk hands signed by Stan Lee.\nSheldon: Oh, my. I\xe2\x80\x99ve admired these for years.\nRaj: So does that mean we can go with the girls again?\nSheldon: Hulk agree to second date with puny humans!\nRaj: You can\xe2\x80\x99t wear the hands on the date.\nSheldon: Hulk sad.\nScene: The laundry room.\nLeonard: Hey. Cleaning out the old dryer lint, huh? Not only is it courteous, it\xe2\x80\x99s safety smart. Every year, 15,000 fires are caused by accidental dryer lint ignition. Now you\xe2\x80\x99re supposed to say, wow, what an interesting fact. Come here, you crazy, nerdy guy. I could never be mad at you.\nPenny: Wow, that\xe2\x80\x99s all you got after you were the most obnoxious person on a double date that included Howard Wolowitz?\nLeonard: No, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. I really am. It\xe2\x80\x99s not right to mock what a person believes in.\nPenny: Thank you. Would you be willing to go to my psychic and see what it\xe2\x80\x99s all about?\nLeonard: Would you be willing to read a book that concisely explains how all psychics are frauds?\nPenny: I would not.\nLeonard: Okay, let\xe2\x80\x99s go see your psychic.\nPenny: Really?\nLeonard: Well, yeah, one of us has to keep an open mind.\nPenny: You saying I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an open mind?\nLeonard: No, not at all. Let me help you with this stuff.\nPenny: You know, I believe in ghosts, too.\nLeonard: Great.\nPenny: And astrology.\nLeonard: I know, and pyramid power and healing crystals.\nPenny: Oh, no, no, no, crystals don\xe2\x80\x99t work.\nLeonard: Really, that\xe2\x80\x99s the line? Psychics are real, but crystals are voodoo?\nPenny: Oh, voodoo\xe2\x80\x99s real. You don\xe2\x80\x99t want to mess with voodoo.\nScene: The apartment.\nMartha: Flatland is more than just a mathematical essay. It is also a treatise on Victorian social mores.\nSheldon: You know, I had never considered that. Wow, that\xe2\x80\x99s going to completely change my visits there. Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s late.\nMartha: Uh-huh.\nSheldon: Time for bed.\nMartha: Okay.\nSheldon: Good night, puny human! (He gets up and leaves).\nScene: Outside Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom.\nMartha: Sheldon?\nSheldon: Yes?\nMartha: Listen, they\xe2\x80\x99re kind of getting busy in the living room, and I was wondering if I could hang out in here for a while.\nSheldon: Well, I suppose. Come in. I\xe2\x80\x99ll sleep in Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s room. Good night.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
