b'Scene: The cafeteria.\nLeonard: I got to tell you, the more I read about the primordial gravity wave discovery, the more excited I get.\nRaj: I know. Being an astrophysicist right now is like being a rock star.\nHoward: Only without the sex.\nRaj: Yeah, literally, none of it.\nLeonard: What do you think about it, Sheldon?\nSheldon: Meh.\nRaj: Are you kidding me? This may be the biggest scientific breakthrough of our lifetime. How can you, as a theoretical physicist, not care about this?\nSheldon: Maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s because I\xe2\x80\x99m not an elitist. What I\xe2\x80\x99d like to know is, how does this gravity wave breakthrough help the man on the street? You know? Who\xe2\x80\x99s looking out for Joe six-pack and all his quantum physics concerns?\nLeonard: Oh, my God, you\xe2\x80\x99re jealous.\nSheldon: Why would I be jealous?\nLeonard: Oh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Maybe because the origin of the universe just got proven, the Higgs field just got proven, and you\xe2\x80\x99ve been working on string theory for the last 20 years and you\xe2\x80\x99re no closer to proving it than when you started.\nSheldon: Yeah, well, I\xe2\x80\x99ve had a lot on my plate. We happen to live in a golden age of television.\nBarry: Excuse me, fewwas. Sowwy for eavesdwopping, but there actually was some big stwing theowy news today out of the Hadwon Cowwider.\nSheldon: Really? Did they find evidence to support extra dimensions or supersymmetry?\nBarry: No, but they did find evidence that you\xe2\x80\x99ll bewieve anything.\nSheldon: Why would you do that? You\xe2\x80\x99re a string theorist as well.\nBarry: Incowwect. I am a stwing pwagmatist. I say I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna pwove something that cannot be pwoved, I appwy for gwant money, and then I spend it on wiquor and bwoads. Water.\nSheldon: Do you think he\xe2\x80\x99s right? Am I wasting my life on a theory that can never be proven?\nHoward: Maybe. But how great is Game of Thrones?\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The apartment.\nPenny: Hey, you\xe2\x80\x99re up early.\nSheldon: I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t sleep.\nPenny: I told you those Walking Dead pillowcases were a bad idea.\nSheldon: No, that\xe2\x80\x99s not it.\nPenny: Is something bothering you?\nSheldon: Yes, but you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t understand.\nPenny: Oh, come on, try me.\nSheldon: All right. I\xe2\x80\x99ve devoted the prime of my life to string theory and its quest for the compactification of extra dimensions. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got nothing to show for it, and I feel like a fool.\nPenny: Okay. I get it. I mean, not all the jibberjabber in the middle, but I know what it\xe2\x80\x99s like to put your heart and soul into something and get nothing out of it.\nSheldon: You mean your acting career?\nPenny: No.\nSheldon: Your relationship with Leonard?\nPenny: No.\nSheldon: Your failed attempt to go back to college?\nPenny: No. I\xe2\x80\x99m saying you and string theory sound like a relationship, and I know what it\xe2\x80\x99s like to be in one and realize it\xe2\x80\x99s never gonna turn out the way you want.\nSheldon: I said Leonard, you said no.\nPenny: I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about other guys.\nSheldon: Okay. Well, what do you do?\nPenny: You have to have the courage to end the relationship. You know? Break it off, shake hands, walk away.\nSheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if I can do that.\nPenny: I know it\xe2\x80\x99s hard, honey, but in the end, that\xe2\x80\x99s how you grow.\nLeonard: Penny, have you seen my good inhaler?\nSheldon: Break it off, shake hands, walk away.\nScene: The cafeteria.\nLeonard: Hey, how\xe2\x80\x99s dating two women going?\nRaj: Um, kind of hit a bump. When I was honest and told Emily she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the only person I was seeing, it went great. So I tried the same thing with Lucy.\nHoward: And?\nRaj: She had mixed feelings. But when I said, Emily was cool with it. Emily\xe2\x80\x99s the best. Why can\xe2\x80\x99t you\nbe more like Emily? Those feelings became less mixed.\nLeonard: Women. Who knows what\xe2\x80\x99ll set \xe2\x80\x99em off?\nRaj: At least now I can focus all my energies on just one girl.\nHoward: I hope I get to meet her as soon as possible.\nRaj: Why the rush? She isn\xe2\x80\x99t going anywhere.\nHoward: She is. But I like that attitude.\nSheldon: Gentlemen, is anybody interested in my old string theory books?\nRaj: You\xe2\x80\x99re really going to do this?\nSheldon: I am. Yeah, Penny pointed out that what I\xe2\x80\x99m going through is essentially a breakup. And according to Cosmopolitan magazine, one of the most effective techniques for moving on is to get rid of all reminders of the relationship.\nHoward: You\xe2\x80\x99re reading Cosmo?\nSheldon: Yes. As it turns out, there\xe2\x80\x99s an article on how to get over a breakup in literally every issue. Anyway, it suggests that I set these on fire, but the smell of burning books reminds me of church picnics in East Texas.\nHoward: What\xe2\x80\x99s this?\nSheldon: Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s just a doodle of a hyperelliptic Riemann surface.\nLeonard: Oh, yeah. Wasn\xe2\x80\x99t that the basis of your postdoc fellowship?\nSheldon: It was. This seemed so elegant at the time, but now I realize I was just a simple country boy seduced by a big city theory with variables in all the right places.\nRaj: It\xe2\x80\x99s going to be okay.\nSheldon: I know. As hard as this is, I have to move on. I can\xe2\x80\x99t keep postulating multidimensional entities and get nothing in return. I have needs, too.\nHoward: So, you and Emily still together?\nScene: Raj\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nHoward: I spoke to Bernadette. She\xe2\x80\x99s free tomorrow night.\nRaj: Oh, okay, great. But if we\xe2\x80\x99re really gonna do a double date, then we have to go over some ground rules about Emily.\nHoward: Like when it turns out she\xe2\x80\x99s made of rubber, I don\xe2\x80\x99t say anything?\nRaj: She\xe2\x80\x99s very real.\nHoward: Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s what it says on the box. Right next to dishwasher safe.\nRaj: See? This is exactly the kind of thing I\xe2\x80\x99m worried about you saying in front of her.\nHoward: I promise I\xe2\x80\x99ll be on my best behaviour.\nRaj: You better be. No jokes about how close I am with my dog. Or the truth about how close I am with my dog.\nHoward: You got it.\nRaj: No jokes about the year I took ballet.\nHoward: You took ballet?\nRaj: God, you never listen.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: Are you sure you want to do this?\nSheldon: The magazine articles suggest that one of the ways to get over a breakup is a new look.\nLeonard: What about your old look, well-groomed ventriloquist doll?\nPenny (treating Sheldon as a ventriloquist doll): Oh my God, I do look like that.\nSheldon: You stop it.\nPenny: So, how do you want me to cut it?\nSheldon: Oh, how about Bill Gates meets Nikola Tesla?\nLeonard: So, business in the front, science in the back.\nPenny: Or I don\xe2\x80\x99t cut it and maybe just style it a little.\nSheldon: Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m in your hands. Do a good job and I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you Cosmo\xe2\x80\x99s ten dynamite tips to enjoy your PMS.\nPenny: Can you keep him quiet? Maybe jangle some keys in front of him?\nLeonard: That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work any more. He just thinks I\xe2\x80\x99m taking him to the doctor. So, now that you\xe2\x80\x99re no longer invested in string theory, what are you gonna pursue?\nSheldon: Oh, there are so many exciting areas. Black holes, dark matter.\nPenny: Oh, Leonard was telling me about dark matter, but I didn\xe2\x80\x99t really understand it.\nSheldon: Don\xe2\x80\x99t feel bad. Neither does he.\nPenny: Okay, what do you think?\nSheldon: Have you ever even seen a picture of Tesla?\nLeonard: It actually looks good, Sheldon.\nPenny: Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\nLeonard: Yeah.\nSheldon: I suppose I could see myself in a scientific boy band. Of course, I\xe2\x80\x99d be the dreamy one and the smart one.\nAmy: Sorry I\xe2\x80\x99m late. What did you do?\nPenny: I gave him a new look. It\xe2\x80\x99s cute, huh?\nAmy: Yeah, it\xe2\x80\x99s cute. That\xe2\x80\x99s the problem. I don\xe2\x80\x99t need other girls to see him walking around like sex on a stick.\nSheldon: She\xe2\x80\x99s right. I\xe2\x80\x99m too hot.\nScene: A restaurant.\nBernadette: I\xe2\x80\x99m excited to meet Emily.\nHoward: Me, too. I just hope he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t blow it.\nBernadette: Why would you say that?\nHoward: Because he\xe2\x80\x99s Raj, that\xe2\x80\x99s his thing. Beckham can bend it, Ralph can wreck it, Raj can blow it. Look, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want it to happen, but odds are he\xe2\x80\x99s gonna find a way to\xe2\x80\xa6 Oh, crap, I know that girl.\nBernadette: How?\nHoward: In a bad way, very bad.\nRaj: Hey, guys.\nHoward: Whatever you hear tonight, just remember I love you. Hey.\nRaj: Emily, these are my good friends, Howard and Bernadette. Guys, this is Emily.\nEmily: Nice to meet you.\nBernadette: Hi.\nEmily: Have we met before?\nHoward: Uh, no. I, I don\xe2\x80\x99t, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think so.\nEmily: You sure? You look familiar.\nHoward: Well, you sure don\xe2\x80\x99t. You I know, you I know, you? Total stranger. Even if you had yummy candy, I would not get in your van.\nEmily: Did you go to that spin class on Green Street?\nHoward: That must be it.\nRaj: Since when do you go to spin class?\nHoward: Wow. Now who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t listen?\nScene: The apartment.\nAmy: Sheldon, your food\xe2\x80\x99s getting cold. What are you doing?\nSheldon: Oh, looking through my textbooks for a new field of inquiry. Why do we have a geology book? Leonard, did you throw a children\xe2\x80\x99s party while I was in Texas?\nPenny: Wait. What\xe2\x80\x99s wrong with geology?\nSheldon: Let me put this in a way you\xe2\x80\x99ll understand, Penny. You remember how you explained to me that the Kardashians aren\xe2\x80\x99t real celebrities? Well, geology is the Kardashians of science.\nSheldon: Have you considered studying standard model physics?\nSheldon: You want me to give up string theory for something that\xe2\x80\x99s less advanced? You know, why don\xe2\x80\x99t you break up with Penny and start dating a brown bear?\nPenny: Like you could get a brown bear.\nLeonard: Hey, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a good job. I could buy salmon. You don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\nAmy: Maybe you could make your new field of study the calculation of nuclear matrix elements.\nSheldon: Oh, please. If I wanted to take up a fad, I\xe2\x80\x99d get a tramp stamp.\nLeonard: What about loop quantum gravity?\nSheldon: Oh, Duchess, look at me. My quantum gravity\xe2\x80\x99s positively loopy.\nPenny: Who\xe2\x80\x99s the duchess?\nLeonard: One of the people that lives in his head.\nAmy: I hope he\xe2\x80\x99s this distraught if he ever breaks up with me.\nLeonard: Well, if he does, I\xe2\x80\x99ll see if my bear has a friend.\nPenny: Sheldon, have you ever considered not rushing into something new? I mean, why don\xe2\x80\x99t you take your time, enjoy your freedom? Maybe something new to study will find you.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s actually not bad advice. You know, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t seek out string theory. It just hit me over the head one day.\nAmy: How does that happen?\nSheldon: A bully chased me through the school library and hit me over the head with the biggest book he could find.\nPenny: Okay, how about we toast your newfound freedom?\nSheldon: Ah, normally I refrain from alcohol, but since my cerebral cortex is twiddling its proverbial thumbs, why not soak it in grape juice that\xe2\x80\x99s been predigested by a fungus?\nPenny: And you wonder why other children beat you with books. Cheers!\nScene: The restaurant.\nBernadette: Emily, what do you do?\nEmily: I\xe2\x80\x99m a dermatology resident at Huntington Hospital.\nRaj: Mmm, and you know what that means. Someone\xe2\x80\x99s skin\xe2\x80\x99s about to be softer than ever.\nEmily: This is making me crazy. I know I know you from somewhere.\nRaj: Oh, uh, Howard was an astronaut. Maybe that\xe2\x80\x99s where you saw him.\nEmily: Wow. That\xe2\x80\x99s amazing. What was that like?\nHoward: It was the most incredible experience of my life. Up there in the space station, you\xe2\x80\x99re\xe2\x80\xa6\nEmily: Oh, my God, I remember.\nHoward: Can I finish my astronaut story?\nEmily: It was four years ago.\nHoward: Please don\xe2\x80\x99t say it.\nEmily: We were set up on a blind date.\nHoward: Please don\xe2\x80\x99t say it.\nEmily: You came to my apartment.\nHoward: You\xe2\x80\x99re saying it.\nRaj: Wh, what happened?\nBernadette: Yeah, what happened?\nHoward: Okay, I\xe2\x80\x99ll say it. I was on the way to pick her up. My stomach felt a little funny. When I got there, I asked if I could use her bathroom.\nBernadette: Please don\xe2\x80\x99t say it.\nHoward: One roll of toilet paper and 20 minutes later, I was so humiliated, I snuck out the window and never saw her again.\nEmily: You know what else I never saw again, my security deposit.\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. I tried to unclog it, but you didn\xe2\x80\x99t have a plunger, and water was spilling out everywhere.\nEmily: Right, just water.\nHoward: Look, I have felt terrible about this for years, and I\xe2\x80\x99m glad I have the opportunity to tell you just how sorry I am.\nEmily: It\xe2\x80\x99s fine. All my friends love this story. They call you Clogzilla.\nRaj: Get it? Because you clogged up her bathroom like a radioactive monster!\nHoward: Yeah, yeah, I get it.\nBernadette: Howie.\nHoward: Well, hey, it\xe2\x80\x99s not like cotton candy comes out of you.\nScene: The apartment.\nAmy: Come on, let\xe2\x80\x99s get you to bed. You\xe2\x80\x99ve had a lot to drink.\nSheldon: No more than Penny.\nAmy: That\xe2\x80\x99s what I\xe2\x80\x99m saying.\nSheldon: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. (Knock, knock, knock) Empty room. (Knock, knock, knock) Empty room. (Knock, knock, knock) Empty room. If somebody says come in, I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna freak out.\nScene: The restaurant.\nBernadette: So, Emily, why did you decide to specialize in dermatology?\nEmily: I like cutting people with knives, and all the other jobs where you get to do that are illegal.\nBernadette: You\xe2\x80\x99re kidding, right?\nRaj: She\xe2\x80\x99s scary, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a cute scary.\nHoward: Can I say just one more thing? I had some kind of food poisoning that day. Sure, in retrospect, gas station sushi, maybe not the best choice. Nor was climbing out your window and running away. But I think we can all understand how humiliating that was, and I\xe2\x80\x99d really appreciate it if we could move on.\nBernadette: Howie, we moved on a long time ago.\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m just saying\xe2\x80\xa6\nBernadette: We moved on.\nHoward: Okay. Fine.\nBernadette: How\xe2\x80\x99s your soup?\nHoward: Ah, it\xe2\x80\x99s all right. They could\xe2\x80\x99ve filled the bowl a little more. Excuse me.\nBernadette: Where are you going?\nHoward: I need some fresh air.\nEmily: Been there.\nScene: Sheldon, waking up in bed next to a Geology book.\nSheldon: Oh, no. What have I done?\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: How you feeling?\nSheldon: Not so good.\nLeonard: Are you gonna introduce me to your friend?\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s not my friend. Nothing happened.\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I heard you reading pretty loud last night.\nSheldon: Oh, dear Lord. Where\xe2\x80\x99s Amy?\nLeonard: After she put you to bed, she went home.\nSheldon: Oh. I should call her and apologize. Oh, no.\nLeonard: What?\nSheldon: Apparently, I called Stephen Hawking last night.\nScene: Stephen Hawking\xe2\x80\x99s office.\nAnswerphone: First new message.\nSheldon (voice): Hawkman. It\xe2\x80\x99s your old buddy Sheldonoscopy. How come you didn\xe2\x80\x99t pick up the phone? Oh, right. My bad.\nScene: The cafeteria..\nHoward: You\xe2\x80\x99re awful quiet. Everything okay?\nSheldon: Not really. I had a bit of an embarrassing evening.\nHoward: Ugh. Me, too. What happened?\nSheldon: I drank alcohol and may have left an unfortunate voice mail for Stephen Hawking.\nHoward: I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t worry about it. He\xe2\x80\x99s got a pretty good sense of humour.\nSheldon: Oh, I hope so. What happened to you last night?\nHoward: Oh, well, turns out I\xe2\x80\x99d already met the girl Raj is seeing when I did a number on her bathroom. And that number was two.\nSheldon: Well, you know, I\xe2\x80\x99ve always been a fan of a story told by Attar of Nishapur, about a king who assembled a group of wise men to create a ring that would make him happy when he was sad. And that ring was inscribed with the phrase, this too shall pass.\nBarry: Hey, Cooper. I heard you dwunk-dialed Stephen Hawking last night? Classic.\nHoward: Get out of here, Barry.\nBarry: Whatever you say, Cwogziwwa.\nSheldon: Clogzilla. That\xe2\x80\x99s pretty funny. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x99s gonna pass.\nScene: Stephen Hawking\xe2\x80\x99s office.\nAnswerphone: Next message.\nSheldon (voice): It\xe2\x80\x99s me again. I gave up string theory. You should give up black holes, and we can totally solve crimes together.\nAnswerphone: Next message.\nSheldon (voice): Do you know what\xe2\x80\x99s great? Geology. Oh. Look at this geode. That\xe2\x80\x99s fun to say. Gee-ode. Gee-ode.\nAnswerphone: Next message.\nSheldon (voice): Gee-ode. Gee-ode. I kiss girls now.\nAnswerphone: Next message.\nSheldon (voice): Hey, guess who I am. Beep bop boop bop. I\xe2\x80\x99m you. Get it?\nAnswerphone: Next message.\nSheldon (voice): Are you mad at me? Oh, no, you\xe2\x80\x99re mad at me. I\xe2\x80\x99m so sorry. Beep bop boop bop.\nAnswerphone: Next message.\nSheldon (voice): Thiospinel sulfide. Thiospinel sulfide. That\xe2\x80\x99s even more fun than gee-ode. Hey, did you see The Lego Movie?\nStephen Hawking: What a jackass.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
