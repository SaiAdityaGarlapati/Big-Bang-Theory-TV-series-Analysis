b'Following a \xe2\x80\x9cpreviously on\xe2\x80\x9d sequence.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Look at this. Elon Musk has a theory that we\xe2\x80\x99re all just characters in some advanced civilization\xe2\x80\x99s video game.\nLeonard: So some alien kid spent his money on the asthma-and-glasses upgrade for me?\nSheldon: Well, he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t say it\xe2\x80\x99s a good game.\nHoward (entering): All right, we got a problem.\nLeonard: What\xe2\x80\x99s up?\nHoward: The Air Force contacted me about our quantum gyroscope. They want to have a meeting.\nLeonard: Really?\nRaj: Yeah. This military guy showed up at Howard\xe2\x80\x99s door. He was terrifying.\nSheldon: Oh, what did he say?\nRaj: He gave me his business card and asked me to please pass it along to Howard.\nSheldon: That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t sound terrifying.\nRaj: To a white guy born here, no. If you are a brown guy whose name has a lot of syllables in it, terrifying.\nLeonard: You realize if the military declares our research classified, they can take the whole thing away from us.\nHoward: And if that happens, we\xe2\x80\x99ll never be able to sell it commercially.\nLeonard: There goes our big payday.\nHoward: I was counting on that money. I need to make as much as my wife so I don\xe2\x80\x99t have to try so hard in bed.\nLeonard: You do that, too?\nHoward: Oh, yeah. How do you think I stay this thin?\nSheldon: Gentlemen, I think we are losing sight of the real issue. We are on the precipice of becoming faceless cogs in the military-industrial complex. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that exciting?\nRaj: Well, you\xe2\x80\x99re kidding, right?\nSheldon: Not at all. In Star Wars, when the stormtroopers would march in perfect formation, harassing civilians, didn\xe2\x80\x99t you ever think, hey, that could be me?\nHoward: Sheldon, we could be contributing to a weapons system that oppresses mankind for the next thousand years.\nSheldon: Okay, Howard\xe2\x80\x99s on board. What do you think, Leonard?\nCredits sequence.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nBernadette: I\xe2\x80\x99m worried about Howard. Ever since that guy from the Air Force showed up, he\xe2\x80\x99s been a nervous wreck.\nPenny: All right, we work at a giant pharmaceutical company. Get him some anti-anxiety meds.\nBernadette: He won\xe2\x80\x99t take any pills that aren\xe2\x80\x99t chewable and shaped like a Flintstone.\nPenny: You know, when Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s feeling anxious I make him take a long walk.\nAmy: Does that help?\nPenny: Well, for a while. Then he comes back.\nBernadette: I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe this.\nAmy: What\xe2\x80\x99s wrong?\nBernadette: This guy from the office just congratulated me on being pregnant.\nAmy: You did already know, right?\nBernadette: No one at the office did. Did you tell anyone?\nPenny: No. You told me not to.\nBernadette: I bet it was Barbara Chen in retrovirus. She might have heard me throwing up one morning. Every since she got the hearing aid, she thinks she\xe2\x80\x99s so great.\nAmy: Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you want anyone to know?\nBernadette: \xe2\x80\x98Cause I\xe2\x80\x99m up for a major immunotherapy study, and if they find out I\xe2\x80\x99m pregnant they might give it to someone else.\nPenny: Would they really do that?\nBernadette: I know they would, they did it to Barbara Chen last year when I told everyone she was pregnant.\nScene: The apartment.\nRaj: Wail till I Snapchat that my friends might be working on a top secret government project.\nLeonard: Are you crazy? You can\xe2\x80\x99t put that on Snapchat.\nRaj: Fine, I\xe2\x80\x99ll put it on Facebook like a caveman.\nHoward: You know, maybe before our meeting we should talk to a lawyer.\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99s not a bad idea.\nRaj: Well, you must have someone in your family that\xe2\x80\x99s a lawyer.\nHoward: Why? Because I\xe2\x80\x99m Jewish? That\xe2\x80\x99s like me saying, hey, you\xe2\x80\x99re Indian, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t your cousin work in a call centre?\nRaj: My cousin does work in a call centre.\nHoward: And my cousin\xe2\x80\x99s a lawyer.\nSheldon: We don\xe2\x80\x99t need Howard\xe2\x80\x99s cousin. No, we have me.\nLeonard: You\xe2\x80\x99re not a lawyer, Sheldon, you\xe2\x80\x99re just a know-it-all.\nSheldon: I am not a know-it-all. I\xe2\x80\x99m a person who knows lots of things and likes to correct other people when they\xe2\x80\x99re wrong.\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99s the definition of being a know-it-all.\nSheldon: Or in German, a Besserwisser.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nPenny: How did you think you were gonna hide your pregnancy?\nBernadette: I had a plan. I kept leaving Dove Bar wrappers around to explain any weight gain.\nAmy: Where did you get empty Dove Bar wrappers?\nBernadette: From all the Dove Bars I ate. I\xe2\x80\x99m pregnant. Try to keep up. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, I have to go find out if my boss knows.\nAmy: Well, whatever happens, we\xe2\x80\x99re here for you.\nBernadette: Thanks. You guys are the best.\nPenny: Yeah, drive safe. We love you. And give us a call\xe2\x80\xa6 Oh, my God, it was me, it was me. I\xe2\x80\x99m the one who blabbed she was pregnant!\nAmy: What?\nPenny: I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to. It just slipped out in front of her assistantone day. I\xe2\x80\xa6\nBernadette: I forgot my coat.\nPenny: Oh, here\xe2\x80\x99s your coat, honey. That\xe2\x80\x99s such a cute jacket. Oh God, I feel so bad, I just lied to her.\nAmy: Oh, but you did it so well. That\xe2\x80\x99s amazing, it\xe2\x80\x99s like watching a sculptor, but your clay was lies.\nPenny: Is that really what\xe2\x80\x99s important right now?\nAmy: I mean, seriously, you have got to let me scan your brain when you\xe2\x80\x99re being dishonest so I can see what lights up.\nPenny: That\xe2\x80\x99s super helpful, Amy. Thanks a lot. I can\xe2\x80\x99t wait to do that.\nAmy: I can see a clump of bitch cells lightin\xe2\x80\x99 up from here.\nScene: Howard\xe2\x80\x99s workshop.\nHoward: Give me a second to call my cousin.\nSheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t see how a tax lawyer from Fort Lauderdale could be helpful regarding intellectual property.\nHoward: First of all, he\xe2\x80\x99s in Boca Raton, which is better than Fort Lauderdale. But more importantly, he lasted two days on Jeopardy, so he\xe2\x80\x99s clearly a smart guy.\nHoward\xe2\x80\x99s cousin (on skype): Hello.\nHoward: Hey, Marty. Thanks for talking to us.\nMarty: Hey, no problem. Thanks for going to outer space so no matter what I do my mom will be disappointed in me.\nHoward: Well, I married a little Catholic girl, so we\xe2\x80\x99re even. Anyway, this is Leonard and Sheldon. The three of us came up with the guidance system.\nLeonard: Hi.\nSheldon: Hello.\nHoward: And this is my friend, Raj.\nRaj: Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m not on the patent. I\xe2\x80\x99m just here because there\xe2\x80\x99s a bumblebee in my office.\nLeonard: I saw it. It\xe2\x80\x99s big.\nHoward: Anyway, like I said in the e-mail, this meeting\xe2\x80\x99s on Thursday. Do you have any advice for us?\nMarty: Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know much about patent law. But, uh, my advice is hear them out, offer as little information as possible, and whatever you do, don\xe2\x80\x99t sign anything.\nSheldon: Don\xe2\x80\x99t sign anything? That\xe2\x80\x99s your advice? Okay, so, uh, if during this meeting, one of us were to, say, complete an oil painting, you\xe2\x80\x99d recommend that we leave that unsigned?\nMarty: That\xe2\x80\x99s not what I meant.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s what you said.\nMarty: That\xe2\x80\x99s not what I meant.\nSheldon: This must be how you practice law in Boca Raton, by saying things you don\xe2\x80\x99t mean and meaning things you don\xe2\x80\x99t say.\nMarty: Howard, why is he yelling at me?\nSheldon: All right, you were on Jeopardy. Allow me to Alex Trebek this and put it in the form of a question: Who has been a complete waste of our time?\nHoward: Marty, let me call you back.\nLeonard: Someday, when I\xe2\x80\x99m up on murder charges, you\xe2\x80\x99ll be hearing from me.\nSheldon: You don\xe2\x80\x99t need him. I\xe2\x80\x99ll represent you.\nScene: Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s office.\nPenny: Hi.\nBernadette: Hey. What brings you by?\nPenny: Oh, had to go to a sales seminar on our new sleeping pill.\nBernadette: Oh. How was it?\nPenny: Great.\nBernadette: Fell asleep?\nPenny: In, like, two minutes. Yeah. So, how is everything going around here? Are you still upset about people finding out you\xe2\x80\x99re pregnant?\nBernadette: I\xe2\x80\x99m furious.\nPenny: Sure, sure. Uh, did you ever figure out who told?\nBernadette: No. I confronted Barbara Chen, but she claimed she didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what I was talking about.\nPenny: Hmm. Well, I guess it\xe2\x80\x99s just gonna remain a mystery, you know, like whatever happened in that seminar after they dimmed the lights.\nBernadette: It had to be Barbara. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been trying to figure out a way to get back at her. Do you think using her work computer to Google how to be a prostitute is over the line?\nPenny: Uh, you know, when I was in high school, there was this girl who was talking about me behind my back, so me and all my friends, we cornered her in the bathroom and forgave her.\nBernadette: What kind of revenge is that? This woman screwed with my job. She\xe2\x80\x99s got to pay.\nPenny: Okay, all right, honey, you know what? There was something I was too scared to tell you yesterday, and now I\xe2\x80\x99m just balls-out terrified to tell you, but the truth is it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t Barbara Chen, it was me. I\xe2\x80\x99m the reason everyone knows.\nBernadette: Why did you do that?\nPenny: Well, it was an accident.I am so sorry I lied.\nBernadette: Get out.\nPenny: Oh, you know, I also lied about the girl in the bathroom. Yeah, we actually dumped her retainer in the toilet and put it back in her mouth.\nScene: Howard\xe2\x80\x99s workshop.\nSheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand why I can\xe2\x80\x99t talk at this meeting.\nLeonard: \xe2\x80\x98Cause when you talk, it enrages people.\nSheldon: Okay. Quick question. Am I allowed to exchange pleasantries upon meeting this colonel?\nLeonard: Yes.\nSheldon: Am I allowed to inform him that Colonel Sanders was never actually in the military?\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m getting enraged.\nSheldon: Fine. Ooh. Can I use text-to-speech software?\nHoward: No.\nLeonard: Don\xe2\x80\x99t speak.\nSheldon\xe2\x80\x99s phone: Aw, nuts.\nColonel Williams: Gentlemen, I\xe2\x80\x99m Colonel Williams. Thank you for meeting with me.\nLeonard: Hi.\nHoward: Hello.\nColonel Williams: So, which one of you is the brains behind all this?\nHoward: It\xe2\x80\x99s a group effort, but I guess if we had to pick a main brain, it would be me.\nSheldon: (Strangled sound)\nScene: The same, shortly after, demonstrating the quantum gyroscope.\nColonel Williams: And because of the quantum vortices, this can run perpetually?\nLeonard: Exactly. Yeah, you have a good grasp of the physics.\nColonel Williams: Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m a scientist by training.\nHoward: Really? You\xe2\x80\x99re a physicist?\nColonel Williams: Better. I\xe2\x80\x99m an engineer.\nLeonard: Where did you go to school?\nColonel Williams: MIT.\nHoward: Oh. Well, hey, me, too.\nColonel Williams: I should have known. Behind every great invention is an MIT mind. I\xe2\x80\x99ll cut to the chase. The Air Force believes there\xe2\x80\x99s an application for this technology, and we\xe2\x80\x99re interested in funding your research.\nHoward: Well, thanks, but you should know we\xe2\x80\x99re a little concerned about this being used in weapons.\nColonel Williams: Oh, well, let me put your mind at ease. What we use it for is none of your business.\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how I feel about this.\nColonel Williams: Look, guys, it\xe2\x80\x99s just a guidance system. It\xe2\x80\x99s not like you\xe2\x80\x99re handing us the Death Star from Star Trek. All you need to worry about is, right now, it\xe2\x80\x99s this big, and we need it to be this big.\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99s a lot less big.\nColonel Williams: Yes, it\xe2\x80\x99s this much less big.\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m not even sure that\xe2\x80\x99s possible.\nColonel Williams: Well, I ran it by some colleagues at MIT, and they thought they could get it done in four months.\nHoward: Four months?\nSheldon: Yeah, we\xe2\x80\x99ll do it in two. Hi. I\xe2\x80\x99m Dr. Sheldon Cooper. I\xe2\x80\x99m the actual brains behind this project. Also, engineers aren\xe2\x80\x99t real scientists, MIT\xe2\x80\x99s a trade school, and the Death Star is from Star Wars, not Star Trek. But otherwise, thank you for your service.\nScene: Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s office.\nAmy: Hi. Howard told me you were working late, so I brought dinner.\nBernadette: Oh, thanks. You know, I just wanted to get some work done without people congratulating me about the baby every five minutes.\nAmy: I spent my day alone in the lab waiting for a rat to die of anthrax.\nBernadette: Did you come here to bring me dinner or to gloat?\nAmy: Well, I came to see how you were feeling, but I\xe2\x80\x99m guessing still angry?\nBernadette: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. My boss wants to meet with me, and I\xe2\x80\x99m stressing.\nAmy: You really think they\xe2\x80\x99re gonna start treating you differently?\nBernadette: Are you kidding? I\xe2\x80\x99ve always been treated differently. Look at me. Listen to me. I mean, the first thought when you see me isn\xe2\x80\x99t that\xe2\x80\x99s a scientist, it\xe2\x80\x99s I wonder if her mommy\nknows where she is.\nAmy: I am really regretting that I got you a Happy Meal.\nBernadette: I\xe2\x80\x99ve worked so hard to get where I am, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get sent back to square one because I\xe2\x80\x99m pregnant.\nAmy: I understand how you feel.\nBernadette: Thank you.\nAmy: I wish there were some way I could make it better.\nBernadette: Well, you brought me French fries. That\xe2\x80\x99s a start.\nAmy: Uh, actually, I got you apple slices \xe2\x80\x99cause you\xe2\x80\x99re pregnant.\nBernadette: Apple slices? What kind of lunatic goes to McDonald\xe2\x80\x99s and gets fruit?\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99ll be right back.\nBernadette: And a chocolate shake.\nScene: The apartment.\nPenny: Hi.\nSheldon: Hello.\nPenny: What are you doing?\nSheldon: Oh, Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s mad at me, so I\xe2\x80\x99m making him lemon bars.\nPenny: Does he even like lemon bars?\nSheldon: Not really. But I\xe2\x80\x99m mad at him, too, so lemon bars it is.\nPenny: Something happen at the meeting?\nSheldon: They made me promise I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t talk.\nPenny: And you talked?\nSheldon: Well, now, see? You knew what was gonna happen. Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t they? Anyway, now we\xe2\x80\x99re committed to completing this project in a ridiculously short time frame, and everyone\xe2\x80\x99s upset with me.\nPenny: Well, if it makes you feel any better, Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s mad at me, too.\nSheldon: Mm. If it makes you feel any better, a parasitoid wasp known as Oobius depressus has been rediscovered after 101 years of presumed extinction.\nPenny: Why would that make me feel better?\nSheldon: Why would your Bernadette thing make me feel better? At least mine was educational.\nPenny: Okay. Never mind.\nSheldon: Look, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. Tell me why Bernadette is upset with you.\nPenny: Well, I told people at work that she\xe2\x80\x99s pregnant. She wasn\xe2\x80\x99t ready for them to know.\nSheldon: Why would you do that?\nPenny: Well, it just slipped out. I feel terrible.\nSheldon: See, that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what happened to me, except that I said it on purpose, and I have no regrets.\nScene: Howard\xe2\x80\x99s workshop.\nRaj: Is it even possible to get this done in two months?\nHoward: Well, maybe. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. We\xe2\x80\x99ll have to work 12 hours a day, seven days a week.\nLeonard: Which means I won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to make Penny breakfast every day, and she\xe2\x80\x99ll realize my brioche French toast was the only thing keeping her in the marriage.\nHoward: I love your French toast.\nLeonard: Oh, thanks, man.\nRaj: So, why did you guys even agree to the deadline?\nHoward: We didn\xe2\x80\x99t. Sheldon did.\nRaj: And you just let him?\nLeonard: Well, the colonel said it was for the good of the country, and the funding is substantial.\nHoward: No, but mostly, there was an awkward pause, and I broke it by saying okay.\nRaj: So I guess I won\xe2\x80\x99t be seeing you guys for a while.\nLeonard: Oh, looks like it.\nRaj: Wow. You\xe2\x80\x99re going off to work with the military, leaving me behind. Now I know how all those army wives feel.\nHoward: Would you stop? We\xe2\x80\x99re just gonna be on the other side of campus.\nRaj: And right here.\nHoward: You are a deeply silly man.\nRaj: He is so afraid of his feelings.\nScene: Outside Penny\xe2\x80\x99s door.\nPenny: Oh, hi.\nBernadette: Got a minute?\nPenny: Yeah, come on in.\nBernadette: I just wanted to apologize. I know what you did was an accident.\nPenny: Oh, thank you, and I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry I lied about it.\nBernadette: For what it\xe2\x80\x99s worth, you\xe2\x80\x99re a great liar.\nPenny: Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s what Amy said. So what\xe2\x80\x99s going on with the research project? Are they gonna let you run it?\nBernadette: Well, my boss said he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t decided yet, so I gently reminded him that he\xe2\x80\x99s an old rich white guy, and I\xe2\x80\x99m a sweet little pregnant lady who\xe2\x80\x99s not afraid to crying front of a jury.\nPenny: You threatened to sue?\nBernadette: Hey, I learned a long time ago, when you\xe2\x80\x99re four feet eleven and eye level with every guy\xe2\x80\x99s crotch, that\xe2\x80\x99s where you punch.\nPenny: That\xe2\x80\x99s funny. I learned something totally different.\nBernadette: Do you know what? It\xe2\x80\x99s just a research project. The most important job in the world is gonna be raising this child. It\xe2\x80\x99s all I need to give my life meaning.\nPenny: Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s so beautiful.\nBernadette: You believe me? Oh, good. 11 more chumps like you, I\xe2\x80\x99ll have the jury eating out of my hand.\nScene: A corridor at the university.\nSheldon: I never realized this building was classified.\nHoward: Maybe that\xe2\x80\x99s because it\xe2\x80\x99s classified.\nLeonard: Wish we weren\xe2\x80\x99t so far from my parking space.\nSheldon: The way you put away those lemon bars, perhaps that\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99d like to reinstate the you-not-talking rule.\nSheldon: Why? It clearly doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work.\nHoward: I guess this is it.\nLeonard: Is that a retinal scanner?\nHoward: Let\xe2\x80\x99s find out.\nScanner: Howard Wolowitz, access granted.\nLeonard: No way.\nSheldon: Impressive.\nLeonard: Oh, my turn, my turn.\nScanner: Leonard Hofstadter, access granted.\nLeonard: I didn\xe2\x80\x99t even have to take my glasses off/\nScanner (as Leonard and Sheldon try to fool it with one eye each): Access denied.\nLeonard and Sheldon: It knows.\nHoward: Oh, oh, oh, oh, guys, hold me upside down.\nScanner: Howard Wolowitz, access granted.\nAll: Yay.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
