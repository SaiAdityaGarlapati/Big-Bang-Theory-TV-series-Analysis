b'Scene: Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nBernadette: And the next wedding gift is a gravy boat.\nPenny: Ooh, one gravy boat.\nAmy: That\xe2\x80\x99s from Sheldon. He told me he had it engraved.\nBernadette: In the event of a divorce, please return to Sheldon Cooper.\nPenny: One inappropriate, yet I wish I thought of that gravy boat.\nAmy: When I get married I\xe2\x80\x99m going to register at the UCLA Cadaver Lab.\nPenny: Ew, why?\nAmy: \xe2\x80\x98Cause I\xe2\x80\x99ve always wanted a whole human skeleton and they are really spendy.\nBernadette: So, you actually see you and Sheldon getting married someday?\nAmy: Not just someday. In exactly four years. But don\xe2\x80\x99t tell Sheldon. He\xe2\x80\x99s still a flight risk.\nBernadette: What about you, Penny?\nPenny: What about me what?\nBernadette: Do you think you and Leonard might ever get married?\nPenny: Oh, well, you know, Leonard is great.\nBernadette: But do you think you\xe2\x80\x99ll ever get married?\nPenny: He\xe2\x80\x99s a sweetie.\nAmy: You\xe2\x80\x99re not answering the question. Do you love him?\nPenny: Yeah, sure, of course I love him.\nBernadette: It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t sound like it.\nPenny: Well, I do.\nBernadette: Do you tell him that?\nPenny: No, he\xe2\x80\x99d just take it the wrong way.\nAmy: What does that mean?\nPenny: It means he is special and smart and nice and\xe2\x80\xa6\nBernadette: Are you gonna break up with him?\nPenny: No. Maybe. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\nBernadette: I had no idea you were unhappy.\nPenny: That\xe2\x80\x99s the thing, I\xe2\x80\x99m not. I\xe2\x80\x99m not unhappy at all. It\xe2\x80\x99s just, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, I, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been in love before, but it felt different. But maybe this is a new, better, boring kind of love. Do you ever feel that way about Howard?\nBernadette: Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s not really a fair comparison. I\xe2\x80\x99m basically married to a sexy Buzz Lightyear.\nPenny: Amy, you?\nAmy: Can\xe2\x80\x99t help ya, kid. Whenever I\xe2\x80\x99m around Sheldon, I feel like my loins are on fire. In the good way. Not the urinary tract infection way.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: Cutting between the International Space Station and the apartment (the guys are on webcam).\nRaj (voice off): Hey, buddy, how\xe2\x80\x99s it going up there?\nHoward: You don\xe2\x80\x99t have to shout, Raj. It\xe2\x80\x99s not like I\xe2\x80\x99m an astronaut floating around in outer space. Oh, wait, I am.\nLeonard: So, is it everything you hoped it would be?\nHoward: It\xe2\x80\x99s better. I wake up every morning and I just can\xe2\x80\x99t believe I\xe2\x80\x99m on this incredible adventure.\nDimitri: Hey, Froot Loops, did you clean the space toilet?\nHoward: Excuse me. I\xe2\x80\x99m talking to my friends.\nMike: You know the rules, new guy scrubs the toilet.\nDimitri: If you do good job, next time we give you brush.\nHoward: Funny. We\xe2\x80\x99re always giving each other a hard time up here. It\xe2\x80\x99s kind of like being in a frat. You know, joking, kidding around, hurting feelings.\nSheldon: Okay, my turn. Let me talk to him.\nLeonard: Go ahead.\nSheldon: 2311 North Los Robles Avenue, Pasadena, California to International Space Station. Can you read me? Over. (Makes static noise)\nHoward: Yes, I read you, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Copy that. Over. (Static noise)\nLeonard: What are you doing?\nSheldon: I am talking to a man in space. If you don\xe2\x80\x99t have the (static noise) then he might as well be at the Coffee Bean over on Lake Street.\nHoward: You\xe2\x80\x99re out of your mind,Sheldon.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s a negative. My mother had me tested. Over. (Static noise)\nMike: Come on, scrub it up, Loops.\nHoward: All right, all right. I gotta go. There\xe2\x80\x99s a meteor shower.\nMike: You want to see a meteor shower? Take a look at what Dimitri just left you in the toilet.\nHoward: Bye.\nSheldon: Over and out. (Static noise)\nRaj: Bye, buddy!\nStuart (knocking and entering): Hello.\nRaj: Hey, Stuart, come on in.\nSheldon: What are you doing here?\nStuart: Um, Raj invited me to go to the movies with you guys.\nSheldon: Excuse me. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t authorize this.\nLeonard: Sheldon, you are not in charge.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s mighty sassy for a man with a roommate performance review around the corner.\nRaj: What\xe2\x80\x99s the big deal? You guys are bringing your girlfriends. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to sit by myself.\nSheldon: The big deal is I was expecting us to be an intimate group of five. Now, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be a faceless mass of six.\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99ll be fine. Just, uh, pretend he\xe2\x80\x99s Wolowitz.\nSheldon: Hmm. Do you like Raisinets?\nStuart: I can take them or leave them.\nSheldon: At the movies, Wolowitz always eats Raisinets.\nStuart: Would you feel more comfortable if I ate Raisinets?\nSheldon: Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s hardly my business what you eat, as long as it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t crunch during the film and it\xe2\x80\x99s Raisinets.\nStuart: Okay. Should we go?\nSheldon: Yuh-uh, one more question, if you\xe2\x80\x99re going to replace Wolowitz, I need to know a little more about you.\nStuart: All right.\nSheldon: Wolowitz went to MIT. What\xe2\x80\x99s your educational background?\nStuart: I went to art school.\nSheldon: Equally ridiculous. Let\xe2\x80\x99s go.\nScene: The cinema.\nSheldon: This insistence on hand-holding is preposterous.\nAmy: Well, I like it.\nSheldon: Yeah, of course you do. You\xe2\x80\x99re a girl. You like all kinds of hippy-dippy things.\nAmy: Just watch the movie.\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s not fair. Penny isn\xe2\x80\x99t making Leonard hold hands.\nAmy: There might be a reason for that.\nSheldon: Sweaty? Unhygienic? Looks dumb? Take your pick.\nAmy: Penny said she\xe2\x80\x99s not sure she wants to be Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s girlfriend anymore.\nSheldon: Wrong. She just took a sip from his Diet Dr. Pepper.\nAmy: So?\nSheldon: So, if she wants to end her pair-bond with Leonard, why on earth would she guzzle a witches\xe2\x80\x99 brew of his soda and spit?\nAmy: It\xe2\x80\x99s complicated.\nSheldon: String theory is complicated. That\xe2\x80\x99s just yucky. Don\xe2\x80\x99t get any ideas. All right, for the sake of argument, let\xe2\x80\x99s say that\xe2\x80\x99s true. Why doesn\xe2\x80\x99t Penny just end the relationship?\nAmy: She\xe2\x80\x99s not sure how she feels.\nSheldon: How can she not be sure how she feels? You know, when I have a feeling, I know it. Trains? Love them. Swordfish? I love them, too. They\xe2\x80\x99re fish with a sword for a nose.\nAmy: Regardless, don\xe2\x80\x99t say anything to Leonard.\nSheldon: Now you\xe2\x80\x99re asking me to keep a secret from my best friend, colleague, and roommate?\nAmy: Yes, please, Penny will kill me.\nSheldon: Uh, fine. FYI, secret-keeping? Hate it. Hand-holding? Not a fan. Hammerhead shark? I love that thing. Yeah, it\xe2\x80\x99s another fish with a tool on its head.\nStuart: Raisinet?\nSheldon: Shh, we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to watch the movie. This is not working out with him.\nScene: The apartment. Sheldon is making a sucking noise with his teeth.\nLeonard: What are you doing?\nSheldon: I think I might have tartar buildup. My tongue won\xe2\x80\x99t go as far forward as it used to.\nLeonard: Maybe your tongue is shrinking.\nSheldon (measures): Nope. Oh, you have no idea how annoying this is.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m starting to get a sense of it. Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry. I\xe2\x80\x99ll take you to the dentist tomorrow.\nSheldon: Thank you. I appreciate that. You\xe2\x80\x99re good people, Leonard. There\xe2\x80\x99s something I need to tell you.\nLeonard: Okay.\nSheldon: I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell you.\nLeonard: Why?\nSheldon: I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell you why I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell you. So I guess there\xe2\x80\x99s two things I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell you.\nLeonard: I wish there were more.\nSheldon: Good night. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. This is really important.\nLeonard: What is it?\nSheldon: I like The Transformers. Do you like The Transformers?\nLeonard: Where exactly did your mother have you tested?\nSheldon: Leonard, the Transformers teach us that things are not always what they appear to be. You know, like, uh, a semi truck might be an alien robot, or, uh, someone in a romantic relationship, uh, might feel differently than they appear to. Or a conversation about The Transformers might actually be about someone in this room. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to pause to let that sink in.\nLeonard: Okay, I think I understand.\nSheldon: You do?\nLeonard: The guy who seems like an emotionless robot is you, but your relationship with Amy is causing you to transform into a red-blooded man with sexual desires.\nSheldon: That is literally the stupidest thing I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever heard.\nScene: Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s room.\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard? (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard? (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard?\nLeonard: What?\nSheldon: Are you sleeping?\nLeonard: I was. Now I\xe2\x80\x99m having a nightmare. What do you want?\nSheldon: Never mind. I still can\xe2\x80\x99t tell you.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom. Sheldon is standing over Penny\xe2\x80\x99s bed, knocking on the wall.\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Penny? (Knock, knock, knock) Penny? (Knock, knock, knock) Penny? (Penny wakes up and screams. Sheldon also screams)\nPenny: Oh, my God. Sheldon?\nSheldon: You frightened me.\nPenny: What are you doing in my bedroom?\nSheldon: Yeah, well, I knocked on the front door, but you didn\xe2\x80\x99t hear it.\nPenny: How did you even get in, you weirdo?\nSheldon: Yeah, really? I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen strange men traipsing in and out of here for years, but when I do it, it\xe2\x80\x99s weird?\nPenny: What do you want, Sheldon?\nSheldon: Oh, I was having a little trouble sleeping and I just thought, uh, seeing as you\xe2\x80\x99re up, we could talk.\nPenny: Talk about what?\nSheldon: Oh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, uh, weather, uh, fish you could do carpentry with, why Leonard is such an attractive and desirable boyfriend. Yeah, pick one, your choice.\nPenny: Sheldon.\nSheldon: Did you know that Leonard has a perfect driving record and enjoys the insurance discounts that go along with that? Hubba-hubba.\nPenny: Okay, go home, crazy man.\nSheldon: Yeah. Did you know that while Leonard is not considered a tall fellow in our country, in today\xe2\x80\x99s North Korea, he\xe2\x80\x99s downright average. Hey, talk about a keeper.\nPenny: Okay, what did Amy tell you?\nSheldon: Oh, very well. I can\xe2\x80\x99t keep up this clever charade any longer. She told me that you were thinking of ending it with Leonard.\nPenny: Okay, you listen to me. I think it\xe2\x80\x99s really sweet you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to protect your friend, but this is none of your business. Got it?\nSheldon: Excuse me. This is not about protecting my friend. I\xe2\x80\x99m a big fan of homeostasis. Do you know what that is?\nPenny: Of course not.\nSheldon: Homeostasis refers to a system\xe2\x80\x99s ability to regulate its internal environment and maintain a constant condition of properties like temperature or pH.\nPenny: Worst bedtime story ever.\nSheldon: My point is I don\xe2\x80\x99t like when things change. So, regardless of your feelings, I would like you to continue dating Leonard. And also, while we\xe2\x80\x99re on the subject, you recently changed your shampoo. I\xe2\x80\x99m not comfortable with the new scent. Please stop this madness and go back to green apple.\nPenny: Okay, honey, I have a lot to figure out, and until I do, you are not to say a word to Leonard. Do you understand?\nSheldon: I do. You clear on the shampoo issue?\nPenny: Get out.\nSheldon: Penny?\nPenny: What?\nSheldon: Please don\xe2\x80\x99t hurt my friend.\nPenny: That is the last thing I want to do.\nSheldon: Thank you. Coconut? What were you thinking? Are you a hula girl?\nPenny: Get out.\nScene: Amy\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom. Phone rings.\nAmy: Hello?\nPenny: What the hell is wrong with you? You told Sheldon? Do you know what a terrible position this puts me in? (Phone beeps)\nAmy: Hang on, please. Hello?\nSheldon: Yeah, just a heads-up: Penny knows that you blabbed about Leonard. She\xe2\x80\x99s pretty mad.\nAmy: I know. She\xe2\x80\x99s yelling at me right now.\nSheldon: All right then, so we\xe2\x80\x99re all on the same page. Yes.\nScene: Cutting between the International Space Station and the Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nHoward: Hey, Bernie.\nBernadette: There\xe2\x80\x99s my hubby. How\xe2\x80\x99s everything going up there?\nHoward: Oh, it\xe2\x80\x99s okay. Space is beautiful. Earth is beautiful. Same old, same old.\nBernadette: What\xe2\x80\x99s wrong?\nHoward: Nothing. Everything\xe2\x80\x99s fine.\nBernadette: Howard.\nHoward: The other astronauts are being mean to me.\nBernadette: No, what are they doing?\nHoward: Well, like for instance, the other day when I was asleep, one of the guys went on a space walk and glued a big-eyed rubber alien mask to the outside of my window. When I woke up, I screamed for like nine minutes.\nBernadette: Oh, Howie.\nHoward: You can see it if you want. It\xe2\x80\x99s on YouTube. Google astronaut screams for nine minutes.\nBernadette: Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you stand up to them?\nHoward: What am I supposed to say?\nBernadette: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Say, being mean is lame, what\xe2\x80\x99s cool is being nice.\nHoward: Great, I\xe2\x80\x99ll do that when I want to be the first guy in space to get a wedgie.\nBernadette: Do you want me to call somebody at NASA?\nHoward: No. My mom already tried that. It only made things worse.\nScene: The apartment. The guys are playing a card game.\nLeonard: Gelatinous Sphere.\nRaj: Focused Locust.\nStuart: Temple of Yip.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. Wolowitz would never play that card.\nStuart: All right, Lesser Demon Turtle.\nSheldon: Fairy God Monster, I win. Your desperate need for friendship makes you weak.\nRaj: So, what are you guys doing later? Stuart and I were thinking of going out for a drink.\nStuart: We\xe2\x80\x99re gonna try to meet some girls.\nRaj: \xe2\x80\x98Cause that\xe2\x80\x99s what we do.\nStuart: Watch out, ladies, a little coffee and cream coming your way.\nRaj: In case you didn\xe2\x80\x99t follow that, I\xe2\x80\x99m the coffee.\nSheldon: Leonard? Maybe you\xe2\x80\x99d like to go with them to meet girls.\nLeonard: Why would I be interested? I have Penny.\nSheldon: Yeah, for now. But that woman has a death wish, Leonard. She talks to strangers, she pets unfamiliar dogs, and it is ridiculously easy to break into her apartment. If I were you, I\xe2\x80\x99d get a back-up.\nLeonard: You can\xe2\x80\x99t just replace someone you care about with some other random person.\nStuart: No, please don\xe2\x80\x99t ruin this for me.\nSheldon: Do you remember how upset I was when they replaced Edward Norton as the Hulk?\nLeonard: Yes, you walked around for a week saying, Sheldon unhappy with casting choice.\nSheldon: But, then Mark Ruffalo was the Hulk in The Avengers, and he was even better.\nLeonard: What\xe2\x80\x99s your point?\nSheldon: Call me a romantic. I like to think that your Mark Ruffalo is still out there somewhere.\nLeonard: This is ridiculous. Are we gonna play cards or not?\nStuart: I like Mark Ruffalo, too.\nSheldon: Yeah, settle down there, fake Wolowitz. No one likes a kiss-up.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nLeonard: So, I had to take Sheldon to the dentist this morning.\nPenny: Really?\nLeonard: Yup. I told him if he didn\xe2\x80\x99t bite the hygienist, I\xe2\x80\x99d take him for ice cream.\nPenny: Mmm.\nLeonard: I didn\xe2\x80\x99t have to take him for ice cream.\nPenny: Uh-huh.\nLeonard: You okay? You seem a little distracted.\nPenny: Look, there\xe2\x80\x99s something I need to tell you.\nLeonard: Oh. Yeah, okay.\nPenny: I don\xe2\x80\x99t really know how to say this.\nLeonard: Just say it.\nPenny: Okay. Here goes.\nLeonard: Mm-hmm.\nScene: Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nAmy: You slept with him?\nPenny: I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what else to do. He had those big, sad eyes.\nBernadette: Oh, sure, you had no choice.\nPenny: He looked at me like this.\nAmy: Well, if that\xe2\x80\x99s all it takes, it\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing you don\xe2\x80\x99t have a dog.\nBernadette: Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry. You\xe2\x80\x99ll have plenty of chances to break up with him. Your wedding day, your honeymoon, your 50th anniversary.\nPenny: Look, it\xe2\x80\x99s fine. We\xe2\x80\x99re not getting married, okay? We\xe2\x80\x99re keeping things, you know, homeostasis.\nAmy: It\xe2\x80\x99s so cute when she tries.\nPenny (phone text tone): It\xe2\x80\x99s from Leonard. Last night was amazing. You\xe2\x80\x99re amazing. I\xe2\x80\x99m so lucky to have you in my life. (They give him a hangdog look) Okay, stop it.\nScene: Cutting between the International Space Station and the Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nHoward: Hey, Bernie, guess what? I stood up to the other astronauts like you said and I got to tell you, last night was the first time in a week I got a good night\xe2\x80\x99s sleep. (On screen, Howard has a mouse face drawn on his face, and the words F.LOOPS on his forehead.)\nBernadette: Oh, Howie.\nHoward: What\xe2\x80\x99s wrong? You look upset.\nBernadette: Nope, this is my proud face.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
