b'Scene: The Comic Book Store\nHoward: Oh, hey, Stuart, I got you a little souvenir from my trip to space.\nStuart: Well, Howard, that\xe2\x80\x99s very nice of you.\nLeonard: Yeah, maybe. Open it first.\nHoward: It\xe2\x80\x99s my official NASA portrait.\nStuart: To Stuart, your comic book store is out of this world. Just like the guy in this picture was.\xe2\x80\x9d\nSheldon: For the record, he also thinks the Walgreens and the dry cleaners are out of this world.\nHoward: That\xe2\x80\x99s not true. At the Walgreens I was over the moon for their store-brand antacids.\nRaj: Hey, Stuart, I see you\xe2\x80\x99re getting ready for your Halloween party.\nStuart: Yeah, it\xe2\x80\x99s my annual attempt to meet women. Ninth time\xe2\x80\x99s the charm.\nRaj: Would you like me to help? I do have a certain je ne sais quois when it comes to soirees.\nStuart: Thanks, but I can\xe2\x80\x99t afford je ne sais quois. How much for just quois?\nRaj: You know, you don\xe2\x80\x99t worry about money. I\xe2\x80\x99ll take care of everything.\nStuart: Really?\nRaj: Yeah, you\xe2\x80\x99ll love it. Ain\xe2\x80\x99t no party like a Koothra-party.\nHoward: But you know what wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a party? That hotel in Kazakhstan they put you up in before the launch. I mean, it\xe2\x80\x99s your last night on Earth. You\xe2\x80\x99d think you\xe2\x80\x99d get one porn channel.\nLeonard: Have you noticed that Howard can take any topic and use it to remind you that he went to space?\nSheldon: Interesting hypothesis. Let\xe2\x80\x99s apply the scientific method, perform an experiment.\nLeonard: Okay. Hey, Howard, any thoughts on where we should get dinner?\nHoward: Anywhere but the Space Station. On a good day, dinner was a bag full of meat loaf. But, hey, you don\xe2\x80\x99t go there for the food, you go there for the view.\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s fascinating. Let me see if I can duplicate the result. Howard, I\xe2\x80\x99ve always thought the lemon was an underrated fruit. Care to weigh in?\nHoward: Not really.\nSheldon: Oh, well.\nHoward: You know, people say the Soyuz capsule was a lemon. But, hey, that baby got me to space and back.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The Cheesecake Factory Bar\nAmy: Ladies night at the Cheesecake Factory. Does it get any better than this?\nPenny: I hope so.\nAmy: Question. Do you think your husband\xe2\x80\x99s fondness for turtlenecks is an expression of longing for his missing foreskin?\nPenny: It\xe2\x80\x99s not getting any better. (Text tone) Ugh. It\xe2\x80\x99s Leonard. He wants to go costume shopping later.\nBernadette: I thought you liked Halloween.\nPenny: I do, it\xe2\x80\x99s just he wants to go to that party at the comic book store. A lot of the guys that hang out there are kind of creepy.\nBernadette: Like my husband?\nAmy: And my boyfriend?\nPenny: I\xe2\x80\x99m, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, Amy. You were saying something about Howard\xe2\x80\x99s foreskin?\nBernadette: Nice try, but you have to go to that party because we\xe2\x80\x99re going.\nPenny: Yeah, I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna go. It\xe2\x80\x99s just not my idea of a good time.\nBernadette: Leonard does thing he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like to make you happy.\nPenny: Well, yeah, he\xe2\x80\x99s my boyfriend. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that, like, his job?\nAmy: Then what\xe2\x80\x99s your job?\nPenny: Letting him make me happy.\nBernadette: I just think in relationships you get back what you put into them.\nAmy: That\xe2\x80\x99s not always true. Last night I gave Sheldon my best come-hither look, and he responded by explaining how wheat came to be cultivated.\nPenny: I guess I could probably try a little harder.\nBernadette: You could start by taking an interest in his work.\nPenny: Yeah, that\xe2\x80\x99s kind of a problem.\nAmy: Why?\nPenny: Not really clear on what he does.\nBernadette: He\xe2\x80\x99s an experimental physicist.\nPenny: Yeah, I\xe2\x80\x99m not really clear on what that means.\nAmy: He takes hypotheses and designs protocols to determine their accuracy.\nPenny: Yeah, you\xe2\x80\x99re really just making it worse.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: What kind of tea would you like?\nAmy: I think I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna try green tea mixed with lemon zinger.\nSheldon: Two tea bags in one cup? You\xe2\x80\x99re not at a rave.\nAmy: So, listen, Sheldon, I was thinking, since this is gonna be our first Halloween party as boyfriend and girlfriend, I thought it might be fun for us to go in a couples costume.\nSheldon: I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t agree more.\nAmy: Really? I find that inconsistent with everything I know about you.\nSheldon: Oh, oh, on the contrary. Couples costumes are one of the few benefits of being in a relationship. Now imagine this, you and I entering Stuart\xe2\x80\x99s party and all eyes turn to see America\xe2\x80\x99s most beloved and glamorous couple.\nAmy: Yeah?\nSheldon: R2-D2 and C-3PO. Dibs on Threepio.\nAmy: Sheldon, when I said couples costume, I meant like Romeo and Juliet or Cinderella and Prince Charming, not two robots from some silly movie I don\xe2\x80\x99t even like.\nSheldon: Okay, I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna let that slide because I know you\xe2\x80\x99re hopped up on tea bags.\nAmy: I make compromises for you all the time. Just this once, can\xe2\x80\x99t we find something that we\xe2\x80\x99re both happy with?\nSheldon: Fine. How about one of the most beguiling and influential couples of the 20th century? Hewlett and Packard. Dibs on Hewlett. What? You want to be Hewlett?\nScene: Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s laboratory.\nPenny: Anybody home?\nLeonard: Hey, what are you doing here?\nPenny: I just thought I\xe2\x80\x99d stop by and say hello.\nLeonard: Oh, what a nice surprise. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you\xe2\x80\x99ve ever seen my lab before.\nPenny: No, I know. It\xe2\x80\x99s long overdue. So, what ya doing? Better not be building a robot girlfriend.\nLeonard: No. Although Howard was making some real strides in that area until he met Bernadette.\nPenny: You\xe2\x80\x99re kidding.\nLeonard: Nope. Now the Lisatronic 3000 just sits in a box waiting for the phone to ring.\nPenny: Ooh! What\xe2\x80\x99s going on in here?\nLeonard: Oh, no, no, no, don\xe2\x80\x99t look in there.\nPenny: What, is it secret?\nLeonard: No, it\xe2\x80\x99s a nitrogen laser. It\xe2\x80\x99ll cook your eyeball like a soft-boiled egg.\nPenny: Oh. You might want to put a sign on it.\nLeonard: Sign right there.\nPenny: Ah. Danger. Sure, sure. Yeah. What\xe2\x80\x99s, what\xe2\x80\x99s that?\nLeonard: Uh, that is an integrated ion trap and time-of-flight mass spectrometer.\nPenny: Wow. High-techie-techie. What\xe2\x80\x99s this little box?\nLeonard: That is a pencil sharpener.\nPenny: Ooh, low-techie-techie. So, what are you working on right now?\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s actually pretty neat.\nPenny: Yeah?\nLeonard: Yeah. It\xe2\x80\x99s a front-projected holographic display combined with laser-based finger tracking. Here, I\xe2\x80\x99ll show you. We\xe2\x80\x99ll just put this pencil over here.\nPenny: Sharp. Thanks to the machine we saw earlier.\nLeonard: Very good. And then a laser will map the reflective surface, and voila. (A floating 3D image of the pencil appears. Leonard moves it around with his finger)\nPenny: Wow. That is amazing.\nLeonard: You know, there\xe2\x80\x99s a foundational idea in string theory that the whole universe may be a hologram.\nPenny: What do you mean? (Leonard flicks a switch. The hologram changes to a view of the planet Earth). Oh! Wow!\nLeonard: Uh-huh. Well, the holographic principle suggests that what we all experience every day in three dimensions may really (changes view to solar system) just be information (changes view to the galaxy) on a surface located at the farthest reaches of our cosmos. (Starts the galaxy spinning) So it\xe2\x80\x99s possible that our lives are really just acting out a painting on the largest canvas in the universe.\nPenny: Hmm.\nLeonard: What?\nPenny: Sometimes I forget how smart you are.\nLeonard: You should visit more often. What are you doing?\nPenny: Take off your clothes.\nLeonard: What? Here? Now?\nPenny: Yeah. You got a problem with that?\nLeonard: No, no. It\xe2\x80\x99s kind of crazy. I\xe2\x80\x99ve never fooled around in the lab before.\nPenny: Really? Never?\nLeonard: No. I did have a shot with the Lisatronic, but the extension cord wasn\xe2\x80\x99t long enough.\nScene: The cafeteria.\nRaj: Before I forget, I\xe2\x80\x99d like your opinion on the menus I\xe2\x80\x99ve prepared for the Halloween party. The theme is food that goes bump in the night.\nHoward: Creature from the Black Forest Ham Lagoon.\nRaj: On Sesame seed Bunzillas.\nSheldon: Night of the Living Garlic Bread?\nRaj: It\xe2\x80\x99s funny because bread sounds like dead.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, but these are just ordinary foods with the names bent into tortured puns. The dishes themselves are in no way Halloweenie.\nRaj: Ooh, Hallow-weenies! That\xe2\x80\x99s a good one. They\xe2\x80\x99ll pair nicely with my Draculoni and Cheese. How do I do it?\nHoward: That reminds me, I was thinking about wearing my NASA jumpsuit as a costume. But then I realized everyone would be, like, where\xe2\x80\x99s your costume? Why are you wearing your work clothes, you nut?\nLeonard: Hello, boys.\nSheldon: What are you smiling at?\nLeonard: Nothing.\nHoward: You know where\xe2\x80\x99s there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of nothing.\nAll: Space.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom.\nHoward: Boy, it\xe2\x80\x99s nice to sleep in a bed with gravity again. Did I tell you about the night my retainer floated out of my mouth and into the air lock?\nBernadette: Yeah, you mentioned it once or twice.\nHoward: So, here we are, just a couple of young newlyweds. What to do? What to do to you? Astronaut Wolowitz, reporting for booty. Preparing thrusters. We have liftoff. Are we clear to jettison that nightgown?\nBernadette: Okay, we need to talk.\nHoward: What?\nBernadette: Howie, I know you went to space. I\xe2\x80\x99m incredibly proud of you. But you might want to try and not bring it up every minute.\nHoward: I don\xe2\x80\x99t talk about it every minute.\nBernadette: Tonight at dinner you went on bout it for an hour straight.\nHoward: What was I supposed to talk about? We were eating at Johnny Rockets.\nBernadette: I\xe2\x80\x99m just saying, people are getting a little tired of it.\nHoward: So, I did this amazing thing and I\xe2\x80\x99m never allowed to mention it?\nBernadette: Of course you can. But maybe a good rule would be to wait for people to bring it up.\nHoward: Okay, no problem. It won\xe2\x80\x99t happen again.\nBernadette: I love you.\nHoward: I love you, too. I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell you how many times I dreamed I was in bed here with you when I was\xe2\x80\xa6 you know. What, I can\xe2\x80\x99t even point?\nScene: Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s lab.\nLeonard: So, basically, this is what\xe2\x80\x99s called mag-lev technology. It uses very powerful electromagnets to create a force strong enough to overcome gravity. Here, you hold this.\nPenny: Whoa! That\xe2\x80\x99s heavy.\nLeonard: Yeah. Oh, uh, you don\xe2\x80\x99t have on any jewellery, do you?\nPenny: No. Why?\nLeonard: A grad student forgot to take out one of his piercings. Now he\xe2\x80\x99s on a transplant list waiting for a nipple his size. Now watch this.\nPenny: Whoa! That is very cool.\nLeonard: Sometimes I like to turn this on and pretend I\xe2\x80\x99m the super villain Magneto.\nPenny: Getting a little less cool, Leonard.\nLeonard: But what I really am is a very smart scientist who understands the mechanics of the universe and is wearing the sexy black underwear you bought him.\nPenny: There we go.\nScene: The cafeteria.\nRaj: So, I thought the photo booth for the party could either be creepy like a mummy\xe2\x80\x99s tomb, or they also have the Tardis from Doctor Who.\nSheldon: A Tardis makes no sense. It\xe2\x80\x99s a time machine from a science-fiction show. It has nothing to do with Halloween. That being said, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t get a Tardis, you stink and your party stinks.\nRaj: Do you have a preference?\nHoward: I don\xe2\x80\x99t care. Get the Tardis.\nSheldon: Yes! This party just became a major rager.\nRaj: Oh, by the way, can I borrow your bullwhip and fedora?\nHoward: Yeah, sure, whatever.\nRaj: I was thinking of dressing up as Indiana Jones\xe2\x80\x99 mocha-skinned love child. Indian Jones.\nHoward: Clever.\nRaj: What\xe2\x80\x99s wrong with you?\nHoward: Nothing.\nRaj: Oh, Howard, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a party to plan. Don\xe2\x80\x99t make me pull it out of you.\nHoward: Okay, here it is. Bernadette said you guys are all sick of me talking about my trip to space. Is that true?\nSheldon: Yes.\nRaj: No.\nSheldon: We seem to have different approaches here. I was going for helpful honesty. I have no idea what you\xe2\x80\x99re doing.\nRaj: It\xe2\x80\x99s called being nice.\nSheldon: Okay. If you think being nice will get him to shut up, I\xe2\x80\x99ll try it.\nHoward: You know what, guys? Never mind. I just won\xe2\x80\x99t talk about the greatest achievement of my life ever again.\nSheldon: Look at that, the problem solved itself.\nLeonard: Hello, boys.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: What if we were to go as dinner table favourites salt and pepper?\nAmy: You know salt makes me retain water and my cousin William was ground to death in a pepper factory accident. How about Raggedy Ann and Andy? I loved them growing up.\nSheldon: No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think so. Those dolls represent three things I do not care for, clowns, children and raggediness. I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a lost cause.\nAmy: No. There are certain things that say to the world, I have a boyfriend, and he\xe2\x80\x99s not made up. Matching costumes, hickeys and sex tapes. Pick one.\nSheldon: What\xe2\x80\x99s a hickey?\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom. Howard and Bernadette are dressed as smurfs.\nBernadette: How do I look?\nHoward: Fine.\nBernadette: Uh-oh, is someone a little blue? Come on, Howie, that\xe2\x80\x99s like the funniest thing I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever said in my life. What do you say? You ready to go?\nHoward: To tell you the truth, I\xe2\x80\x99m not really in the mood.\nBernadette: What are you talking about? It\xe2\x80\x99ll be fun. All your friends\xe2\x80\x99ll be there.\nHoward: Yeah, some friends. They all think I\xe2\x80\x99m boring. Maybe you should go without me.\nBernadette: No, if I\xe2\x80\x99m there alone, people might think I\xe2\x80\x99m just a really short person from Avatar.\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. I just don\xe2\x80\x99t want to go.\nBernadette: Hey, I just spent the last three hours colouring myself blue. I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna be washing paint out of my Smurf for a month.\nHoward: Fine. Two weeks ago I was an astronaut.\nBernadette: Yeah, well, now you\xe2\x80\x99re a Smurf. Keep walking.\nScene: The comic book store.\nPenny: Oh, my God, you guys look adorable.\nBernadette: Thanks, so do you. Slutty cop?\nPenny: No, sexy cop. Slutty cop only came with a skirt and two badges.\nBernadette: And Albert Einstein?\nLeonard: Ja, und later she\xe2\x80\x99s going to arrest me for goink fashter zen da shpeed of light.\nPenny: I thought we said in the car, no accents?\nLeonard: Sorry, Officer.\nGirl dressed as a Witch: Hello. It\xe2\x80\x99s a great party.\nStuart: Thank you.\nWitch: The monster foods, they\xe2\x80\x99re really fun.\nStuart: Oh, yes, thank you. I like to think of fun things like that because I\xe2\x80\x99m fun. I\xe2\x80\x99m not clinically depressed at all.\nAmy: Sheldon, get in here.\nSheldon: I should\xe2\x80\x99ve picked hickey.\nStuart: Hey, hey, look at you guys!\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99m Raggedy Ann, and he\xe2\x80\x99s Raggedy C-3PO.\nSheldon: It was a compromise. I lost.\nRaj: Can you believe Stuart\xe2\x80\x99s walking around taking credit for this party?\nHoward: Who cares?\nRaj: What do you mean who cares? Look at what I pulled off here. The DJ\xe2\x80\x99s on fire, there\xe2\x80\x99s a Tardis photo booth in the back room, and, oh, my God, the food. Stuart wanted Kraft Draculoni and cheese.\nHoward: You\xe2\x80\x99re right, the party\xe2\x80\x99s fantastic. Please, tell me more. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard enough about it all week because hearing about that never gets old.\nRaj: Is this about the space thing again?\nHoward: Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not allowed to talk about it, but since you brought it up, I went to space! Space, space! Space! Space, space! Space!\nBernadette: Whoa, Drinky Smurf. Can I talk to you for a second?\nHoward: Great, now I\xe2\x80\x99m in trouble. You happy?\nBernadette: You, out! You are being very rude.\nHoward: No, I\xe2\x80\x99m not. They\xe2\x80\x99re all being rude. And you\xe2\x80\x99re being rude.\nBernadette: Me? What did I do?\nHoward (in a squeaky voice): Oh, Howie, stop talking about space so much. Nobody likes it.\nBernadette (in a gruff voice): I don\xe2\x80\x99t sound like that.\nHoward: You\xe2\x80\x99re my wife. You\xe2\x80\x99re supposed to be on my side.\nBernadette: I\xe2\x80\x99m always on your side.\nHoward: Then why are you trying to take this away from me? Being an astronaut is the coolest thing I\xe2\x80\x99m ever gonna do. If I stop talking about it, then I\xe2\x80\x99m just\xe2\x80\xa6\nBernadette: Just what?\nHoward: Just plain old Howard Wolowitz again.\nBernadette: Plain old Howard Wolowitz is the best guy I know.\nHoward: You\xe2\x80\x99re just saying that.\nBernadette: No, I\xe2\x80\x99m not. I married him. On purpose. Come here.\nHoward: I love you.\nBernadette: I love you, too.\nPenny (emerging from Tardis): Nothing to see here. Just sexy police business.\nLeonard: Just explaining the theory of relativity. Twice.\nScene: Howard and Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom.\nBernadette: Hey, what you watching?\nHoward: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Raj sent me some video of Buzz Aldrin.\nBuzz (on video, handing Halloween candy to children): Here you go. It\xe2\x80\x99s a Milky Way. The Milky Way\xe2\x80\x99s a galaxy in space. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been in space. Here\xe2\x80\x99s a Mars bar. I\xe2\x80\x99m an astronaut. And this one\xe2\x80\x99s a Moon Pie. I walked on the Moon. What have you done?\nHoward: Okay, I get it.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
