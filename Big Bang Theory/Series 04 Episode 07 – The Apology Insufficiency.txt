b'Scene: The University Cafeteria.\nLeonard: No, seriously, I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve finally figured out my problem with women.\nSheldon: The capybara is the largest member of the rodent family.\nLeonard: What does that have to do with me and women?\nSheldon: Nothing. It was a desperate attempt to introduce an alternate topic of conversation.\nLeonard: My problem is, I don\xe2\x80\x99t project confidence. So I decided that the next time I meet a woman I think is attractive, rather than holding back and being cautious, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to assume the mantle of self-assurance.\nRaj: Oh, yeah? What\xe2\x80\x99s that look like?\nLeonard: Hi. I\xe2\x80\x99m Leonard. And you are beautiful. You pop, sparkle and buzz electric. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to pick you up at eight, show you a night you will never forget.\nRaj: Where are we going?\nHoward: Good news. I made it onto the team for the new Defence Department laser-equipped surveillance satellite.\nSheldon: Excuse me. If we\xe2\x80\x99re changing topics, I believe I have first dibs with capybara, a rodent the size of a baby hippo.\nLeonard: Congratulations Howard.\nHoward: Thanks. Listen, I have to get a security clearance, so you guys might be hearing from the FBI.\nRaj: Whoa, whoa, whoa! I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to speak to the FBI.\nLeonard: Why not?\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99m brown and I talk funny.\nHoward: They\xe2\x80\x99re just doing a background check on me.\nRaj: It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter. They\xe2\x80\x99ll find a reason to give me a one-way ticket back to Gandhi-ville. By the way, when I say that, it\xe2\x80\x99s not offensive.\nLeonard: Don\xe2\x80\x99t be ridiculous, Raj. You\xe2\x80\x99re here legally.\nRaj: Nobody cares. Do you know how long it\xe2\x80\x99s been since I got through airport security without being given a colonoscopy?\nSheldon: You know, I try very hard to make our lunch hours educational and informative, but your insistence on talking about your own lives stymies me at every turn.\nLeonard: Fine, Sheldon, tell us about your giant rodents.\nSheldon: No, you squandered your time with me, and the moment has now passed. Feast on your disappointment, much as the capybara feasts on its own waste.\nCredits sequence.\n  Scene: Raj\xe2\x80\x99s apartment. Raj is reading New Moon.\nRaj: Oh, Bella, don\xe2\x80\x99t you see? Edward\xe2\x80\x99s only pushing you away because he loves you. (Knock on door) Coming.\nWoman at Door: Dr. Koothrappali? (Raj nods) I\xe2\x80\x99m Special Agent Page, FBI. May I come in? (Nods again) I\xe2\x80\x99d like to talk to you about Howard Wolowitz. (Indicates sofa) Oh, thank you. All right. Well, how long have you known Mr. Wolowitz?\nRaj (Holds up finger to indicate he will be right back. Runs to kitchen. Tries to drink wine but bottle is empty. Looks in fridge and finds rum cake. Comes back stuffing a piece in his mouth): Rum cake?\nPage: No, thanks. Now, about Mr. Wolowitz.\nRaj: Seven years.\nPage: I see.\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99m in this country legally, you know.\nPage: I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you are. Now, to your knowledge, has Mr. Wolowitz ever committed a crime?\nRaj: Of course not. I\xe2\x80\x99m here on an H-1B visa, which means I can\xe2\x80\x99t be associated in any way with crime or criminal activity. And I\xe2\x80\x99m not.\nPage: Good. To your knowledge, does Mr. Wolowitz have any foreign contacts?\nRaj: No, just me. Oh, there it is. Here comes a cavity search.\nPage: Excuse me?\nRaj: Please don\xe2\x80\x99t send me back to India, it\xe2\x80\x99s so crowded. It\xe2\x80\x99s like the whole country is one endless Comic-Con, except everybody\xe2\x80\x99s wearing the same costume, Indian Guy.\nPage: Dr. Koothrappali, I\xe2\x80\x99m not\xe2\x80\xa6\nRaj: I love this country! The-the baseball, the freedom, the rampant morbid obesity! From California to the New York Island, I\xe2\x80\x99m a real Yankee Doodle boy!\nPage: Dr. Koothrappali, please.\nRaj: My country \xe2\x80\x99tis of thee, duh duh duh liberty, It\xe2\x80\x99s really great.\nScene: Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s lab.\nLeonard: So, when Howard said the FBI would be contacting me, I was expecting Mulder. Glad to see I got Scully.\nPage: Who?\nLeonard: Mulder and Scully. X-Files. The truth is out there. Never mind. Uh, so, what would you like to know?\nPage: You work with Mr. Wolowitz here at the university, correct?\nLeonard: Yes. Of course, we\xe2\x80\x99re in different departments. He\xe2\x80\x99s an engineer and I\xe2\x80\x99m an experimental physicist. You know, one of those guys who examines the building blocks of creation and says, Hello, maker of the universe, I see what you did there. Good one.\nPage: Right. Now, how would you characterize your relationship with Mr. Wolowitz?\nLeonard: Good. It\xe2\x80\x99s a good relationship. Of course, most of my relationships are good. Probably because I exude confidence. People are drawn to that, you know? Confidence, not exuding.\nPage: Do you know of any groups Mr. Wolowitz is a member of?\nLeonard: You are beautiful, you know that? You pop, sparkle and buzz electric. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to pick you up at eight, show you a night you will never forget.\nPage: Sounds great.\nLeonard: Really?\nPage: Yeah. Can my six-foot-two Navy SEAL husband come with us?\nLeonard: Is that, oh, my, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see the ring with my glasses off, so, look at that, I\xe2\x80\x99m starting to exude.\nScene: The apartment. There is a knock on the door.\nLeonard: Want to get that?\nSheldon: Not particularly.\nLeonard: Could you get that?\nSheldon: I suppose I could if I were asked.\nLeonard: Would you please get that?\nSheldon: Of course. Why do you have to make things so complicated?\nPage: Dr. Cooper?\nSheldon: Yes.\nPage: I\xe2\x80\x99m Special Agent Page, FBI.\nSheldon: You say you\xe2\x80\x99re Special Agent Page, FBI.\nPage: Here\xe2\x80\x99s my I.D.\nSheldon: And here is my Justice League membership card. But that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t prove I know Batman.\nPage: I just want to ask you a few questions about Howard Wolowitz.\nSheldon: Oh. All right. I doubt anyone would risk the stiff penalties for impersonating a federal officer just to ask questions about a minor league engineer with an unresolved Oedipal complex.\nPage: Thank you.\nSheldon: For the record, I truly support the FBI in the mission which is expressed through their motto?\nPage: Fidelity, bravery, integrity?\nSheldon: Correct. Now to business. 18 years ago, I sent the FBI Crime Lab samples from a bag of excrement that had been lit on fire on my front porch for fingerprinting and DNA analysis. Why haven\xe2\x80\x99t I heard back yet?\nPage: Well, the FBI Crime Lab does have a lot on its plate.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s of little comfort to a nation attempting to scrape burning feces off its shoes.\nPage: Would you mind if we talked about Mr. Wolowitz now?\nSheldon: A little, but go on.\nPage: Thank you. Would you characterize him as responsible?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m going to answer that with a visual aid. This is my nine-disc complete Lord of the Rings trilogy blu-ray set.  Mr. Wolowitz borrowed it, damaged plastic retention hub number three, and then returned it to me, hoping I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t notice. Would you characterize that as responsible?\nPage: That\xe2\x80\x99s really not the sort of thing we\xe2\x80\x99re interested in.\nSheldon: You heard me say blu-ray, right?\nPage: I did.\nSheldon: Very well. Would you be interested in knowing that Mr. Wolowitz once snuck onto my World of Warcraft account and changed the name of a certain level-80 warlock from Sheldor to Smeldor?\nPage: I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid not. Is there anything else?\nSheldon: Is there anything else? Where would you like to start? He refuses to pay fines when he\xe2\x80\x99s overdue with books I lend him. He crashed the Mars Rover while attempting to impress a woman. He recommended that I go see the third Matrix movie because it was, and I quote, just as good as the first one. If that\xe2\x80\x99s not irresponsible, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what is.\nPage: The Mars Rover?\nSheldon: Did I say Mars Rover?\nPage: You did.\nSheldon: That was actually a poorly chosen example, as it had nothing to do with me.\nPage: Yes, well, let\xe2\x80\x99s talk about it anyway.\nSheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to. Not that my disinclination to discuss the topic should be interpreted as evidence of Howard Wolowitz\xe2\x80\x99s culpability in the destruction of government property worth millions of dollars.\nPage: Thank you, Dr. Cooper. I think I have all I need.\nSheldon: Oh, good. I was afraid you were going to fixate on that Mars Rover incident.\nScene: The cafeteria.\nHoward: Hey, buddies. Guess who didn\xe2\x80\x99t get security clearance to work on the giant space laser?\nLeonard: What happened?\nHoward: Apparently, the background interviews didn\xe2\x80\x99t go well. You guys wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t know anything about that, would you?\nRaj: Well, actually, I may have gotten a little tipsy when I talked to her.\nLeonard: And I may have hit on her a little bit.\nRaj: I may have thrown up rum cake on her shoes.\nHoward: I see. Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s good to know, when I need you guys, I can always count on you to step up and ruin everything.\nLeonard: I feel awful.\nRaj: Ah, me, too.\nLeonard: To tell you the truth, I thought if anyone was going to screw things up for Howard, it\xe2\x80\x99d be Sheldon.\nSheldon: Well, your expectations have been subverted. Aha.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: What are you doing up?\nSheldon: Sleep eludes me, Leonard.\nLeonard: Really? Maybe sleep has met you before.\nSheldon: Mockery? That\xe2\x80\x99s all you have to offer?\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. Why can\xe2\x80\x99t you sleep?\nSheldon: Who knows? I haven\xe2\x80\x99t watched any scary movies recently. I\xe2\x80\x99m no longer obsessing over why the predicted mass of the quantum vacuum has little effect on the expansion of the universe. And it\xe2\x80\x99s been weeks since I took that accidental sip of Red Bull.\nLeonard: Did something happen today that\xe2\x80\x99s bothering you?\nSheldon: Well, I did mention the Mars Rover incident to that FBI agent and probably cost Howard his security clearance.\nLeonard: What?\nSheldon: But why should that keep me up?\nLeonard: Because you feel guilty?\nSheldon: Interesting. So you\xe2\x80\x99re saying my insomnia is caused by a guilty conscience.\nLeonard: Actually, you don\xe2\x80\x99t have insomnia. You\xe2\x80\x99re sleeping now.\nSheldon: Excuse me?\nLeonard: You\xe2\x80\x99re having a guilt-ridden dream.\nSheldon: Do you have any evidence to support that hypothesis?\nLeonard: How about that Gorn sitting on the couch?\nSheldon: That seems fairly conclusive. (In his bed) No, Gorn, no. That\xe2\x80\x99s where I sit.\nScene: Agent Page\xe2\x80\x99s Office.\nSheldon: Thank you for agreeing to see me, Agent Page.\nPage: Thank you for filing a complaint with my superior, Dr. Cooper. I understand you want to recant your statement about Howard Wolowitz.\nSheldon: Yes.\nPage: Was your statement untrue?\nSheldon: No.\nPage: Then I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid you can\xe2\x80\x99t withdraw it.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. I don\xe2\x80\x99t recall you saying no backsies.\nPage: Is there anything else?\nSheldon: Yes. I\xe2\x80\x99d like to offer a laudatory statement about Howard\xe2\x80\x99s many excellent qualities that I believe will tip the scales back in his favour. Howard Joel Wolowitz. H is for honesty, of which he has much. O\xe2\x80\x99s for outstanding, which he is such. W\xe2\x80\x99s for witty, he\xe2\x80\x99s quick with a joke. A\xe2\x80\x99s for artistic, his ability\xe2\x80\xa6\nPage: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, Dr. Cooper, this matter is already closed.\nSheldon: But I still have rd Joel Wolowitz left to go.\nPage: It\xe2\x80\x99s closed.\nSheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand why you people are picking on my friend, Howard, when there are much more serious security threats to pursue. For instance, when I first met Leonard, he was on the verge of giving away rocket secrets to a North Korean spy, and not one agent ever investigated that.\nPage: This is Leonard Hofstadter?\nSheldon: No, it\xe2\x80\x99s a different Leonard. He\xe2\x80\x99s Chinese, red hair, six fingers. Good-bye.\nScene: A corridor at the university.\nSheldon: Raj. Have you seen Howard?\nRaj: I think he\xe2\x80\x99s eating lunch. Uh, Sheldon, I want you to meet Neil deGrasse Tyson from the Hayden Planetarium in New York.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m quite familiar with Dr. Tyson. He\xe2\x80\x99s responsible for the demotion of Pluto from planetary status. I liked Pluto. Ergo I do not like you.\nDr Tyson: But I actually didn\xe2\x80\x99t demote Pluto. That was a vote of the International Astronomical Union.\nSheldon: If ifs and buts were candy and nuts, we\xe2\x80\x99d all have a merry Christmas. Think about that, Dr. Tyson.\nDr Tyson: Is that the guy you were telling me about?\nRaj: Oh, yeah.\nScene: The cafeteria.\nSheldon: Howard. The person at fault for you not getting a security clearance is me.\nHoward: You?\nSheldon: Yes, but before you get upset, I want you to know I went to the FBI and retracted my statement.\nHoward: And they were okay with that?\nSheldon: No. If anything, I made it worse. In any case, I have been riddled with guilt, which is causing Gorn-infested REM sleep. So, I\xe2\x80\x99m here now to say I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.\nHoward: Are you kidding me? You\xe2\x80\x99ve set my career back at least two years, and you think you can make it right with I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry?\nSheldon: Yes. I followed the social protocol. I attempted to right the wrong, and when I failed to do so I delivered a heartfelt apology. Now you say apology accepted, and I will offer you a one-time-only high five.\nHoward: Your apology is not accepted.\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re tricking me. It really is, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\nHoward: Leave me alone, Sheldon.\nDr Tyson: Dr. Cooper, I just wanted you to know I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry for the role I played in the Pluto matter.\nSheldon: Oh, shut up.\nScene: The bar of the Cheesecake Factory.\nPenny: Sheldon?\nSheldon: Hello.\nPenny: What are you doing here?\nSheldon: I have troubles, Penny. I\xe2\x80\x99ve come to pour them out to the sympathetic ear of the local barkeep.\nPenny: You know, they have a really nice bar over at the Olive Garden.\nSheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t like the Olive Garden. They treat me like family.\nPenny: Okay, Sheldon. What can I get you?\nSheldon: Alcohol.\nPenny: Could you be a little more specific?\nSheldon: Ethyl alcohol. 40 millilitres.\nPenny: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, honey, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know millilitres.\nSheldon: Ah. Blame President James \xe2\x80\x9cJimmy\xe2\x80\x9d Carter. He started America on a path to the metric system but then just gave up. He wonders why he was a one-term president.\nPenny (pouring out a shot of tequila): Would you say that\xe2\x80\x99s about 40 milliliters?\nSheldon: More or less.\nPenny: Great. (Drinks the tequila) Now, where were we?\nSheldon: I believe you were about to ask me to choose a cocktail. Fortunately, thanks to computer-savvy alcoholics, there\xe2\x80\x99s an app for that. Let\xe2\x80\x99s see. Harvey Wallbanger. Eh. Sex on the Beach. I hardly think so. Rob Roy, Silk Slipper, Mad Hatter. Ooh! I\xe2\x80\x99ll have a Rosewater Ricky.\nPenny: A what?\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99ll need pitted, brandied cherries, gin, rosewater, angostura bitters and overproofed rum. Now, first, dust the cherries with sugar, then spray them with a mixture of rum and bitters. Then ignite the rum, caramel\xe2\x80\xa6\nPenny (pouring out a shot of tequila): Here you go, one Rosewater Ricky.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s not how it looks in the picture.\nPenny: Oh, yeah, you know, every bartender makes it differently. Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you give it a try.\nSheldon: All right. To the metric system. (Knocks back drink. Spits it all back into glass.) I can\xe2\x80\x99t taste the cherries.\nPenny: All right. Sheldon, what\xe2\x80\x99s on your mind?\nSheldon: I wronged Howard, and he won\xe2\x80\x99t accept my apology.\nPenny: Oh, right, that. Yes, Leonard told me. Sorry, honey.\nSheldon: Penny, you face failure on a daily basis. How do you cope?\nPenny: I drink.\nSheldon: To drinking. (Knocks back drink and spits it out again.) Nope. Oh, if only there were some way to force Howard to accept my apology so I could escape this miasma of guilt.\nPenny: You know, sometimes stuff just happens, and there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing you can do about it. For example, Lisa Peterson hasn\xe2\x80\x99t talked to me since the 11th grade, because no matter how much you apologize, you can\xe2\x80\x99t go back and un-dry-hump someone\xe2\x80\x99s boyfriend.\nSheldon: I see. You\xe2\x80\x99re saying I\xe2\x80\x99m facing Starfleet Academy\xe2\x80\x99s unwinnable command scenario, the Kobayashi Maru.\nPenny: Exactly. Sometimes you can\xe2\x80\x99t win.\nSheldon: Captain Kirk won.\nPenny: Kirk cheated.\nSheldon: Impressive that you know that. It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to believe I\xe2\x80\x99m actually having this conversation with you.\nPenny: Right there with you.\nSheldon: Kirk beat the Kobayashi Maru by reprogramming the simulator. That\xe2\x80\x99s it.\nPenny: What?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99ll reprogram Howard.\nPenny: What? Sheldon, you can\xe2\x80\x99t reprogram people.\nSheldon: No, you can\xe2\x80\x99t reprogram people. To James Tiberius Kirk. (Drinks. Leaves. Comes back and spits it out again.)\nScene: The cafeteria.\nSheldon: Hello, all.\nRaj: Hello.\nLeonard: Hey.\nSheldon: Howard, you\xe2\x80\x99re feeling better about me today, aren\xe2\x80\x99t you?\nHoward: Not really.\nSheldon: Yes, you are. I\xe2\x80\x99m using neurolinguistic programming to modify your thought patterns.\nHoward: Oh. Go away, Sheldon.\nSheldon: There\xe2\x80\x99s a nine ninety five e-book down the drain.\nRaj: What\xe2\x80\x99s in the bag?\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s for Howard.\nHoward: Oh. Sheldon, you can\xe2\x80\x99t fix this with gifts.\nSheldon: Nevertheless, I\xe2\x80\x99ve hurt you, and whether you forgive me or not, I want you to have this.\nHoward: You\xe2\x80\x99re giving me a couch cushion?\nSheldon: No. The cushion is merely symbolic. I\xe2\x80\x99m giving you my spot on the couch.\nHoward: But you love that spot.\nSheldon: No. I love my mother. My feelings for my spot are much greater. It is the singular location in space around which revolves my entire universe. And now it\xe2\x80\x99s yours.\nRaj: Oh, my God, dude. Now you have to forgive him.\nHoward: All right. Apology accepted.\nSheldon: High five. Not too hard. Thank you.\nRaj: I haven\xe2\x80\x99t cried like this since Toy Story 3.\nScene: The apartment.\nHoward: I got to tell you, Sheldon, I understand why you chose this spot. I mean, the temperature is good, but there\xe2\x80\x99s no draft. I can see the television, but I can still talk to\xe2\x80\xa6\nSheldon: I changed my mind. Get out of my spot.\nPenny: How long?\nLeonard: 94 seconds.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
