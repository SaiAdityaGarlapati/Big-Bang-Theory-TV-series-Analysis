b'Scene: The apartment.\nAmy: Item 28, your pet name for me. Time\xe2\x80\x99s running out on this. You need to make a decision.\nSheldon: I submitted you a notarised list.\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, but Gollum and Flakey are not acceptable.\nSheldon: Well, you don\xe2\x80\x99t like Princess Corncob, you don\xe2\x80\x99t like Fester, you\xe2\x80\x99re just impossible to please.\nAmy: We\xe2\x80\x99ll come back to that one. This brings us to the final item in our annual State of the Relationship Summit. Item 29, Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s Day.\nSheldon: Ah, the worst for last. Hmm. Classic Flakey.\nAmy: Before you get upset, I believe I\xe2\x80\x99ve come up with a way for us to celebrate the occasion that we both can enjoy.\nSheldon: People usually start a meeting with a joke, but you go ahead, end with one.\nAmy: I propose we spend a weekend at a bed-and-breakfast in Napa Valley.\nSheldon: I hate every word in that sentence. Including in, at, we and a.\nAmy: Come on, Sheldon. Why not?\nSheldon: For starters, a bed-and-breakfast forces you to eat with strangers at your table.\nAmy: One step ahead of you, Bernadette and Wolowitz are going with us.\nSheldon: Oh, very well. What are the sleeping arrangements? We\xe2\x80\x99ve only been dating for three years. If we were to share a room, people might talk.\nAmy: I got you your own room.\nSheldon: What if my room has a claw-foot bathtub?\nAmy: It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t. I know it makes you feel like you\xe2\x80\x99re bathing inside a monster.\nSheldon: Look, I appreciate the effort, but I\xe2\x80\x99m still unclear how this trip is supposed to be enjoyable for me.\nAmy: We\xe2\x80\x99re going to have Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s Day dinner on a fully functioning vintage train.\nSheldon: Vintage? Be specific.\nAmy: An Alcoa FA-4 diesel locomotive leading a train of meticulously restored 1915 Pullman first-class coaches.\nSheldon: Wow. I\xe2\x80\x99m feeling the urge to hug you. And one, and two, all right, Gollum, we\xe2\x80\x99re good.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The apartment.\nBernadette: Are you sure you guys don\xe2\x80\x99t want to come with us to Napa? You could probably still get a room.\nPenny: No, I think we\xe2\x80\x99re just gonna have a quiet weekend at home.\nLeonard: Plus, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure it\xe2\x80\x99s a great idea to take Penny to where wine comes from. What? It\xe2\x80\x99s a joke. Oh, come on. We bust on each other. I wear dorky glasses, you might have a problem, it\xe2\x80\x99s all for laughs.\nPenny: That would really piss me off if I didn\xe2\x80\x99t have a buzz going on.\nSheldon: Howard, which pocket watch will you be wearing for dinner on the train?\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, what?\nSheldon: Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid if we wear the same pocket watch, it will be embarrassing.\nHoward: I don\xe2\x80\x99t own a pocket watch.\nSheldon: Oh, my. Well, then my apologies for bringing up this sore spot.\nRaj: Since you two are gonna be around for Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s, would you mind watching Cinnamon?\nPenny: You have Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s plans? Which came out sounding way more surprised than I meant. Here, let me try that again. You have Valent\xe2\x80\xa6 See? I can\xe2\x80\x99t do it.\nRaj: I don\xe2\x80\x99t have plans which is why I booked time on the big telescope that night.\nAmy: Well, an evening looking at the stars, that\xe2\x80\x99s still kind of romantic.\nRaj: Except I\xe2\x80\x99ll be alone.\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to put lipstick on a pig here. Work with me.\nLeonard: We\xe2\x80\x99d be happy to watch Cinnamon.\nPenny: Yeah.\nRaj: Thank you. Oh, and I\xe2\x80\x99d like for at least one of us to see some action, so if you guys happen to have sex, it\xe2\x80\x99s cool if she stays in the room.\nPenny: Hey, same goes for the two of you with Amy.\nScene: The Pullman dining car.\nAmy: What do you think, Sheldon?\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s magnificent. This is going to be the best Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s Day ever.\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99m so glad you like it.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m prepared to say I love it, as soon as I confirm there are no hobos aboard.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard (on phone): Okay. Raj, I got it. Bye. (To Cinnamon) That was your daddy. He wanted me to say that he misses\xe2\x80\xa6 Why am I doing this?\nPenny: Happy Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s Day.\nLeonard: Ooh, flowers and chocolates? Somebody\xe2\x80\x99s trying to get me out of my panties.\nPenny: Don\xe2\x80\x99t be surprised if you find five chocolates missing and three gross coconut ones with a bite taken out. It came that way when I bought it.\nLeonard: Got you a little something, too.\nPenny: Aw, jewellery. Oh, my God, Lakers tickets?\nLeonard: It gets better. Instead of me, you can take someone who will actually enjoy it.\nPenny: Aw. You are the best boyfriend ever.\nLeonard: Thank you. Seriously, please don\xe2\x80\x99t make me go.\nPenny: Should we take this little party to the bedroom?\nLeonard: Mm, don\xe2\x80\x99t have to, we have the whole place to ourselves.\nPenny: Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s true.\nLeonard: In fact, if you want, we can do it right here on Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s spot.\nPenny: That is the least sexy thing anyone\xe2\x80\x99s ever said to me.\nLeonard: To the bedroom.\nPenny: Yeah.\nScene: The dining car.\nWaiter: And for the entr\xc3\xa9e, tonight\xe2\x80\x99s special is a seafood risotto. Do you have any questions?\nSheldon: Uh, I do. Uh, does this train car have the original link-and-pin coupler or the Miller Hook and Platform?\nWaiter: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, I meant questions about the food.\nSheldon: Oh, of course. Um, is the seafood risotto being served on a train car with the original link-and-pin coupler or the Miller Hook and Platform?\nAmy: Uh, I think we\xe2\x80\x99re gonna need a minute.\nMan in seat behind: Fun fact, it\xe2\x80\x99s neither. They actually use the AAR type E coupler. If you listen carefully when the locomotive disconnects, you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear the characteristic click-pshht-thunk of the knuckle.\nSheldon: Get out of town.\nHoward: Fun fact, I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna jump off this train.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: Hey, Cinnamon, guess who just did it human style.\nPenny: Oh, my God.\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s a little late, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll take it.\nPenny: No, Cinnamon ate the chocolates. That\xe2\x80\x99s really bad for dogs.\nLeonard: Oh, crap. What are we gonna do?\nPenny: We gotta get her to a vet right now.\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a vet. I have a podiatrist, an optometrist, an allergist, a dermatologist, a urologist. You\xe2\x80\x99d think I\xe2\x80\x99d have a vet.\nPenny: Okay. There\xe2\x80\x99s one not far from here. Come on. Let\xe2\x80\x99s go.\nLeonard: Okay. Koothrappali was right. We should have let her watch.\nScene: The dining car.\nSheldon: Do another one, do another one.\nMan: Okay. Here\xe2\x80\x99s my impression of the Amtrak Acela barreling down the Eastern Corridor. Wch-wch-wch-wch-shhhh. Wch-wch-wch-wch-shhhh. Wch-wch-wch-wch-shhhh.\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s like there\xe2\x80\x99s a train in your mouth. Howard: Oh, yeah. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got one. Um, the Amtrak Wolverine coming into Chicago. Bwch-wch-wch-wch-wch-wch, bwch-wch-wch-wch-wch-wch. Ooo-ooo.\nMan: I\xe2\x80\x99ve been on that train. And I just was again.\nAmy: See if you guys can guess this one. Bang. Splat. Thud.\nSheldon: How many trains have you been on?\nMan: Tons. A box fell on my head at UPS six years ago. Now I just collect disability and ride trains.\nSheldon: Wow. Your life\xe2\x80\x99s amazing.\nMan: Not always. A box fell on my head at UPS six years ago. Now I just collect disability and ride trains.\nAmy: Why do I even try?\nBernadette: I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna fix this right now.\nHoward: Okay. Just make it look like an accident.\nBernadette: Excuse me. You are at Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s dinner with your girlfriend. Now get back over there and be with her.\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re right. That was insensitive of me. I have to go back to my table now. You should join us.\nMan: All right.\nBernadette: Great. Now there\xe2\x80\x99s two of \xe2\x80\x99em.\nScene: A vet\xe2\x80\x99s surgery.\nLady Vet: How much chocolate did she eat?\nPenny: A whole box.\nLeonard: Well, to be fair, you ate a lot of it before you gave it to me.\nPenny: So the point is I may have saved her life.\nVet: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, is this a joke to you?\nLeonard: No. Maybe to her.\nVet: How big a box of chocolate was it?\nPenny: Uh, something like this. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. It came free with a full tank of gas.\nLeonard: Really? Do you know how much those Lakers tickets were?\nPenny: Do you know how much gas is?\nVet: Hey.\nPenny: Sorry.\nLeonard: Sorry.\nRaj: Oh, my God, Cinnamon, are you okay? I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe you two. You do whatever it takes to save her life. If she needs new organs, I\xe2\x80\x99ll buy any dog necessary and scrap them for parts.\nVet: You\xe2\x80\x99re the owner?\nRaj: Owner, father, soul mate, and if anything happens to her, your worst nightmare.\nVet: Well, she\xe2\x80\x99s not throwing up, which is a good sign. So, I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna take her in back, put her on fluids and give her something to absorb the toxins.\nRaj: Okay. Okay, thank you. Oh, if she\xe2\x80\x99s scared, you can sing to her. She likes Katy Perry. Oh, but don\xe2\x80\x99t do Firework, that gets her all riled up.\nVet: Got it. Should have been a dentist.\nScene: The dining car.\nMan: Okay, what was the best four-ten-four U.S. Locomotive ever built?\nSheldon: Trick question. There never was one.\nMan: Or was there?\nSheldon: What?\nMan: In 1944, the Pacific Railroad built number 6131, which rearranged the drivers and cylinders, solving the problem of the Q-1, creating a duplex-drive four-four-six-four.\nSheldon: In what world is a four-four-six-four a four-ten-four?\nHoward: A world I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to live in. Seriously, I no longer want to live in this world.\nMan: Hold on to your conductor\xe2\x80\x99s hat. You crank the second and third axles, creating a pair of internal connecting rods, and boom, four-ten-four. If you think about it, the Q-2 was like the four-ten-four America never made.\nSheldon: I may never stop thinking about it. Amy, what are the odds we run into this guy?\nWaiter: Better than you think.\nMan: You know, if you ask nicely, they\xe2\x80\x99ll let you visit the engine room.\nSheldon: I never want this day to end.\nAmy: It\xe2\x80\x99s feeling like it never will.\nSheldon: Come on.\nMan: Hey, did I tell you what happened to me at UPS?\nScene: The vets surgery.\nRaj: As if Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s Day wasn\xe2\x80\x99t bad enough, you try to kill my dog? And with cheap chocolate, no less?\nPenny: It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t cheap. It was free.\nLeonard: We\xe2\x80\x99re really sorry. It was an accident.\nPenny: Yeah, we weren\xe2\x80\x99t even out of the room that long.\nLeonard: Oh, no, come on. It was a while. It was a while.\nRaj: Oh, is Cinnamon gonna be okay?\nVet: She\xe2\x80\x99s responding well. We just want to keep her a little longer for observation.\nRaj: All right. Uh, would, would it be okay for me to see her? We\xe2\x80\x99re usually in bed by now, and I want her to know that I\xe2\x80\x99m here. Yes, we sleep together, and sometimes we spoon.\nVet: It\xe2\x80\x99s okay. I sleep with my dog, too. We\xe2\x80\x99re not supposed to let people in back, but I think I can make an exception.\nRaj: Thank you.\nVet: Come on. By the way, I sang her Katy Perry.\nRaj: Oh, yeah?\nVet: And I don\xe2\x80\x99t care what that obnoxious parrot back there says. I crushed it.\nPenny: I think there\xe2\x80\x99s something going on between the two of them.\nLeonard: Maybe, but you also think nine minutes isn\xe2\x80\x99t a while, so what do you know?\nScene: The dining car.\nHoward: You okay?\nAmy: Why? Because my boyfriend\xe2\x80\x99s off playing choo-choo with some weirdo?\nHoward: Well, to be fair, they\xe2\x80\x99re both weirdos.\nAmy: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what made me think tonight would be any different.\nBernadette: Well, just the fact that you got him up here still says a lot. To be honest, I bet Howie 200\nbucks it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t gonna happen.\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m going to the Lego store to get a big-ass R2-D2.\nBernadette: See? It\xe2\x80\x99s not just Sheldon. They\xe2\x80\x99re all idiots.\nHoward: She\xe2\x80\x99s right.\nBernadette: So, your boyfriend\xe2\x80\x99s a fixer-upper. Most of them are. I mean, look at this guy. You think he came like this? When I met him, he was a hot, goofy mess. Now, he\xe2\x80\x99s been to space. That\xe2\x80\x99s all me.\nHoward: I had a little to do with it.\nBernadette: Oh, sure you did. Who\xe2\x80\x99s Mama\xe2\x80\x99s big space man?\nHoward: I am.\nScene: The vets surgery.\nLeonard: They\xe2\x80\x99ve been in there, like, half an hour.\nPenny: Yeah, for future reference, that\xe2\x80\x99s a while.\nLeonard: How long should we stay?\nPenny: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I\xe2\x80\x99m kind of hungry.\nLeonard: I saw a Thai place next door.\nPenny: Oh. Okay. Oh. Oh. Hey.\nLeonard: How\xe2\x80\x99s she doing?\nPenny: How is everything?\nLeonard: Yeah.\nRaj: She\xe2\x80\x99s gonna be okay; they\xe2\x80\x99re gonna let me take her home.\nPenny: Oh, good.\nVet: So I want you to keep a close eye on her for the next 24 hours. Here are a few warning signs to look out for, and if you see any of them, don\xe2\x80\x99t hesitate to call.\nRaj: Oh. Thank you for taking such good care of my little girl.\nVet: My pleasure. Have a nice night.\nLeonard: Yes, thank you for all your help.\nPenny: Yeah. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry if you didn\xe2\x80\x99t think we were taking it seriously. We love animals.\nVet: Oh, do you guys own any pets?\nPenny: No.\nVet: Good.\nScene: The dining car.\nHoward: I love you so much.\nBernadette: I love you, too.\nHoward: Sorry.\nBernadette: Sorry.\nMan: You guys missed a pretty great time.\nSheldon: The conductor and I have the same pocket watch.\nMan: It was crazy.\nSheldon: Dare I say loco? Oh, and, Amy, guess what? The conductor said as soon as he gets off work, he can come back to the bed and breakfast and play his banjo for us.\nAmy: Okay. I need to speak to my boyfriend in private, like, right now.\nHoward: There\xe2\x80\x99s a car with a glass roof. Want to go look at the stars?\nBernadette: Oh, that sounds so romantic.\nAmy: Oh, give it a rest.\nBernadette: Let\xe2\x80\x99s go.\nAmy: Why are you still here?\nSheldon: Excuse me. I think you\xe2\x80\x99re being a little rude.\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99m being rude? You\xe2\x80\x99ve been rude to me this entire evening.\nSheldon: How is that possible? I\xe2\x80\x99ve hardly spoken to you since we got on the train.\nMan: I\xe2\x80\x99m detecting a little friction between you two, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be a third rail. Get it?\nSheldon: I get it.\nAmy: Leave.\nSheldon: What is your problem?\nAmy: It\xe2\x80\x99s Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s Day. We\xe2\x80\x99re supposed to be having a romantic weekend.\nSheldon: Oh, really? Because I remember you saying that this trip was going to be something we could both enjoy. Did you mean that, or were you just trying to trick me?\nAmy: Fine, it\xe2\x80\x99s true. I deserve romance, and I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know how else to make it happen.\nSheldon: Well, if you want romance, then let\xe2\x80\x99s have romance. Oh, look, there\xe2\x80\x99s wine. Mmm. Grape juice that burns. Uh, now let\xe2\x80\x99s gaze into each other\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, hmm? You blinked. I win.\nAmy: Sheldon.\nSheldon: Let\xe2\x80\x99s see. What\xe2\x80\x99s next? Oh, kissing\xe2\x80\x99s romantic.\nAmy: That was nice.\nSheldon: Good. Um, the conductor said if I come back to the engine room, he\xe2\x80\x99d show me how to bring the train through a crossing.\nAmy: Okay, have fun.\nSheldon: Do you want to come with me?\nAmy: Really? I do.\nMan: Hey, guys, wait up.\nScene: Raj\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nRaj: There you go. All cozy wozy. Here, let\xe2\x80\x99s see what the doctor says to keep an eye out for. Hmm. Rajesh, I was dreading Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s Day. Thank you for spending it with me. Yvette. Cinnamon, she-she gave me her phone number. If I\xe2\x80\x99d known it was that easy, I would have considered poisoning you months ago. Oh, what should I say? Oh, I know. I\xe2\x80\x99ll point out her name\xe2\x80\x99s Yvette, and that she\xe2\x80\x99s a vet. That\xe2\x80\x99s hysterical. She\xe2\x80\x99ll love it.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Hello.\nLeonard: Oh, hey. You\xe2\x80\x99re back. How was your trip?\nSheldon: It was wonderful.\nLeonard: Great. What did you do?\nSheldon: I made a new friend who likes trains as much as I do, uh, I kissed Amy on the lips, and, uh, the conductor played his banjo for me. Good night.\nLeonard: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna need more details.\nSheldon: Oh, well, my new friend\xe2\x80\x99s name was Eric. Um, Amy lips tasted like the brownie we had for dessert. Oh, and the banjo-playing conductor was missing a finger, but he made up for it with his can-do attitude.\nLeonard: No, hang on. Hang on. Are all those things equal to you?\nSheldon: Hmm. It never occurred to me to pick a favourite.\nLeonard: Well, give it a go.\nSheldon: I can\xe2\x80\x99t answer that without collecting additional data.\nLeonard: Additional data. You dog.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure how listening to other nine-fingered banjo players makes me dog, but all right.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
