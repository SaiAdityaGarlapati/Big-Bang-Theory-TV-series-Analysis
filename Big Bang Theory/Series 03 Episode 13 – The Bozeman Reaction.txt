b'Scene: A Chinese restaurant.\nHoward: Boy, seems like forever since the four of us have been out to eat, you know? Just the guys.\nRaj: Oh, God! Yes, we get it. You have a girlfriend now.\nHoward: A little jealous, are we?\nRaj: No, I\xe2\x80\x99m not jealous. All right, I\xe2\x80\x99d kill a hobo if it\xe2\x80\x99ll get me laid. Now, can we order?\nSheldon: Oh, dear Lord, they re-did the menu.\nLeonard: So what? It\xe2\x80\x99s the same food.\nSheldon: Oh, is it? Look at this. General Tso\xe2\x80\x99s Chicken is no longer listed under specialties. It\xe2\x80\x99s now under chicken.\nRaj: So?\nSheldon: Yes, General Tso.\nRaj: Not Tso the chicken, so the question. So?\nSheldon: So, why is it no longer a specialty? Did the chef lose confidence in the dish or himself? And look over here, shrimp in mobster sauce. What is mobster sauce?\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s obviously a typo.\nSheldon: Perhaps. Perhaps this restaurant\xe2\x80\x99s now a front for organized crime. For all we know, the mobster sauce contains actual chunks of deceased mobsters.\nRaj: No, no, no, no, I think it just means it\xe2\x80\x99s the kind of sauce that mobsters like.\nHoward: It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean any of that! It\xe2\x80\x99s a typo.\nLeonard: You know what? Let\xe2\x80\x99s just get a pizza.\nSheldon: Good idea. We\xe2\x80\x99ll go to Corleone\xe2\x80\x99s.\nHoward: Sure, no mobsters there.\nScene: The stairwell.\nSheldon: You know, the more I think about it, the mobster sauce couldn\xe2\x80\x99t possibly contain chunks of mobster.\nLeonard: And why is that?\nSheldon: It was listed under seafood.\nLeonard: What if they were mobsters who slept with the fishes?\nSheldon: Leonard, are we having a serious conversation or not?\nLeonard (noticing their door has been broken open): What the\xe2\x80\xa6?\nSheldon: The TV is gone.\nLeonard: So are our laptops.\nSheldon: Oh God, oh God, oh, God! It\xe2\x80\x99s all right. They didn\xe2\x80\x99t take my comic books.\nCredits sequence.\n  Scene: The apartment.\nSheldon: They took our TV, two laptops, four external hard-drives, our PS2, our PS3, our X-Box, our X-Box 360, our classic Nintendo, our Super Nintendo, our Nintendo 64 and our Wii.\nLeonard: We like games.\nSheldon: Right, games. They took Halo 1, Halo 2, Halo 3, Call of Duty 1, Call of Duty 2, Call of Duty 3, Rock Band, Rock Band 2, Final Fantasy 1 thru 9, The Legend of Zelda, The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess, Super Mario Brothers, Super Mario Galaxy, Mario and Sonic at the Winter Olympics and Ms. Pacman.\nPoliceman: Assorted video games.\nSheldon: When does the CSI team get here?\nPoliceman: What?\nSheldon: In anticipation of their arrival, I\xe2\x80\x99ve bagged some evidence. One of the thieves had the audacity to quench his thirst while ransacking our home. You should be able to pull some good prints off this. And now, here are my prints so you can rule me out as a suspect.\nLeonard: What about me?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, Leonard. It\xe2\x80\x99s too early to discount the possibility of this being an inside job.\nLeonard: Would I be completely out of line to ask you to shoot him?\nPoliceman: I\xe2\x80\x99d be happy to put him under a 72-hour psychiatric hold.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m not crazy. My mother had me tested.\nPoliceman: We\xe2\x80\x99re done here. Call this number, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll fax you a copy of the report so you can submit it to your insurance company.\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, that\xe2\x80\x99s the end of your inquiry?\nPoliceman: Do you have any more information that might be relevant?\nSheldon: Oh, my goodness. Where do I begin? For instance, my laptop contained four out of the five gedanken experiments necessary for a cogent restatement of the quantum measurement problem.\nLeonard: How is that going to help them?\nSheldon: Well, they could monitor scientific publications and see if anyone posts such a cogent restatement in the next couple of months. If so, the authors are most likely in possession of my stolen laptop.\nPoliceman: Good night, fellas. Come on, Bochco.\nLeonard: What are we supposed to do now?\nSheldon: The only thing we can do. Watch TV on our phones until the criminals return and bludgeon us to death in our sleep.\nLeonard: Does that mean you\xe2\x80\x99ve ruled me out as a suspect?\nSheldon: Oh, how I wish I could.\nScene: Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom. Sheldon is restless. He gets up and checks the door is locked. He then moves his chest of drawers in front of the door. Goes back to bed.\n  Sheldon: I do not have to urinate. I am the master of my own bladder. Drat.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nPenny: I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe it. If I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been working the dinner shift, I would\xe2\x80\x99ve run\nright into the robbers.\nLeonard: Hey, there\xe2\x80\x99s no reason for you to be scared.\nPenny: I\xe2\x80\x99m not scared. I would\xe2\x80\x99ve gone all Nebraska on their asses.\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard and Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard and Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard and Penny.\nLeonard: Hand me the bat.\nSheldon: We just had a major crime in the building, and you open the door without asking who it is?\nPenny: It won\xe2\x80\x99t happen again, what\xe2\x80\x99s up?\nSheldon: Nothing. Just wanted to see if you were both okay.\nLeonard: We\xe2\x80\x99re fine, Sheldon.\nSheldon: All right, then. Good night.\nPenny: Good night. That was weird, even for him.\nLeonard: Mm-hmm.\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard and Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard and Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard and Penny.\nPenny: Who is it?\nSheldon: Sheldon. Sheldon Cooper.\nPenny: Yes?\nSheldon: May I come in?\nPenny: Yeah.\nSheldon: I see you\xe2\x80\x99re drinking wine.\nLeonard: Yes, we are. And we\xe2\x80\x99re about to go to bed.\nSheldon: Uh-huh.\nPenny: Sheldon, do you want to sleep here tonight?\nSheldon: Oh, as small as Leonard is, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think the two of you\xe2\x80\x99d be comfortable on the couch.\nLeonard: What do you want?\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s not what I want, it\xe2\x80\x99s what evolution wants. Human beings are primates. Primates have evolved to live in groups, both for protection and support.\nLeonard: But you don\xe2\x80\x99t like other people.\nSheldon: I do tonight. It\xe2\x80\x99s scary over there.\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s getting scary here, too.\nScene: The apartment. Sheldon is drawing picture clues on his whiteboard.\nPenny: Um\xe2\x80\xa6 three little kittens? Three little pigs? God, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Star Wars?\nLeonard: Did we win? Can we go to bed?\nSheldon: Good Lord, I could not have made this easier. Hydrogen atom, H, plus pigs minus pea, Higgs. Bow, General Zod trapped in the Phantom Zone. Bow-zone. Pear. Tickle. Pear-tickle. Higgs Boson Particle. How could you not get that?\nLeonard: He\xe2\x80\x99s right, Penny. It\xe2\x80\x99s all there.\nPenny: Look, Sheldon, sweetie, I know you\xe2\x80\x99re feeling insecure, but we\xe2\x80\x99ve really got to go to sleep.\nSheldon: All right. I\xe2\x80\x99ll take the first watch and wake you at 0400.\nLeonard: Great. Good night.\nPenny: Wait, wait, what\xe2\x80\x99s 0400?\nLeonard: 4am.\nPenny: That\xe2\x80\x99s, like, in 45 minutes.\nLeonard: Just keep walking. (Sheldon checks door then puts TV on his phone)\nWoman on TV: It\xe2\x80\x99s quiet out there.\nMan on TV: Maybe a little too quiet.\nWoman on TV: Where are you going?\nMan on TV: Just gonna take a look around outside.\nSheldon: Bad idea.\nWoman on TV: No, Jim, don\xe2\x80\x99t open the door!\nSheldon: Listen to her, Jim.\nMan on TV: Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry, there\xe2\x80\x99s no one out here. (Sound of woman screaming. Sheldon nods, and turns off TV. Walks down to Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s room.)\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard and Penny! (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard and Penny! (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard and Penny!\nLeonard: Who is it?\nScene: Outside the apartment.\nHoward: All right, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a titanium dead bolt and a reinforced jamb controlled by a state-of-the-art electronic access system.\nSheldon: What if they cut the power?\nRaj: There\xe2\x80\x99s a 200-watt uninterruptible backup power supply.\nSheldon: What if someone steals my keys?\nRaj: There are independent voice and fingerprint scanners.\nSheldon: What if someone kidnaps me, forces me to record my voice, and then cuts off my thumb?\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99ll send them a basket of muffins.\nHoward: Now, inside, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got motion detectors, infrared sensors, and cameras connected to a server running state-of-the-art facial recognition software.\nLeonard: Where did you get all this stuff?\nHoward: I got a buddy over at the Department of Defence.\nLeonard: He just gave it to you?\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m sure he would have if I had asked. Ironically, their security isn\xe2\x80\x99t all that good.\nPenny (entering): Raj, your car is blocking me\xe2\x80\xa6 (A wire net falls on her, while a computer voice repeats the words \xe2\x80\x9cIntruder Alert\xe2\x80\x9d) What the hell?\nLeonard: Sorry, let me help you.\nSheldon: Wonderful security system if we\xe2\x80\x99re attacked by a school of tuna.\nHoward: Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry, the net\xe2\x80\x99s going to be electrified. Picture her on the floor, spasming uncontrollably.\nSheldon: Better.\nScene: Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom.\nSheldon: Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s journal. Security system in place. However, sleep continues to elude me. I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the underbelly of Pasadena, this so-called City of Roses, and it haunts me. Ah, the injustice, I lie here awake, tormented, while out there evil lurks, probably playing Donkey Kong on my classic Nintendo. (Hears a noise. Goes to check, then panics and climbs out window onto ledge.) Oh, dear. I am the master of my own bladder. (Crawls along to Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s window, where Leonard and Penny are inside being intimate. Knock, knock, knock) Leonard and Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard and Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard and Penny.\nPenny: Oh, my\xe2\x80\xa6\nLeonard: God, Sheldon. What the hell are you doing out there?\nSheldon: I heard a noise.\nLeonard: It was us. We knocked over a lamp.\nSheldon: Why would you knock over a lamp?\nLeonard: We were going to have\xe2\x80\xa6\nPenny: He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t need to know what we were doing, Leonard.\nSheldon: Oh! No, she\xe2\x80\x99s right, I don\xe2\x80\x99t need to know what you were doing. Carry on. (Starts to climb back out of window)\nLeonard: What are you doing? Use the door.\nSheldon: Good thinking. Perhaps I\xe2\x80\x99ll check the perimeter and make some warm milk.\nLeonard: Great, you do that.\nSheldon: Would you like me to bring you some warm milk?\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m lactose intolerant.\nSheldon: And you don\xe2\x80\x99t wish to alarm me with any more loud noises, very thoughtful. Warm milk, Penny?\nPenny: No, thanks.\nSheldon: Fine. Good night to you, sir. Miss.\nLeonard: Sorry about that.\nPenny: Ugh, what can you do? Here. (From outside there is the sound of the net falling and computer voice saying \xe2\x80\x9cIntruder alert.\xe2\x80\x9d Then Sheldon screaming. They run out to find Sheldon convulsing under the net.)\nLeonard: Looks like Wolowitz got the net electrified.\nPenny: Sheldon, are you okay?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m fine. Although I\xe2\x80\x99m no longer the master of my own bladder.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: My new computer came with Windows 7. Windows 7 is much more user-friendly than Windows Vista. I don\xe2\x80\x99t like that.\nLeonard: Don\xe2\x80\x99t you think looking for a new city to live in is a bit of an overreaction?\nSheldon: Our apartment was broken into, our security system tried to kill me, and as a result, I\xe2\x80\x99m leaving Pasadena forever. Tell me how that\xe2\x80\x99s overreacting.\nPenny: Come on, Sheldon, you can\xe2\x80\x99t move. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you need to stay in one place so the mother ship can find you when it returns?\nSheldon: Oh, if that were only true. Unfortunately, as I\xe2\x80\x99m earthbound for the foreseeable future, I need to find a location that\xe2\x80\x99s more hospitable than the mean streets of Pasadena. Like Enid, Oklahoma. Low crime rate and high-speed Internet connectivity, but no model train shops. Sorry, Enid.\nPenny: Is he quitting his job at the university?\nLeonard: Oh, no, he\xe2\x80\x99s going to telecommute. Everybody\xe2\x80\x99s really excited about it.\nSheldon: All right. Boone, North Carolina. Every summer since 1952, Boone has hosted an outdoor amphitheater portrayal of the life and times of its namesake, Dan\xe2\x80\x99l Boone. Sounds like something that would attract the wrong crowd. Penny, you\xe2\x80\x99re from Nebraska, correct?\nPenny: Born and raised. (Sheldon crosses Nebraska off his map)\nScene: Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom. Sheldon is packing.\nSheldon: It will take me a few days to get settled. After I do, I will e-mail you detailed PDFs containing diagrams and instructions that will guide you through packing and shipping the rest of my possessions to Bozeman, Montana. In the meantime, please forward my mail.\nLeonard: Any place specific or just the Bozeman, Montana Loony Bin?\nSheldon: I sense you\xe2\x80\x99re making a joke, but Bozeman does have a comedy club called The Loony Bin, so do not forward my mail there.\nHoward: Oh, come on. So you were the victim of a crime. That\xe2\x80\x99s part of life. When my great-grandfather first came to this country, he put all his hopes and dreams into this little butcher shop he ran on the Lower East Side of New York. You know what happened? Every customer who walked into that butcher shop and asked for a pound of liver, got ripped off. But, those people moved on, and so should you.\nSheldon: I am moving on. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to be a Bozite.\nLeonard: They call themselves Bozites?\nSheldon: They should. It\xe2\x80\x99s one of the first things I plan to bring up upon arrival.\nPenny: Sheldon, I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe I\xe2\x80\x99m saying this, but I\xe2\x80\x99m going to miss you.\nSheldon: Please, Penny, as you know, I\xe2\x80\x99m not comfortable with prolonged good-byes and maudlin displays of emotion, so I prepared a short video.\nSheldon on laptop screen: Greetings. As you know, I\xe2\x80\x99m not comfortable with prolonged good-byes and maudlin displays of emotion, so I prepared this short video. The four of you are three of my closest friends and one treasured acquaintance. Though I cannot state categorically that my life will be diminished by not having you in it, I am comfortable if you choose to believe that. Since you intend to remain in this lawless metropolitan area, statistics suggest that you will succumb to tragic and gruesome ends before we meet again. Live long and prosper.\nPenny: Sheldon, that\xe2\x80\x99s so\xe2\x80\xa6 (Turns to find he has gone.)\nSheldon (entering again): You might want to lock the door behind me. This isn\xe2\x80\x99t Bozeman.\nHoward (after Raj whispers to him): How the hell do I know who\xe2\x80\x99s the friend and who\xe2\x80\x99s the acquaintance?\nScene: Bozeman, Montana bus depot.\nSheldon: That is a bracing cold, an invigorating cold. Lord, is it cold!\nMan: Help you with your bags, sir?\nSheldon: Thank you, fellow Bozite. And may I say, you are the living embodiment of all the promises made by our lovely town\xe2\x80\x99s Chamber of Commerce. (Man picks up bags and starts running.) Wait! Wait! Excuse me! (At ticket desk) One ticket to Pasadena, California, please.\nScene: The apartment. Sheldon enters.\nHoward: Hey, look who\xe2\x80\x99s back!\nSheldon: Interesting. The acquaintance is the first to greet me.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
