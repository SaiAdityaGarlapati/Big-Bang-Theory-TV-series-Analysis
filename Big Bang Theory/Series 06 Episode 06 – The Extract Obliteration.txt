b'Scene: A dance video game where the characters are imperial stormtroopers from Star Wars and Bobba Fett. Opens onto the apartment where Howard and Raj are dancing to the game.\nRaj: Try to keep up, Howard, I\xe2\x80\x99m killing it.\nHoward: Yeah, I wish we looked as cool dancing in clubs as we do right now.\nLeonard: Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry, this is exactly how you look when you\xe2\x80\x99re dancing in clubs.\nRaj: You\xe2\x80\x99re welcome, ladies.\nSheldon: Paradigm-shifting news, gentlemen. (Switches game off)\nRaj: Dude! I was about to Bollywood this bitch.\nSheldon: Earlier today, I invited Professor Stephen Hawking to join me in the popular online game Words with Friends. Moments ago, he accepted my request. Do you understand what that means?\nHoward: That somewhere right now Stephen Hawking is saying, damn it, I meant to click no.\xe2\x80\x9d\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99ll walk you through it. The game is not called Words with Strangers. No, it\xe2\x80\x99s not even called Words with Acquaintances. It is called Words with\xe2\x80\xa6\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99m not finishing your sentence. You pulled the plug on my funk.\nSheldon: Friends! It\xe2\x80\x99s Words with Friends! Which Stephen Hawking and I officially are. Now all I need is a bunk bed with a slide, I\xe2\x80\x99ll have everything I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever wanted since I was six years old.\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99s really nice, Sheldon, I\xe2\x80\x99m happy for you.\nSheldon: And I\xe2\x80\x99m happy for you, too. You are now friends with someone who is officially friends with Stephen Hawking. Enjoy it, boys. You may have peaked.\nHoward: Sheldon, I know Stephen Hawking. I worked with him.\nSheldon: And if they ever come out with a game called Words with People You Once Worked With, you\xe2\x80\x99ll be off to the races.\nLeonard: Sheldon, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think this actually means\xe2\x80\xa6\nSheldon: Hold that thought! Professor Hawking has made a move. Boy, oh, boy. Oh, it\xe2\x80\x99s only a matter of time before we\xe2\x80\x99re coming up with fun nicknames for each other. I\xe2\x80\x99ll be Coop. He\xe2\x80\x99ll be Wheels. If he\xe2\x80\x99s okay with that. (Leaves)\nRaj (putting game back on and removing shirt): All right. Crank up the AC, boys, it\xe2\x80\x99s gonna get hot in here!\nCredits sequence.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nBernadette: So, I was taking a shower this morning, and when I got out, I started to dry off with what I thought was a towel but turned out to be Howard\xe2\x80\x99s mom\xe2\x80\x99s underwear. I had to take another shower. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t enough. Nothing will ever be enough.\nAmy: I once looked in Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s underwear drawer. He yelled at me. But now I know what it looks like and he can never take that away.\nBernadette: There\xe2\x80\x99s a book under here.\nPenny: Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99ll get that.\nBernadette: I got it.\nPenny: No, no, it\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\xa6\nBernadette: I got it. Why do you have a history textbook?\nPenny: No, it\xe2\x80\x99s not a big deal. Just taking a class at the Pasadena Community College.\nBernadette: That\xe2\x80\x99s great. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know you wanted to go back to school.\nPenny: It\xe2\x80\x99s just one history class. Look, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t finish college, so I thought I would give it a try.\nAmy: Not to mention, your acting career is going south like Sherman. Read about it in your book.\nBernadette: Why would you be embarrassed to tell us?\nPenny: No, I\xe2\x80\x99m not embarrassed. I just didn\xe2\x80\x99t want anyone to know because I haven\xe2\x80\x99t told Leonard yet.\nAmy: Why wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you tell Leonard?\nPenny: Because it\xe2\x80\x99s me going back to school, and he\xe2\x80\x99s gonna be all \xe2\x80\x9cyou can do it,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9chow can I help?\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m so proud of you.\xe2\x80\x9d Ugh!\nBernadette: I just can\xe2\x80\x99t believe you could keep something like that from him.\nAmy: You guys have got to be the weirdest couple I know.\nPenny: Really? You can\xe2\x80\x99t think of anyone weirder?\nAmy: I can, but she\xe2\x80\x99s sitting right there.\nScene: Amy\xe2\x80\x99s laboratory.\nSheldon: Yes. I play the word quiver with a triple letter and a double word score for 72 points. That ought to let the air out of your tyres, Hawking.\nAmy: Wow, my boyfriend is friends with Stephen Hawking and my new dandruff shampoo doesn\xe2\x80\x99t smell like tar. Everything really is coming up Amy.\nSheldon: It is glorious. One of the greatest intellects of our time has agreed to engage with me in a gentlemanly battle of wits. And I\xe2\x80\x99m spanking him so hard his grad students won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to sit down.\nAmy: You know, when one male dominates another, his testosterone level rises.\nSheldon: What\xe2\x80\x99s your point?\nAmy: It\xe2\x80\x99s exciting to think you might be getting a testosterone level.\nSheldon: Ooh, my friend Stephen just played the word act for 18 points. That\xe2\x80\x99s right, I call him Stephen now, because I checked, and he was not okay with Wheels.\nAmy: Oh, you could turn his act into extract (pronounced with emphasis on act), and it would be for double points.\nSheldon: Amy. Why would you give me a word? Now, if I play extract it would be cheating.\nAmy: Sorry.\nSheldon: Although, I could play the completely unrelated and better word extract (pronounced with emphasis on ex). Ethical conundrum avoided. Thanks, brain.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nPenny: Spaghetti okay?\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s crunchy. Just the way I like it.\nPenny: Yeah, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think the water was really boiling.\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s great. I love it.\nPenny: Okay, listen, there\xe2\x80\x99s something I need to tell you. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been thinking about going back to school for a while now. So a couple months ago, I started taking a history class at the community college.\nLeonard: Oh. That\xe2\x80\x99s great. Great, great, great. Why wait so long to tell me?\nPenny: I don\xe2\x80\x99t want you to make a big deal out of it.\nLeonard: Why do you think I\xe2\x80\x99d be like that? I get it, you\xe2\x80\x99re taking one class. It\xe2\x80\x99s nice. Maybe if it goes well, you take another, you enrol full-time. Ooh, be sure to keep an eye on which credits transfer to a four-year college.\nPenny: You\xe2\x80\x99re making it a big deal.\nLeonard: Sorry. Whatever. It\xe2\x80\x99s all good.\nPenny: Anyway, that\xe2\x80\x99s it. I just thought you should know.\nLeonard: Am I allowed to ask how the class is going?\nPenny: It\xe2\x80\x99s really good. We\xe2\x80\x99ve been talking about the origins of slavery. Turn in my first paper tomorrow.\nLeonard: Great topic. I can help with that. There are lots of different perspectives you can take, economic, sociological, political.\nPenny: Hey hey hey, this is my paper. And my perspective is that slavery is bad. Oh, and my professor\xe2\x80\x99s black, so I\xe2\x80\x99m pretty sure that\xe2\x80\x99s the right answer.\nLeonard: Can I take a look?\nPenny: No, Leonard, this is my thing.\nLeonard: Okay, I get it.\nPenny: Thank you.\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s like when I started doing chin-ups, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want you to see until I could do one. FYI, really close.\nPenny: Thank you. Now behave yourself and eat your dinner. Maybe later, if you\xe2\x80\x99re lucky, you get to sleep with a college girl.\nLeonard: Really? \xe2\x80\x98Cause I went to four years of college and five years of grad school, that never happened once.\nScene: The apartment.\nRaj: I think the next time I have to speak to a call centre in India, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to try using an American accent.\nHoward: Why?\nRaj: Because when I use my regular voice, I feel like I\xe2\x80\x99m making fun of them.\nHoward: That\xe2\x80\x99s ridiculous. Not to mention, your American accent is terrible.\nRaj: Dude, my accent is brilliant. (In American accent) Hey, my snow-white American friends, let\xe2\x80\x99s put some cow meat on the barbecue and eat it until we\xe2\x80\x99re all obese.\nHoward: This is what you sound like. I think I\xe2\x80\x99m talking in an American accent, but it really sounds like I\xe2\x80\x99m wearing a set of giant dentures.\nRaj: Sheldon, do I really sound like that?\nHoward: Tell him he sounds like that.\nRaj: Sheldon, you okay?\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s been three days. Why hasn\xe2\x80\x99t Stephen Hawking played a word?\nRaj: The guy\xe2\x80\x99s a genius. Maybe you weren\xe2\x80\x99t challenging enough for him.\nSheldon: Not challenging? I was humiliating the man. I was thinking of writing a book called A Brief History of the Time I Made Stephen Hawking Cry Like a Little Girl.\nHoward: There\xe2\x80\x99s the problem. You can\xe2\x80\x99t beat Hawking like that. He hates to lose. Everyone knows the guy\xe2\x80\x99s a big baby. I mean, forget the wheelchair, he should be in a stroller.\nSheldon: Really?\nHoward: One time when I was working with him, he said that Johnny Depp was in The Matrix. I told him he was wrong, but he kept insisting. So I looked it up online and showed him. Well, the next day, he had a pizza party, and everyone got invited but me. And then he was all, your invitation must have gotten lost in the matrix.\nSheldon: Good Lord, what have I done?\nRaj (in American accent): Good Lord, what have I done?\nHoward: Terrible.\nRaj: All right, hotshot, let\xe2\x80\x99s hear your Indian.\nHoward: I can\xe2\x80\x99t sit on that elephant, my ass is on fire from eating all this curry.\nRaj: Okay, yeah, that\xe2\x80\x99s pretty good.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom. Leonard sneaks from the bed and opens Penny\xe2\x80\x99s computer.\nLeonard: Please be good. Please be good. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Okay. She writes like she cooks.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Play. Play. Play. Play. Play.\nLeonard: What are you doing?\nSheldon: Trying to use a Jedi mind trick to control Stephen Hawking. Play. Play. Ugh! He must be wearing a tinfoil hat or something.\nLeonard: I did a bad thing.\nSheldon: Does it affect me?\nLeonard: No.\nSheldon: Then suffer in silence. Play. Play. Play. (Knock knock knock) Stephen Hawking. (Knock knock knock) Stephen Hawking. (Knock knock knock) Stephen Hawking.\nLeonard: Penny started taking a class. She wrote a paper, she didn\xe2\x80\x99t want me to read it, I went behind her back and I read it anyway.\nSheldon: Stephen Hawking hates me.\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to do. I mean, the paper\xe2\x80\x99s terrible. But if I tell her, she\xe2\x80\x99ll know that I read it and she\xe2\x80\x99ll get really mad.\nSheldon: I was beating him so bad, he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to be friends anymore. Why does everyone love me except Stephen Hawking?\nLeonard: Is it possible we\xe2\x80\x99re having two different conversations?\nSheldon: How would I know? I\xe2\x80\x99m not listening to you.\nLeonard: Hang on. Okay, here\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99re gonna do. Chess clock. We each get five minutes to talk about our problems. We\xe2\x80\x99ll take turns. Each turn will consist of a statement and a helpful response from the friend. Begin.\nSheldon: I humiliated Stephen Hawking in a game of Words with Friends. He stopped playing, and now we\xe2\x80\x99re not friends anymore.\nLeonard: He\xe2\x80\x99s probably busy. You\xe2\x80\x99re worried about nothing. Give it a couple more days. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure he\xe2\x80\x99ll play, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll see that everything\xe2\x80\x99s fine. My turn. I can\xe2\x80\x99t let Penny hand in a bad paper, but how do I tell her it\xe2\x80\x99s bad without letting her know that I read it?\nSheldon: Hmm. Beats me. Now, I know Hawking\xe2\x80\x99s not busy because I can see he\xe2\x80\x99s playing other people right now.\nLeonard: Maybe since you\xe2\x80\x99re so good, he\xe2\x80\x99s taking his time to meet the challenge. I want Penny to enjoy school\xe2\x80\xa6\nSheldon: Wolowitz told me he\xe2\x80\x99s a big baby. But I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know that, and I played extract for 82 points. It\xe2\x80\x99s all Amy\xe2\x80\x99s fault. She told me to play it. I have got to cut her loose.\nLeonard: Sheldon, I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t done talking. She hands in the paper tomorrow. I know I could help her. And she\xe2\x80\x99s my girlfriend. I, I should be allowed to help her. Why aren\xe2\x80\x99t I allowed to help her?\nSheldon: Yeah, I hear you, brother.\nLeonard: No. You need to give me some advice.\nSheldon: Fine. Women, huh?\nLeonard: No, specific to my situation.\nSheldon: Blonde women, huh?\nLeonard: Empathetic.\nSheldon: It sucks to be you.\nLeonard: I quit.\nSheldon: Leonard, wait. No. I listened to your dumb thing. Leonard, come back. Leonard, come back. Leonard, come back.\nLeonard: What?\nSheldon: Oh, of course, it only works on the weak-minded.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom.\nLeonard: Good morning, sunshine.\nPenny: Leonard. It\xe2\x80\x99s eight a.m. It\xe2\x80\x99s like the middle of the night.\nLeonard: I know, but I have to go to work, and I made you breakfast.\nPenny: Oh, wow, that\xe2\x80\x99s so sweet. Hey, what\xe2\x80\x99s this?\nLeonard: Uh, before you open that, um, are you familiar with the story of The Shoemaker and the Elves?\nPenny: Elves? Come on, Leonard. It\xe2\x80\x99s too early for Lord of the Rings.\nLeonard: No, no. Listen, um, once upon a time, there was this shoemaker and when he went to bed at night, elves would sneak in and they would make all these amazing shoes for him. And when the shoemaker woke up in the morning, he, he would be super happy, not mad at the elves at all. Open it.\nPenny: Okay. An examination of the economic, cultural, and political roots of slavery in the Old South, 1619 to 1865. What the hell is this?\nLeonard: Don\xe2\x80\x99t ask me. A little elf did it.\nPenny: So let me get this straight. You just assumed my paper would be bad so you wrote one for me?\nLeonard: No, I assumed it would be good. Then I read it.\nPenny: What?\nLeonard: No, I, I mean, it was good. There were just a few things that needed a little polishing.\nPenny: You changed every word.\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99s not true. Uh, slavery. 1619. Your name at the top. That\xe2\x80\x99s all you.\nPenny: You are such an ass. This is exactly why I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to tell you I was taking a class in the first place.\nLeonard: Please don\xe2\x80\x99t be upset. I just, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want you ending up with a bad grade and get discouraged and give up on the idea of going back to school.\nPenny: Right, because me being in school is so important to you. That way, you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have to be dating someone who\xe2\x80\x99s only a waitress.\nLeonard: Oh, come on, you know that\xe2\x80\x99s not true.\nPenny: Do I? Listen to me. I need to do this on my own. If I fail, I fail. If I pass, I pass. Do you get it?\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. I was just trying to help.\nPenny: Yeah, well, next time don\xe2\x80\x99t. Oh, and since you like stories so much, this is not The Shoemaker\nand the Elves, okay? This is, Give a man a fish, he eats it. Teach a man to fish, he, sells it or something. Whatever, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, it\xe2\x80\x99s just a lot better than what you did, you big jerk!\nScene: The cafeteria.\nHoward: You ever hear back from Hawking?\nSheldon: No. It would appear as if I\xe2\x80\x99ve lost him. Stupid brain.\nRaj: It\xe2\x80\x99ll be okay.\nSheldon: How can it be okay? Stephen Hawking\xe2\x80\x99s a genius and he talks like a robot. It\xe2\x80\x99s everything I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever wanted in a friend.\nRaj: Yeah, but if he\xe2\x80\x99s a sore loser, maybe you\xe2\x80\x99re better off without him.\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re right. I guess I just have to make lemonade out of the two of you. He played! He played! Coop and Rolling Thunder are together again. He was okay with that nickname.\nHoward: So, now all you have to do is let him win.\nSheldon: Yeah, way ahead of you. I will play the word at for two measly points, throwing the game and thus securing my friendship with the smartest man in the world.\nHoward: What are you waiting for? Hit send.\nSheldon: I can\xe2\x80\x99t. Losing on purpose is intellectually dishonest.\nRaj: So don\xe2\x80\x99t do it.\nSheldon: Oh, but I want to be Hawking\xe2\x80\x99s friend.\nHoward: So do it.\nSheldon: Oh, but if I do, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be a phony, a sellout, a Hollywood poser.\nRaj: Then don\xe2\x80\x99t do it.\nSheldon: I won\xe2\x80\x99t. This feels right. My mother always said, to thine own self be true.\nHoward: Good for you.\nSheldon: \xe2\x80\x98Course she also told me that every animal in the world got on one boat, so what does she know? And send.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: Oh, hey. Haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard from you in a couple days. You still mad at me?\nPenny: Nope. I have no reason to\xe2\x80\xa6 \xe2\x80\x9cB\xe2\x80\x9d mad at you. Minus.\nLeonard: Wow.\nPenny: That\xe2\x80\x99s right. On my paper. Not yours, mine, you punk-ass elf.\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to say.\nPenny: Hmm, how about, gee, Penny, you\xe2\x80\x99re smarter than I thought. You may be the one in school, but I\xe2\x80\x99m the one who learned a lesson. I\xe2\x80\x99m so stupid, Penny. Duh.\nSheldon: She sounds exactly like you.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nAmy: How\xe2\x80\x99d it go with Leonard?\nPenny: I don\xe2\x80\x99t think he\xe2\x80\x99ll be making that mistake again.\nBernadette: Good.\nPenny: So, I know this goes without saying, but if either of you tell Leonard you helped me rewrite this paper, I will beat you both with a bag of oranges.\nAmy: Understood.\nBernadette: Got it.\nPenny: Now, ladies, we got a B-minus on this paper. I think if we put our heads together, on the next one we could get an A.\nBernadette: Uh, but we got you a B-minus on purpose to make it believable.\nPenny: Believable? You saying I\xe2\x80\x99m not smart?\nBernadette: No, no!\nAmy: You\xe2\x80\x99re smart.\nPenny: That\xe2\x80\x99s better.\nAmy: I feel like I\xe2\x80\x99m in high school again.\nBernadette: Yeah, doing the prom queen\xe2\x80\x99s homework so she\xe2\x80\x99ll like us.\nAmy: I know. It\xe2\x80\x99s finally working.\nScene: The apartment. Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s phone rings.\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s Stephen Hawking.\nLeonard: Well answer it. I want to hear.\nSheldon: Professor Hawking, how nice of you to call.\nStephen Hawking: Hello. I really enjoyed our game, Dr. Cooper.\nSheldon: Oh, me, too.\nStephen Hawking: Or should I say Dr. Loser? Ha, ha, ha.\nSheldon: Yes, congratulations. You won fair and square. Uh, very impressive, sir.\nStephen Hawking: Do you like brain teasers?\nSheldon: Oh, I love brain teasers.\nStephen Hawking: What does Sheldon Cooper and a black hole have in common? They both suck. Neener neener.\nAdvertisements'
