b'Scene: The cafeteria.\nHoward: So, I got the craziest e-mail this morning.\nRaj: I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to burst your bubble, dude, but those penile enlargement pills do not work.\nHoward: Believe me, I know. The e-mail I got was from the office of Stephen Hawking.\nLeonard: You\xe2\x80\x99re kidding.\nRaj: Why?\nHoward: He\xe2\x80\x99s coming to the university for a couple weeks to lecture, and he\xe2\x80\x99s looking for an engineer to help maintain the equipment on his wheelchair.\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99s amazing. You\xe2\x80\x99ll be like his pit crew. A word of caution, I would not do your Stephen Hawking impression in front of him.\nHoward (in Stephen Hawking voice): You\xe2\x80\x99re right. I suppose that could be considered offensive.\nRaj: Oh, boy, Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s going to freak out.\nLeonard: Yeah, he worships Hawking.\nHoward: I was actually thinking about bringing him along when I go over there so he can meet the great man.\nRaj: That\xe2\x80\x99s really nice of you, Howard.\nHoward: Hm, it\xe2\x80\x99s no big deal.\nLeonard: Boy, a restraining order from Stephen Hawking. It\xe2\x80\x99ll look so nice next to the ones he\xe2\x80\x99s already got from Leonard Nimoy, Carl Sagan and Stan Lee.\nSheldon: Leonard, do you recall when I said that I was going to revolutionize humanity\xe2\x80\x99s understanding of the Higgs boson particle, and you said, Sheldon, it\xe2\x80\x99s two a.m., get out of my bedroom?\nLeonard: Like it was ten hours ago. What about it?\nSheldon: Well, I believe I\xe2\x80\x99ve done it. And I\xe2\x80\x99m only saying believe to sound modest, because, sweet Sam Houston, I did it.\nLeonard: Really?\nRaj: That\xe2\x80\x99s incredible. Oh, here, break out the math.\nSheldon: Oh, okay, let me see this. All right, so this particle here is the boson moving forward in time. Now, I was thinking\xe2\x80\xa6 Howard, you go ahead and eat. This isn\xe2\x80\x99t going to make any sense to you.\nHoward: Sheldon, I have a working understanding of physics.\nSheldon: Yeah, good for you, and don\xe2\x80\x99t stop working on it.\nRaj: Are you still going to tell him about you-know-who?\nHoward: Yep.\nLeonard: Still going to introduce him?\nHoward: Not on your life.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: A corridor.\nSheldon: Please, please, please let me meet Hawking.\nHoward: I told you, no.\nSheldon: But I said I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.\nHoward: No, you said, would it help if I said I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry?\nSheldon: And you never answered me. So who owes whom an apology now?\nHoward: Sheldon, you\xe2\x80\x99re a condescending jerk. Why on earth would I want to do something nice for you?\nSheldon: Um, to go to Jewish heaven?\nHoward: Jews don\xe2\x80\x99t have heaven.\nSheldon: Then to avoid Jewish hell?\nHoward: Have you met my mother? I live in Jewish hell.\nSheldon: Howard, please. This is Stephen Hawking. Perhaps my only intellectual equal.\nHoward: Oh, you can\xe2\x80\x99t be serious.\nSheldon: Try to put yourself in my place. Imagine you\xe2\x80\x99re the sole human being living on a planet populated with nothing but dogs. And then it turns out there\xe2\x80\x99s another human being.\nHoward: Hang on. Are you saying the rest of us are dogs?\nSheldon: Yeah, okay, I can see you\xe2\x80\x99re going to take this the wrong way. Let me try again. Imagine you\xe2\x80\x99re the sole human being living on a planet populated with nothing but chimps.\nHoward: Get out of my lab.\nSheldon: Oh, now they\xe2\x80\x99re so much smarter than dogs. Have you seen them on those little bicycles?\nHoward: Get out.\nSheldon: How about dolphins?\nHoward: Out!\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: So, come on, how was the first day with Hawking?\nHoward: It was great. We talked about movies.\nSheldon: Oh!\nHoward: I showed him some card tricks.\nSheldon: Oh!\nHoward: He even let me read a couple pages from his new book.\nSheldon: Oh!\nHoward: Something got you down there, bunky?\nSheldon: Howard, please, I\xe2\x80\x99m begging you.\nLeonard: Raj, you\xe2\x80\x99re our group historian. Has Sheldon ever begged before?\nRaj: Three times. He begged the Fox network not to cancel Firefly. He begged the TNT network to cancel Babylon 5. And when he got food poisoning at the Rose Bowl Parade, he begged a deity he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t believe in to end his life quickly.\nSheldon: Do you understand how important Hawking is to me? When I was six years old, I dressed up as him for Halloween.\nHoward: You\xe2\x80\x99re kidding.\nSheldon: No, sir, no, I took my dad\xe2\x80\x99s desk chair, attached a Speak & Spell to it and made my sister push me up and down the block to trick or treat. Granted most people thought I was R2-D2, but still, I got a lot of candy.\nHoward: You don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to be understanding the English word no. Maybe a different language will help. Russian, nyet. Chinese, bu. Japanese, iie. Klingon, qo. Binary coded Ascii, 0110111001101111.\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s actually 01100111.\nHoward: No!\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99m not asking for me, I\xe2\x80\x99m asking for Hawking.\nHoward: Let me try gansta, hells no.\nSheldon: Okay, look, how about this? Just give him my paper on the Higgs boson. If he sees the incredible breakthrough I\xe2\x80\x99ve made, he\xe2\x80\x99ll reach out to me.\nLeonard: What if he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t?\nSheldon: He will, he\xe2\x80\x99s really smart.\nHoward: That\xe2\x80\x99s an interesting idea. Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you give me a minute to talk it over with my friends?\nSheldon: How do I do that?\nHoward: You walk away.\nSheldon: Walking away.\nLeonard: You do realize you own his ass right now.\nHoward: I do.\nRaj: You can make him do anything you want.\nHoward: Yeah, I know, I\xe2\x80\x99m just trying to figure out how much I want to punish him.\nRaj: Well, don\xe2\x80\x99t be too mean.\nSheldon: Hey, fellas, I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking about making some freshly brewed iced tea if anyone would like some.\nRaj: I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t mind a glass.\nSheldon: I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t talking to you.\nRaj: Bring him to his bony knees.\nHoward: Sheldon, come on back.\nSheldon: Yes, yes. What did you decide?\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99ll give your paper to Professor Hawking.\nSheldon: Great, thank you. Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s terrific.\nHoward: But in exchange, I\xe2\x80\x99d like you to do a few things for me.\nSheldon: What kinds of things?\nHoward: Are you familiar with the 12 labours of Hercules?\nSheldon: Of course.\nHoward: You should be so lucky.\nScene: Howard\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom.\nSheldon: All right. What would you like me to do first?\nHoward: Well, I thought I\xe2\x80\x99d start you off by polishing my belt buckles.\nSheldon: Oh. By all means. When I was a boy, I would polish my Mee-Maw\xe2\x80\x99s silver. And she would entertain me with stories about growing up in Oklahoma. Interesting woman. You know, she once killed a prairie dog with a gravy boat.\nHoward: That\xe2\x80\x99s nice.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of belt buckles.\nHoward: Funny thing is, I only have one belt. Anyway, I\xe2\x80\x99ll let you get started. Oh, by the way, the little marks, uh, that look like water spots, I tend to stand too close to the urinal, so what you\xe2\x80\x99re seeing there is splash back.\nSheldon: You make sissy on your belt buckles? Mee-Maw\xe2\x80\x99s forks never had that.\nHoward: Here is a black light to check them. And for your own peace of mind, you might not want to shine that around the rest of the room.\n(Later)\nHoward: Sheldon, these look great. They\xe2\x80\x99re like magnificent little crowns to hang over my magnificent little jewels. How\xe2\x80\x99d you get them so shiny?\nSheldon: Oh, I-I buffed them with Turtle Wax. The man down at Pep Boys says from now on, the urine should just bead up and roll right off.\nHoward: Way to go the extra mile. Your Mee-Maw would be proud.\nSheldon: My Mee-Maw must never know of this. Now will you give Professor Hawking my paper?\nHoward: Oh, my dear boy, no. Okay. Next, this is a sexy French maid costume I bought for Bernadette. I thought it might spice things up and get her to dust my room at the same time, but I was wrong and really wrong.\nSheldon: And you want me to return it for you?\nHoward: No, no, no, mon petit cherie.\nScene: The cafeteria. Sheldon enters in the French maid costume.\nSheldon: What are you all staring at? Didn\xe2\x80\x99t you ever see a man try to get a meeting with Stephen Hawking before?\nScene: The laundry room.\nPenny: Hey.\nSheldon: Hello.\nPenny: It\xe2\x80\x99s not Saturday night. Why are you doing your laundry?\nSheldon: This is not my laundry.\nPenny: Wow, are these Amy\xe2\x80\x99s? Kind of trashy, good for her.\nSheldon: Those are Howard\xe2\x80\x99s.\nPenny: Ugh. Why are you washing Howard\xe2\x80\x99s man panties?\nSheldon: Because if I don\xe2\x80\x99t, he won\xe2\x80\x99t give my paper to Stephen Hawking. He\xe2\x80\x99s a famous physicist.\nPenny: Yeah, yeah, I know, he\xe2\x80\x99s the wheelchair dude who invented time.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s close enough.\nPenny: I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand, why doesn\xe2\x80\x99t Howard just introduce you to the guy?\nSheldon: Because he\xe2\x80\x99s punishing me for being a, quote, condescending jerk. You don\xe2\x80\x99t think I\xe2\x80\x99m condescending, do you?\nPenny: Well\xe2\x80\xa6\nSheldon: Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, condescending means\xe2\x80\xa6\nPenny: I know what it means. And yes, you love correcting people and putting them down.\nSheldon: Au contraire. When I correct people I am raising them up. You should know, I do it for you more than anyone.\nPenny: Come on, you do it to feel superior. I see that twinkle in your eye when someone says who instead of whom or thinks the moon is a planet.\nSheldon: Or Don Quixote is a book about a donkey named Hotay.\nPenny: See, there it is, there\xe2\x80\x99s that twinkle.\nSheldon: Well, I can\xe2\x80\x99t help it. That\xe2\x80\x99s an involuntary twinkle.\nPenny: What do you want me to tell you, Sheldon?\nSheldon: I want you to tell me that Howard is being mean to me for no reason.\nPenny: Fine, Howard is being mean to you for no reason.\nSheldon: I knew it.\nScene: Howard\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom.\nHoward: What\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\nBernadette: Every time I spend the night, your mom slaps me on the behind and says, go get \xe2\x80\x98im.\nHoward: It\xe2\x80\x99s not her fault. She\xe2\x80\x99s getting hormone replacement therapy. Makes her crazy horny. Check this out, I got Sheldon to wear the French maid\xe2\x80\x99s costume.\nBernadette: Oh, my God, that\xe2\x80\x99s terrible.\nHoward: Hey, I gave you first crack at it.\nBernadette: Why are you doing that? You\xe2\x80\x99re being mean to him.\nHoward: He\xe2\x80\x99s mean to me all the time. You\xe2\x80\x99ve heard him tease me about not having a doctorate.\nBernadette: If you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get teased about that, get a doctorate. I have one, they\xe2\x80\x99re great.\nHoward: Oh, come on, the man torments me. I\xe2\x80\x99m just letting him have a little taste of his own medicine.\nBernadette: It\xe2\x80\x99s not the same thing. Sheldon doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know when he\xe2\x80\x99s being mean because the part of his brain that should know is getting a wedgie from the rest of his brain.\nHoward: Fine, I\xe2\x80\x99ll just make him do a couple more things, then I\xe2\x80\x99ll stop.\nBernadette: No, you have to stop now.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Bernadette, I want to remind you, you promised to take me dress shopping tomorrow!\nBernadette: Oh, damn. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, I can\xe2\x80\x99t make it, but Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s going to go with you! And that\xe2\x80\x99s the last thing you do to him.\nScene: A shop changing rooms.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Sheldon! I need your help!\nSheldon: What is it now, Mrs. Wolowitz?\nMrs Wolowitz (off): It\xe2\x80\x99s this dress. When I put my front in, my back pops out. When I put my back in, my front pops out. It\xe2\x80\x99s like trying to keep two dogs in a bathtub!\nSheldon: What do you want me to do?\nMrs Wolowitz (off): We\xe2\x80\x99re gonna have to work as a team. Get in here, grab a handful, and start stuffing.\nSheldon (off): I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure how to do this.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): It\xe2\x80\x99s easy, just pretend you\xe2\x80\x99re putting away a sleeping bag.\nSheldon (off): Sleeping bags don\xe2\x80\x99t usually sweat this much, but okay.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Now zip me up.\nSheldon (off): Oh, if we squeeze you any tighter, you may turn into a diamond.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): You\xe2\x80\x99re right, who am I kidding? You should have seen me when I was young, Sheldon. The fellas used to line up and bring me boxes of candy. Why did I eat it all? Would you hold me?\nSheldon: Oh, no, you know, I\xe2\x80\x99m not really the holding kind of\xe2\x80\xa6 Oh!\nScene: The apartment.\nHoward: Oh, guys, I just remembered. I got you some Hawking souvenirs.\nLeonard: What are these?\nHoward: Gears and springs from his wheelchair. Pretty cool, huh?\nRaj: Wow, that\xe2\x80\x99s amazing.\nHoward: Yeah, I made an adjustment on the motor drive and when I was putting it back together I could not for the life of me figure out where they went.\nSheldon: I did it. Had to go to three clothing stores, but we finally found a dress that could envelop your mother.\nHoward: I should have sent you to the custom car cover place in Altadena. They have her pattern on file.\nSheldon: Humorous. Now will you please present my paper to Professor Hawking?\nHoward: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\nSheldon: Oh, for heaven\xe2\x80\x99s sake. I did your laundry, I pee-pee-proofed your belt buckles, I, I even sprained my wrist helping your mother lift her bosom.\nHoward: All right, Sheldon, there\xe2\x80\x99s only one thing left I want you to do. Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry, it\xe2\x80\x99s an easy one.\nSheldon: Okay.\nHoward: Give me a compliment.\nSheldon: Fine. You have very tiny hands.\nHoward: No, about my job. I want you to tell me I\xe2\x80\x99m good at what I do.\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re obviously good at what you do.\nHoward: Well, then why are you always ripping on me?\nSheldon: Oh, I understand the confusion. I have never said that you are not good at what you do. It\xe2\x80\x99s just that what you do is not worth doing.\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s nicer than anything he\xe2\x80\x99s ever said to me. I\xe2\x80\x99d take it and run.\nHoward: Thank you, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Now will you give my paper to Hawking?\nHoward: Sorry, I can\xe2\x80\x99t.\nSheldon: What, why not?\nHoward: I gave it to him three days ago. He was really impressed. He wants to meet you.\nSheldon: All right, then. Thank you, Howard. Please let Professor Hawking know that I\xe2\x80\x99m available at his earliest convenience.\nRaj: I thought he might be a little more excited.\nLeonard: Give it a second. (Sound of Sheldon shrieking in joy in his bedroom)\nScene: Stephen Hawking\xe2\x80\x99s office.\nSheldon: Professor Hawking, it\xe2\x80\x99s an honour and a privilege to meet you, sir.\nHawking: I know.\nSheldon: I want to thank you for taking time to see me.\nHawking: My pleasure. I enjoyed reading your paper very much. You clearly have a brilliant mind.\nSheldon: I know.\nHawking: Your thesis that the Higgs boson is a black hole accelerating backwards through time is fascinating.\nSheldon: Thank you. It just, it came to me one morning in the shower.\nHawking: That\xe2\x80\x99s nice. Too bad it\xe2\x80\x99s wrong.\nSheldon: What do you mean wrong?\nHawking: You made an arithmetic mistake on page two. It was quite the boner.\nSheldon: No, no, th-th-th-that can\xe2\x80\x99t be right. I-I don\xe2\x80\x99t make arithmetic mistakes.\nHawking: Are you saying I do?\nSheldon: Oh, no, no, no, of course not. It\xe2\x80\x99s just, I was thinking\xe2\x80\xa6 Oh, gosh, golly, I made a boo-boo, and I gave it to Stephen Hawking.\nHawking: Great, another fainter.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
