b'Scene: The Cheesecake Factory\nPenny: Hey, you guys ready to order?\nHoward: Uh..\nLeonard: Sure\nPenny: Okay, Priya?\nPriya: Uh, I\xe2\x80\x99ll have the Shepherd\xe2\x80\x99s Pie. You want to split that with me?\nLeonard: Oh, no, no, no, he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t.\nPriya: Why not?\nLeonard: Well, you have milk in the taters, milk in the gravy, parmesan crust. Your lactose-intolerant boyfriend will turn into a gas-filled Macy\xe2\x80\x99s Day balloon.\nSheldon: Not quite accurate. The Macy\xe2\x80\x99s balloons are filled with helium, whereas Leonard produces copious amounts of methane.\nLeonard: So, no, on the Shepherd\xe2\x80\x99s Pie. Can we move on?\nPenny: Yeah, a little tip: he says he can eat frozen yoghurt. Do not believe it.\nLeonard: Sea bass. I\xe2\x80\x99ll have the sea bass.\nHoward: You gotta like this, the girlfriend and the ex-girlfriend bonding over your rooty-tooty stinky booty.\nLeonard: Kill me.\nSheldon: It wouldn\xe2\x80\x99help. The human body is capable of being flatulent for hours after death.\nBernadette: Guys, sorry I\xe2\x80\x99m late. I have amazing news.\nSheldon: Bernadette, before you change the subject, does anyone have any final comments on Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s faulty digestive system?\nLeonard: So, what\xe2\x80\x99s your news, Bernadette?\nBernadette: The thesis committee accepted my doctoral dissertation. I\xe2\x80\x99m getting my PhD.\nPenny: Oh!\nSheldon: Oh, congratulations.\nPenny: Wow, so that means you\xe2\x80\x99re a doctor, you\xe2\x80\x99re a doctor, you\xe2\x80\x99re a doctor, you\xe2\x80\x99re a doctor, and Howard, you know a lot of doctors.\nHoward: Congratulations, honey.\nBernadette: Thank you.\nLeonard: So, Howard, tell us, how\xe2\x80\x99s it feel knowing that when you two get married, you\xe2\x80\x99ll be referred to as Mr. and Dr. Wolowitz?\nSheldon: Unless he takes Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s last name. And considering her advanced status, that could open some doors for him.\nHoward: Please, this isn\xe2\x80\x99t about me. I\xe2\x80\x99m proud of you.\nBernadette: Well, you\xe2\x80\x99ll be really be proud of this. I was headhunted by a big pharmaceutical company. They\xe2\x80\x99re gonna pay me a buttload of money!\nHoward: What?\nLeonard: Bernadette, that\xe2\x80\x99s great. Howard, do you make a buttload?\nHoward: Better than what you\xe2\x80\x99ve got a buttload of.\nLeonard: Hey, if I roll down the windows in the car, everything\xe2\x80\x99s peachy. If you do it, you\xe2\x80\x99re still not a doctor.\nPenny: Yeah, just a heads-up on the car window deal. It helps, but everything is not peachy.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: Raj\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nRaj (earphones in, singing): Oh, if there was a problem, you can\xe2\x80\x99t solve it, check out the hook while my DJ revolves it. Ice, Ice, baby. Ice, Ice, baby. (Removes headphones and goes to refrigerator).\nPriya (off): Oh, God, I feel ridiculous in this dress.\nLeonard (off): You look beautiful, Lieutenant Uhura. Now prepare for inspection.\nPriya (off): Shh, my brother\xe2\x80\x99s going to hear you.\nLeonard (off): Relax, he\xe2\x80\x99s got headphones on. And we\xe2\x80\x99re ten miles above Earth in a starship.\nRaj: Really, ten miles? You\xe2\x80\x99re orbiting inside the atmosphere? Moron.\nPriya (off): I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe I\xe2\x80\x99m wearing my brother\xe2\x80\x99s Halloween costume.\nLeonard (off): I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe you think he only wears it on Halloween. Open the landing bay doors, shuttle craft approaching.\nRaj: Okay, gotta go.\nScene: Howard\xe2\x80\x99s house.\nHoward: Hey, what\xe2\x80\x99s up?\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Is that my future daughter-in-law, the doctor?\nHoward: No, Ma! It\xe2\x80\x99s Raj!\nMrs Wolowitz (off): He\xe2\x80\x99s a doctor too, right?\nHoward: Yes!\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Like Leonard and the skinny weirdo!\nHoward: Sheldon, yes! Everybody\xe2\x80\x99s a doctor but me!\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Well, whose fault is that?\nHoward: What\xe2\x80\x99s up?\nRaj: Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s putting disgusting memories in my memory foam mattress. Can I stay here tonight?\nHoward: Sure, but I\xe2\x80\x99m going out with Bernadette. It\xe2\x80\x99ll just be you and my mother.\nRaj: I guess that\xe2\x80\x99s okay.\nHoward: Ma, can Rajesh sleep over?!\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Of course, he and I can play doctor!\nRaj: She\xe2\x80\x99s kidding, right?\nHoward: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, she\xe2\x80\x99s pretty feisty since they put her on hormone-replacement therapy.\nMrs Wolowitz (off): Paging Dr. Cutie Pie!\nScene: The apartment. Sheldon is talking to Amy on webcam.\nSheldon: I must say, Amy, I was very impressed to see that Bernadette got her PhD.\nAmy: It\xe2\x80\x99s indeed admirable. Although, it is microbiology.\nSheldon: Your doctorate is in neurobiology. I fail to see the distinction.\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99ll make it simple for you. I study the brain, the organ responsible for Beethoven\xe2\x80\x99s Fifth Symphony. Bernadette studies yeast, the organism responsible for Michelob Lite. Is there something wrong with your neck?\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s a little stiff. What a remarkably fragile structure to support such a valuable payload. Not unlike balancing a Faberge egg on a Pixie Stick.\nAmy: Have you considered massage?\nSheldon: I\xe2\x80\x99d like to respond to that sarcastically. Yes, I relish the thought of a stranger covering my body with oil and rubbing it.\nAmy: I was proposing you massage your muscles with your own hands.\nSheldon: Still sounds like a lot of unnecessary touching.\nAmy: Trust me. With your right hand, locate the spot where the scapula meets the acromion process.\nSheldon: All right.\nAmy: Now push your third finger along the ridge of the shoulder blade, making a small rotation as you do so.\nSheldon: Rotating.\nAmy: You should feel a small node-like object rolling back and forth along the bone.\nSheldon: You mean the myofascial point?\nAmy: Obviously. Now bear down on it like the seventh grade noogies we all know too well.\nSheldon: Oh, dear Lord, yes, yes, oh, yes! Amy, I\xe2\x80\x99ve never been touched like this before! Oh! Oh, my hands are magic!\nAmy: Don\xe2\x80\x99t flatter yourself. Your hands are blunt tools guided by my knowledge of the nervous system. I could just as easily have paralyzed you.\nSheldon: There\xe2\x80\x99s someone at my door.\nAmy: That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t interest me. Goodbye.\nRaj (at door): Can I sleep here tonight?\nSheldon: Why?\nRaj: Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s having astronomically inaccurate Star Trek sex with my sister.\nSheldon: I can see how that would be upsetting. Come in. I\xe2\x80\x99ll get the sheets and blankets for the couch.\nRaj: Oh, don\xe2\x80\x99t bother. I\xe2\x80\x99ll just sleep in Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s room.\nSheldon: No, I can\xe2\x80\x99t authorize that.\nRaj: Well, he\xe2\x80\x99s in my bed. Why can\xe2\x80\x99t I be in his?\nSheldon: The Hammurabic Code is an eye for an eye, not a bed for a bed.\nRaj: Come on, dude, I\xe2\x80\x99m exhausted, and Tyra Banks says the most important item in your makeup bag is a good night\xe2\x80\x99s sleep.\nSheldon: All right. This is a form indemnifying me from your use of Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom. Sign here, indicating that I tried to stop you and did so using a stern facial expression.\nRaj: Good night, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Wait. Not yet. We still have to go over safety procedures. Now, the apartment has three emergency exits located here, here, and here. In the event of a power outage, luminous paint will guide you to the nearest exit.\nRaj: You\xe2\x80\x99re kidding.\nSheldon: I never kid about safety.\nScene: Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom. Leonard enters, and accidentally sits on Raj. Both exclaim.\nLeonard: What are you doing here?\nRaj: I was sleeping.\nLeonard: In my bed?\nRaj: Well, I would\xe2\x80\x99ve slept in my own bed, but it was being used to bring shame to my family. And the memory of Gene Roddenberry.\nLeonard: Oh, you heard?\nRaj: Scotty, I need more power.\nLeonard: Sorry. Does Sheldon know you\xe2\x80\x99re sleeping in here?\nRaj: Are you kidding? He made me sign a waiver, participate in an emergency fire drill and take a refresher course in CPR. Thank God he had a dummy.\nLeonard: Oh, yeah. Mouth-to-Mouth Mona. You know, she used to date Howard?\nRaj: Oh, my God, she\xe2\x80\x99s that Mona? Why can\xe2\x80\x99t you and my sister spend your nights here?\nLeonard: We tried. She doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get along with Sheldon.\nRaj: Sheldon doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get along with Sheldon. It\xe2\x80\x99s still no reason for me to have to listen to you arm your photon torpedoes every night.\nLeonard: Okay, well, how about this. Until Priya gets her own place, you stay here and I\xe2\x80\x99ll stay at your apartment.\nRaj: Can I bring girls here?\nLeonard: You? Sure. Bring as many as you want.\nRaj: Okay, deal.\nLeonard: Just not against their will.\nScene: The cafeteria.\nLeonard: Do you really think you should be eating that cake?\nHoward: Why?\nLeonard: If you\xe2\x80\x99re gonna be a trophy husband for a rich wife, you might want to watch your waistline.\nRaj: He\xe2\x80\x99s right. A minute on the lips, a lifetime on the hips.\nHoward: Yeah, ha-ha. First of all, I\xe2\x80\x99m not threatened by my fianc\xc3\xa9e\xe2\x80\x99s success. I\xe2\x80\x99m proud of her. And secondly, I have my own career.\nLeonard: Until you have kids.\nSheldon: Good news, Raj. I got the blood work back from the lab. You\xe2\x80\x99re okay to stay for a while.\nRaj: When did you take my blood?\nSheldon: Not important. Your sugar was a little high. I\xe2\x80\x99d follow up with your regular physician. In the meantime, I have some paperwork here for you to go over.\nRaj: What the hell is this?\nSheldon: Boilerplate stuff. A modified roommate agreement for a temporary house guest. And a living will and durable power of attorney.\nRaj: This says you can make end of life decisions for me.\nSheldon: As your friend, let\xe2\x80\x99s hope it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t come to that. Please sign.\nRaj: Did you sign this?\nLeonard: There\xe2\x80\x99s a reciprocity clause. You get to pull the plug on him, too.\nRaj: Well, that seems fair.\nSheldon: Congratulations and welcome temporarily aboard. Here\xe2\x80\x99s your I.D. Card, your key and your lapel pin. Which Leonard was too cool to wear. FYI, part of your responsibilities as roommate pro tem will be to drive me to and from work, the comic book store, the barbershop and the park for one hour every other Sunday for fresh air.\nLeonard: Bring a ball or a Frisbee, you know, something he can chase.\nSheldon: Also, you\xe2\x80\x99re tasked with bringing home all takeout dinners. Tonight is Thai food. You\xe2\x80\x99ll find the standard order in appendix B or downloadable from my FTP server. If you have any questions, here\xe2\x80\x99s the FAQ sheet, or if you prefer the human touch, I do a live web chat called Apartment Talk on Tuesday nights.\nLeonard: No backsies.\nScene: The apartment.\nRaj: Sheldon, dinner!\nSheldon: What is this?\nRaj: This is the difference between eating and dining.\nSheldon: Remarkable. I\xe2\x80\x99m just realizing how much Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s been skating by all these years.\nRaj: It\xe2\x80\x99s not a big thing. Just think of me as a brown Martha Stewart.\nPenny (at door): Hey, Sheldon, did you change your Wi-Fi password again?\nSheldon: Yes, it\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cPenny, get your own Wi-Fi.\xe2\x80\x9d No spaces.\nPenny: Thanks. Wow! What\xe2\x80\x99s with the fancy spread?\nSheldon: My new roommate is bending over backwards to ingratiate himself to me. (Pointing to lapel badge) Uh, nice touch, by the way.\nPenny: What do you mean, new roommate? What happened to Leonard?\nSheldon: The same thing that happened to Homo Erectus. He was replaced by a superior species.\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99m the new Homo in town. That came out wrong.\nPenny: All right, let me try this again. Where\xe2\x80\x99s Leonard?\nRaj: He\xe2\x80\x99s living at my place, so I\xe2\x80\x99m living here.\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re living here provisionally. But I must say it\xe2\x80\x99s looking good.\nPenny: Woah, Leonard and Priya are living together? That\xe2\x80\x99s big.\nSheldon: No. Origami napkin swans, that\xe2\x80\x99s the headline.\nRaj: It\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing.\nScene: Bernadette\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom.\nHoward: So do you know what kind of research you\xe2\x80\x99ll be doing at this pharmaceutical company?\nBernadette: Well, there are a couple of opportunities available, but I volunteered for the premature ejaculation project. I mean, it\xe2\x80\x99s not like either one of us has heart disease. Oh, I almost forgot. I got you a little present.\nHoward: Oh, Bernie, no. You didn\xe2\x80\x99t have to.\nBernadette: I wanted to. Come on, open it.\nHoward: You bought me a Rolex? How much did this cost?\nBernadette: Oh, you let me worry about the money. I just want my baby to have pretty things.\nScene: The apartment.\nRaj: More wine?\nPenny: Oh, no, no, no. I\xe2\x80\x99ve had way too much already.\nSheldon: Here\xe2\x80\x99s an interesting fact about alcohol.\nPenny: Hit me.\nSheldon: Man is not the only species that ferments fruit in order to become intoxicated. Can you guess what the other is? Hint, sometimes they pack the alcohol in their trunks.\nPenny: Monkeys.\nSheldon: When does a monkey have a trunk?\nPenny: When a suitcase just won\xe2\x80\x99t do.\nSheldon: Mmm, all right. It would appear as if alcohol is playing keep-away with your intelligence. Good night. Please note, it is now past ten p.m. Per our roommate agreement, kindly refrain from raucous laughter, clinking of glasses, and celebratory gunfire.\nPenny: Okay, explain something to me. You watch Leonard put up with that guy for years and years. What has to break inside your brain for you to think, Oh, Krishna, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to get me some of that?\nRaj: Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s a lot better than having to wear noise-cancelling headphones in my own apartment.\nPenny: What? Oh, God, yeah. Yeah. Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s a noisy little dude in the sack.\nRaj: Every night.\nPenny: Really? Even during allergy season, when he has to alternate between kissing and breathing?\nRaj: It\xe2\x80\x99s my sister. Can we not talk about this any more?\nPenny: Yeah. Sorry, sorry. Can I tell you a secret?\nRaj: Yeah.\nPenny: I screwed up. Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s a great guy. Never should have broken up with him.\nRaj: Well, uh, to paraphrase Shakespeare, It\xe2\x80\x99s better to have loved and lost than to stay home every night and download increasingly shameful pornography.\nPenny: Oh, you poor baby.\nRaj: What\xe2\x80\x99s wrong with me, Penny?\nPenny: Nothing, nothing. You know, if we weren\xe2\x80\x99t friends, and you hadn\xe2\x80\x99t brought up that creepy pornography story, I\xe2\x80\x99d be on you like the speed of light squared on matter to make energy.\nRaj: Hey, you totally got that right! E equals M C squared.\nPenny: I listen. I have no idea what it means, but I listen. To friendship.\nRaj: To friendship.\nSheldon (off): Would you booze hounds please stop that infernal clinking? And the answer was elephant!\nScene: Raj\xe2\x80\x99s apartment. Leonard and Priya are kissing.\nLeonard: Mmm. Mmm.\nPriya: Leonard, sweetheart, we\xe2\x80\x99re kissing, not eating hot soup.\nLeonard: Sorry.\nPriya (computer tone): That\xe2\x80\x99s my parents on video chat. Go hide in the bedroom.\nLeonard: Oh, come on! Why don\xe2\x80\x99t we just tell them that we\xe2\x80\x99re dating?\nPriya: Oh, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been through this. It\xe2\x80\x99s not the time.\nLeonard: When is the time?\nPriya: I\xe2\x80\x99ve got five brothers and sisters. One of them is bound to screw up real big, and then I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell my parents about you. Now, shoo.\nLeonard: Fine.\nPriya: Hello, Mummy. Hello, Daddy.\nDr Koothrappali: We heard there was a tornado in Kansas City. Is that close to you?\nPriya: No.\nMrs Koothrappali: Where is your brother?\nPriya: Out with friends.\nDr Koothrappali: I don\xe2\x80\x99t like it, a young girl alone in an apartment.\nMrs Koothrappali: I\xe2\x80\x99ll sleep so much better when you move back here next month.\nLeonard: You\xe2\x80\x99re moving back to India?\nDr Koothrappali: Who\xe2\x80\x99s that?\nMrs Koothrappali: Oh, my God! There\xe2\x80\x99s someone in your apartment. Call the police in America!\nLeonard: When were you going to tell me about this?\nPriya: Oh, hello, Leonard. What a pleasant surprise! Mummy, Daddy, you remember Rajesh\xe2\x80\x99s friend Leonard.\nDr Koothrappali: I thought you said Rajesh was out with his friends.\nPriya: He has many friends.\nDr Koothrappali: Rajesh has many friends?\nMrs Koothrappali: Why are you lying to us?\nLeonard: She\xe2\x80\x99s lying because she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want you to know we\xe2\x80\x99re dating.\nPriya: Leonard!\nLeonard: Well, what difference does it make? If you\xe2\x80\x99re moving back to India, we\xe2\x80\x99re obviously breaking up.\nPriya: You know what? I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to deal with this right now.\nLeonard: So. Hot in India?\nDr Koothrappali: Of course it is. It always is. It\xe2\x80\x99s India. Now, what do you have to say for yourself?\nLeonard: Uh. That is a beautiful tapestry.\nScene: Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom. Raj and Penny are in bed.\nPenny (waking up): Oh, God. Oh, God! Oh. Okay, look. This never happened. Do you understand me? (Raj nods) Really? Still can\xe2\x80\x99t talk to me?\nScene: The living room. Leonard is asleep on the couch.\nSheldon: What are you doing here?\nLeonard: What?\nSheldon: I said, what are you doing here?\nLeonard: I live here.\nSheldon: I have paperwork that says differently.\nLeonard: Priya\xe2\x80\x99s going back to India.\nSheldon: Irrelevant. Rajesh and I have a good thing going and you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to ruin it. (Knock on door) What are you doing here?\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99ve been up all night. I had a fight with Bernadette.\nSheldon: Why?\nHoward: She gave me a beautiful watch.\nSheldon: Leonard, do you understand this?\nLeonard: Yes.\nSheldon: Talk to him.\nPenny (entering room dishevelled, with a half naked Raj behind): Damn.\nLeonard: What\xe2\x80\x99s going on?\nPenny: Oh. It\xe2\x80\x99s, it\xe2\x80\x99s not what it looks like.\nSheldon: What does it look like?\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
