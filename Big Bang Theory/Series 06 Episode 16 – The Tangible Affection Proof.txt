b'Scene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nPenny: You\xe2\x80\x99ll never believe what happened to me at work today.\nLeonard: Hmm?\nPenny: This old guy was choking on his food, and I saved his life.\nLeonard: You\xe2\x80\x99re kidding. Did you Heimlich him?\nPenny: No. I said, oh, my God, I think that old guy\xe2\x80\x99s choking, and then one of the busboys Heimlich\xe2\x80\x99ed him.\nLeonard: You\xe2\x80\x99re a hero.\nPenny: Yeah, that was the point of the story.\nLeonard: Oh, yeah, speaking of work, do you know if you have Thursday night off?\nPenny: Um, I think so. Why?\nLeonard: What do you mean, why? It\xe2\x80\x99s Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s Day.\nPenny: Oh, right. Yeah, we can do something.\nLeonard: You could be a little more into it.\nPenny: No, I\xe2\x80\x99m into it, I\xe2\x80\x99m into it. Just, there\xe2\x80\x99s so much pressure to make the night special, and it never works out.\nLeonard: Okay, well, this time it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be different. Because I am like a romance ninja. You don\xe2\x80\x99t see it coming, and then bam, romance, watch out, hearts, kisses, love, ooh-ya!\nPenny: You know, sometimes I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve made you so much cooler than you used to be, and then you go and do that.\nScene: The stairwell.\nSheldon: So, in conclusion, I believe the painful sensation felt after passing a meal of spicy chillies is proof that the rectum does possess the sense of taste.\nAmy: I concur, but you changed the subject. What are we doing for Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s Day?\nSheldon: Oh, you caught that, did you?\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The comic book store.\nHoward (on phone): Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay! Okay.\nRaj: Everything okay?\nHoward: Bernie\xe2\x80\x99s a little cranky since she\xe2\x80\x99s been working, like, 17 hours a day. And I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a lot on my plate, too, because I\xe2\x80\x99ve been busting my tail playing Assassin\xe2\x80\x99s Creed.\nRaj: Hey, Stuart, you got anything going on for Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s Day?\nStuart: Not really. Other than hiding all the sharp objects around here and white-knuckling it till morning. What do you got going on?\nRaj: Oh, well, I was going to spend the night with my special little lady, but, uh, she got worms, and then I had to take her to the vet.\nStuart: There must be something we can do.\nRaj: Well, uh, how about you keep the store open late, and we throw a party for all the people who don\xe2\x80\x99t have dates?\nStuart That actually sounds kind of nice.\nRaj: Yeah, the theme will be that the greatest love a man can have is the love he has with himself.\nStuart: That\xe2\x80\x99s good. Or maybe something a little less hand in the pants.\nScene: Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s office.\nSheldon: Ah, Alex, excellent. I have a research problem that I believe you can help with.\nAlex: Oh, Dr. Cooper, thank you. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been waiting for an opportunity to contribute to your scientific work.\nSheldon: Oh, no, no. That\xe2\x80\x99s not going to happen, no. What I need you to do is find a Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s gift for my girlfriend.\nAlex: You realize I passed up an opportunity to work at Fermilab to take this job with you.\nSheldon: Well, I guess those chaps will have to have someone else buy their girlfriends presents. Now, here is, let\xe2\x80\x99s see, this is, this is about two thousand dollars, um, I think she likes monkeys and the colour grey. Contribute to my work. Ah, kids say the darnedest things.\nScene: Howard\xe2\x80\x99s lab.\nLeonard: Hey, you coming to lunch?\nHoward: Yeah, one second. Come here. I want to show you something.\nLeonard: What you looking at?\nHoward: Well, I was trying to come up with something really romantic to give Bernadette for Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s Day since she\xe2\x80\x99s been such a pain in the ass.\nLeonard: You can\xe2\x80\x99t find a card that says that?\nHoward: Check it out. I used the atomic force microscope in the material science lab and wrote our initials in a heart one one-thousandth the size of a grain of sand.\nLeonard: Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s cool.\nHoward: A micro-valentine for a microbiologist.\nLeonard: From her micro-husband. That is amazing. How long did this take you?\nHoward: Mmm, about twelve hours. I pulled an all-nighter.\nLeonard: Oh, wow.\nHoward: Yeah, I know, it really took a bite out of my video game time. What are you and Penny doing?\nLeonard: Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to take her to a nice restaurant for dinner.\nHoward: Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s not bad, but as far as romance goes, I think my gift hits it right out of\xe2\x80\xa6 (Bumps into chair and drops the slide)\nLeonard: Want to come to dinner with us?\nHoward: Yes, please.\nScene: The apartment.\nSheldon: Okay. Amy will be here shortly, expecting the perfect Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s gift, so, you\xe2\x80\x99re up kid. Dazzle me. Go.\nAlex: Okay, I think I have some really great choices. I went on Amy\xe2\x80\x99s Facebook page and read up on her interests.\nSheldon: Now, see, I never would have thought to do that. Clearly, I made a good choice farming this out to you. But I am telling you, Amy hit the boyfriend jackpot. Anyway, my socks are on. Let\xe2\x80\x99s knock them off.\nAlex: Well, um, I know she loves playing the harp, so I found this beautiful music box that plays one of her favourite songs.\nSheldon: Now, Amy already has a real harp. And it can play any song. What are you trying to pull here?\nAlex: No, I just thought it would be\xe2\x80\xa6\nSheldon: Next.\nAlex: Okay. Um, I know she\xe2\x80\x99s a fan of The Canterbury Tales.\nSheldon: Mmm.\nAlex: So I found this cool map that illustrates the character\xe2\x80\x99s journey through England. I thought we could put it in a really nice frame.\nSheldon: But she\xe2\x80\x99s got Google Maps on her phone.\nAlex: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how to respond to that.\nSheldon: Well, I hope it\xe2\x80\x99s with a third good option, because these first two, buh.\nAlex: Okay. Well, uh, luckily, I saved the best for last. Since Amy\xe2\x80\x99s a neuroscientist, I did some research and found out that Santiago Ramon y Cajal, the father of modern neuroscience, did lots of hand drawings of brain cells. And I managed to find this signed print.\nSheldon: Wow. Oh, this is truly remarkable.\nAlex: Thank you.\nSheldon: I think I\xe2\x80\x99ll keep it for myself.\nAlex: What about your girlfriend?\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s too late. I call dibs.\nScene: a restaurant.\nPenny: This place is really beautiful.\nLeonard: Waugh, romance ninja.\nPenny: Hey.\nHoward: Sorry we\xe2\x80\x99re late.\nPenny: No problem. We just sat down.\nLeonard: Mmm, would you like some wine?\nBernadette: Yeah, fill her up. I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you when to stop.\nPenny: Is everything okay?\nHoward: Terrific. Couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be better.\nBernadette: Oh, bite me.\nHoward: Look, we can still have a nice night. Just tell me where it is.\nBernadette: Maybe if you did what you said you were going to do, I\xe2\x80\x99d tell you.\nLeonard: Uh, where what is?\nHoward: She hid my Xbox like I\xe2\x80\x99m a child. Yeah, and my mom got me that for my birthday, so if you don\xe2\x80\x99t give it back, I\xe2\x80\x99m telling.\nBernadette: I\xe2\x80\x99ve been working late every night. All I asked was that he clean the apartment and do one load of laundry. But did he do it? No. He just kept on playing that stupid game. You like pushing buttons so much, try pushing them on the washing machine.\nHoward: I said I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.\nBernadette: Sorry doesn\xe2\x80\x99t clean my underpants, buddy.\nHoward: I told you, turn them inside out.\nBernadette: And I told you to bite me.\nLeonard: Trying to have a magical night here, guys.\nPenny: Oh, son of a bitch.\nLeonard: What?\nPenny: Nothing. Nothing.\nLeonard: No, tell me.\nPenny: It\xe2\x80\x99s just this guy I used to date.\nLeonard: Oh.\nPenny: Until he cheated on me with my friend Gretchen, who\xe2\x80\x99s here with him now.\nLeonard: You\xe2\x80\x99re kidding.\nPenny: And it looks like she lost a lot of weight, damn it.\nLeonard: I know it\xe2\x80\x99s not ideal, but don\xe2\x80\x99t let them ruin our night.\nPenny: No, you\xe2\x80\x99re totally right. She could be skinny \xe2\x80\x99cause she\xe2\x80\x99s dying.\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99s the spirit.\nPenny: You know what, screw them. Our night is going to be way more special than theirs.\nLeonard: Yeah.\nBernadette: Uh-oh.\nPenny: What? (Penny\xe2\x80\x99s ex is proposing to Gretchen) Oh, you got to be kidding me.\nGretchen: Oh, my God, yes. Of course I\xe2\x80\x99ll marry you.\nLeonard: Two can play this game. Penny\xe2\x80\xa6\nPenny: Get up.\nLeonard: All right.\nScene: The comic book store.\nRaj: It\xe2\x80\x99s nice that all the people who are lonely on Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s Day can come here tonight and be together.\nStuart: Yeah, I\xe2\x80\x99m really looking forward to it. In fact, there\xe2\x80\x99s no place I would rather be than here.\nRaj: Except on a date with anybody.\nStuart: Literally anybody.\nRaj: You know, you and I have so much fun hanging out. If you were a girl, all our problems would be solved.\nStuart: What?\nRaj: Oh, yeah, think about it. We\xe2\x80\x99d hang out, we\xe2\x80\x99d read comic books, we\xe2\x80\x99d see movies. It\xe2\x80\x99d be like the best relationship ever.\nStuart: That does sound nice.\nRaj: Then I\xe2\x80\x99d take you home, slip off your little black dress and just pile-drive you into oblivion.\nStuart: What?\nScene: The restaurant.\nPenny: Oh, I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe he\xe2\x80\x99s going to marry the girl he cheated on me with.\nLeonard: Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it kind of nice? I mean, he was with the wrong person, and now he found the right person.\nPenny: What, so I\xe2\x80\x99m the wrong person? Maybe you want to be with Gretchen, too.\nBernadette: They do look happy.\nHoward: Yeah, maybe tonight. But a year from now, he\xe2\x80\x99ll be crawling under the sink looking for his Xbox. Well, he will.\nLeonard: You know what? Why don\xe2\x80\x99t we just forget about them and enjoy our Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s Day?\nPenny: Yes, absolutely. Now they\xe2\x80\x99re doing that phony link-arm-drink thingy. I totally taught him that.\nLeonard: I thought we were letting it go.\nPenny: We were; it\xe2\x80\x99s just, it\xe2\x80\x99s not fair, okay? They\xe2\x80\x99re bad people. It\xe2\x80\x99s not supposed to end happy for them, it\xe2\x80\x99s supposed to end happy for me.\nLeonard: Um, it did end happy for you. You\xe2\x80\x99re here with me.\nPenny: Yeah, yeah, I know.\nLeonard: Okay, this is getting a little hard to not take personally.\nPenny: Oh, come on, don\xe2\x80\x99t make this about you.\nLeonard: Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m not. It\xe2\x80\x99s about you.\nPenny: Yeah, well, whatever, okay? I told you, Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s Day sucks.\nLeonard: This one does, and you\xe2\x80\x99re the reason why.\nPenny: What?\nBernadette: You know, compared to them, I\xe2\x80\x99m feeling pretty good about us.\nHoward: Me, too. How about we blow off dessert, go home early, I\xe2\x80\x99ll do that laundry.\nBernadette: Thank you.\nHoward: I love you.\nBernadette: Love you, too.\nHoward: So where\xe2\x80\x99d you hide it?\nBernadette: Where you\xe2\x80\x99d never look.\nHoward: Damn it, it\xe2\x80\x99s in the washing machine.\nScene: The apartment.\nAmy: Hello.\nSheldon: Hello.\nAmy: Happy Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s Day.\nSheldon: Okay. Shall we go to dinner?\nAmy: Hang on. As you know, I had planned a traditional evening of romance and gifts.\nSheldon: Yes, and as you know, I planned to pretend to enjoy it. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been working on this facial expression all day.\nAmy: And I appreciate your effort, but upon contemplation, I decided I was being selfish. So, I cancelled our dinner reservations and came up with an even better way to celebrate Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s Day.\nSheldon: What is that?\nAmy: By doing none of it. No dinner, no romance, no gifts. We stay here, order a pizza and watch one of your beloved Star War Trek things.\nSheldon: Really?\nAmy: Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s what you\xe2\x80\x99d love, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\nSheldon: More than anything.\nAmy: Well, then, that\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99re going to do.\nSheldon: Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to say. This is the most thoughtful gift that anyone\xe2\x80\x99s ever given me. And that\xe2\x80\x99s including an amazing gift that I gave myself earlier today.\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99m your girlfriend. That\xe2\x80\x99s my job. And I know gift-giving puts a lot of pressure on you, so whatever you got me, you can return.\nSheldon: No. No, after everything you didn\xe2\x80\x99t do for me tonight, I want you to have it.\nAmy: What\xe2\x80\x99s this?\nSheldon: Read it.\nAmy: Sheldon Cooper, Caltech University employee information?\nSheldon: At the bottom.\nAmy: In case of emergency, please contact\xe2\x80\xa6 Amy Farrah Fowler. And there\xe2\x80\x99s my phone number. This is the most beautiful gift you could\xe2\x80\x99ve ever given me.\nSheldon: Well, I thought, if I have a stroke or a kidney stone, who would I want to share that with?\nAmy: And you picked me.\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s like you said, you\xe2\x80\x99re my girlfriend.\nAmy: Oh, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Yeah. Okay. Stop ruining Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s Day and order my pizza.\nScene: The stairwell.\nPenny: Night.\nLeonard: Yep. You know what? That was pretty crappy of you. I mean, all I wanted to do was give you a great night, and it\xe2\x80\x99s like you-you went out of your way to destroy it.\nPenny: Yeah, I know. I\xe2\x80\x99m a total bitch.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m not saying that.\nPenny: Well, I am.\nLeonard: Fine, you win. You\xe2\x80\x99re a bitch. Why couldn\xe2\x80\x99t we just have a nice time?\nPenny: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Maybe \xe2\x80\x99cause things are going so well between us lately and I\xe2\x80\x99ve been really happy.\nLeonard: Okay, you\xe2\x80\x99re gonna have to make a lot more sense than that.\nPenny: Obviously, I have some commitment issues.\nLeonard: Glaringly obvious. Go on.\nPenny: As long as things keep going great between us, you\xe2\x80\x99ll keep asking me to marry you, and eventually I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna end up saying yes, and then we\xe2\x80\x99re gonna be married forever, and the whole thing just freaks me out.\nLeonard: Okay. I know I propose a lot. So how about this? I promise I will never ask you to marry me again.\nPenny: What, what do you mean? Are you breaking up with me?\nLeonard: No. No, no, no, no. But if someday you decide you want to get married, you have to propose to me.\nPenny: Really?\nLeonard: Yes. It\xe2\x80\x99s all on you. But I got to tell you, when the time comes, I want the whole nine yards. I want you down on one knee, flowers, I want to be swept off my feet.\nPenny: Yeah, you got it.\nLeonard: And I\xe2\x80\x99m cool with surprises. But nothing on a Jumbotron. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to cry on a big screen like that.\nPenny: Okay. You know what? This might be the wine talking, but I have a very important question to ask you.\nLeonard: You do?\nPenny: Leonard Hofstadter?\nLeonard: Yes?\nPenny: Will you be my valentine?\nLeonard: Sorry. Maybe next year. I\xe2\x80\x99m just kidding. Romance ninja. Let\xe2\x80\x99s have sex. Waugh!\nScene: The comic book store.\nNerdy guy: Thank you, guys, for doing this.\nRaj: We\xe2\x80\x99re glad you could make it.\nNerdy guy: Usually I spend Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s Day sad and alone. This year, I\xe2\x80\x99m just sad.\nRaj: What is it about this holiday that makes people so unhappy?\nStuart: I know. I hate myself most of the time, but tonight\xe2\x80\x99s the night I know everyone else does, too.\nNerdy guy: I think you\xe2\x80\x99re cool.\nStuart: Great.\nRaj: I got to tell you, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got to stop beating ourselves up like this. Excuse me, everybody. Can I have your attention, please? We\xe2\x80\x99re all here tonight because we have no one to be with. But that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make us mutants. The only mutants here are in these comic books. We\xe2\x80\x99ve got to stop defining our self-worth by whether or not we\xe2\x80\x99re in a relationship. You know what I see when I look around? I see a room full of great people. So let\xe2\x80\x99s give ourselves a break. We are a community, and as long as we have each other, we\xe2\x80\x99re never truly alone.\nGirl: That was cool. What you said.\nRaj: You really think so?\nGirl: Yeah, I do.\nRaj: Thank you. Uh, would you like to, uh, get a cup, a cup of coffee or\xe2\x80\xa6?\nGirl: Okay.\nRaj: Later, losers!\nScene: Amy\xe2\x80\x99s lab. Phone rings.\nAmy: Hello? Another medical emergency? What\xe2\x80\x99s wrong with him now? I seriously doubt he was bitten by a Chinese bird spider. How exactly does a bump feel Asian? Just put him on the phone. Sheldon, I am not driving over there again. Because I drove over there yesterday for a brain tumour that turned out to be an ice cream headache. Yes, I still want to be your emergency contact. Yes, you can eat your ice cream too fast and also have a brain tumour. I\xe2\x80\x99m on my way. Brain tumour would explain a lot.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
