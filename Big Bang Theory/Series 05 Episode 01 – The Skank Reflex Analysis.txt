b'Scene: The Cafeteria\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s not what it looks like. It\xe2\x80\x99s not what it looks like.\nLeonard: What are you grinding about?\nSheldon: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s brain teaser this morning. She and Koothrappali emerge from your bedroom. She is dishevelled, and Raj is dressed only in a sheet. The sole clue, it\xe2\x80\x99s not what it looks like.\nLeonard: Just let it go, Sheldon.\nSheldon: If I could, I would, but I can\xe2\x80\x99t, so I shan\xe2\x80\x99t. Now, knowing Penny, the obvious answer is, they engaged in coitus. But, since that\xe2\x80\x99s what it looked like, we can rule that out. Let\xe2\x80\x99s put on our thinking cap, shall we? (Mimes doing so) Raj is from India, a tropical country. Third World hygiene. Parasitic infections are common, such as pinworms. Mm-hmm. The procedure for diagnosing pinworms is to wait until the subject is asleep, and the worms crawl out of the rectum for air. (Leonard spits out food) Yes, just like that. Penny could have been inspecting Raj\xe2\x80\x99s anal region for parasites. Oh, boy. That\xe2\x80\x99s a true blue friend.\nLeonard: They slept together, Sherlock.\nSheldon: No, you weren\xe2\x80\x99t listening. She said, it\xe2\x80\x99s not what it looks like.\nLeonard: She lied.\nSheldon: Oh. Well don\xe2\x80\x99t I look silly sitting here wearing this?\nCredits sequence.\nScene: The Cafeteria\nHoward: Hey.\nRaj: Hey.\nLeonard: Hey.\nSheldon: Hey. Leonard, is it awkward for you knowing that one of your dear friends had sexual intercourse with a woman you used to love in the very place you lay your head?\nLeonard: No, I\xe2\x80\x99m fine with it.\nSheldon: That sounds like sarcasm, but I\xe2\x80\x99m going to disregard it, because I have an agenda. Paintball. Specifically, the interdepartmental tournament this weekend. Now, in order to function better as a fighting unit, I thought we should establish a chain of command. Now, it goes without saying that I would outrank the three of you, but the question remains, by how much? Now, I don\xe2\x80\x99t see me as some four-star general, back at HQ riding a desk and playing golf with the Secretary of Defence. But I also can\xe2\x80\x99t be Sergeant Cooper, because that might lead you to think of me as just a regular Joe. This might take some thought. As you were.\nLeonard: What the hell is wrong with you?\nHoward: Yeah, how could you do that?\nRaj: What is it to you?\nHoward: I got his back.\nRaj: Yeah, right. You\xe2\x80\x99re just jealous because it turns out I\xe2\x80\x99m Penny\xe2\x80\x99s number two choice after Leonard.\nHoward: Hey, if I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t engaged to Bernadette, that totally could have been me.\nLeonard: Please. Sheldon would have been before you, and he might not even have genitals.\nRaj: Why do you care so much? You\xe2\x80\x99re dating my sister, and Penny and I are in love.\nLeonard and Howard together: What?\nSheldon: Gentlemen, if I may interject, I\xe2\x80\x99ve decided my rank will be captain. If it\xe2\x80\x99s good enough for Kirk, Crunch and Kangaroo, it\xe2\x80\x99s good enough for me.\nHoward: You\xe2\x80\x99re not in love with Penny.\nRaj: Yes, I am. The god Kamadeva has shot us with his flowery arrows of love.\nHoward: Who?\nRaj: He\xe2\x80\x99s the Hindu version of Cupid, but way better, because he rides a giant parrot.\nLeonard: Raj, come on. You fall in love with any girl who smiles at you. A month ago, you were writing poems about his fiancee.\nHoward: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. What?\nRaj: Rubbish. He\xe2\x80\x99s talking rubbish.\nLeonard: Oh, Bernadette, please play my clarinet.\nRaj: That could have been about anyone. Besides, you have nothing to worry about, because now I\xe2\x80\x99m the dusky half of Koothrapenny.\nSheldon: For the record, I do have genitals. They\xe2\x80\x99re functional and aesthetically pleasing.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment. Penny has a bottle of wine. She can\xe2\x80\x99t find a glass. Finds a measuring jug and uses that instead. There is a knock on the door.\nPenny: Coming. Yup, that\xe2\x80\x99s good. Wine glasses should have handles.\nAmy: Keeping accurate track of your alcohol intake. Smart idea considering how trampy you get when you\xe2\x80\x99ve had a few.\nPenny: You heard what I did?\nAmy: Well, I heard who you did.\nPenny: Oh, my God, I screwed up everything. I hurt Leonard, I hurt Raj, I mean, what is wrong with me? I feel like two totally different people, Dr. Jekyll and Mrs. Whore.\nAmy: Don\xe2\x80\x99t be so hard on yourself. Do you know the story of Catherine the Great?\nPenny: No.\nAmy: She ruled Russia in the late seventeen hundreds, and one night, when she was feeling particularly randy, she used an intricate system of pulleys to have intimate relations with a horse.\nPenny: I\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\xa6 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. What does this have to do with me?\nAmy: She engaged in interspecies hanky-panky, and people still call her great. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure your reputation can survive you shagging a little Indian boy.\nScene: Raj\xe2\x80\x99s apartment. There is a knock on the door. He opens it.\nBernadette: You jerk face! What did you tell Howard? Did you say there was something going on between us? Because he thinks there is. He\xe2\x80\x99s completely freaking out!\nRaj: Please, come in.\nBernadette: What the hell is wrong with you?\nRaj: Well, you were always so nice to me, I thought maybe you liked me.\nBernadette: I\xe2\x80\x99m nice to everyone.\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.\nBernadette: Damn right, you\xe2\x80\x99re sorry. And you tell Howard there\xe2\x80\x99s never been anything between us.\nRaj: I will. Hey, Bernadette?\nBernadette: What?!\nRaj: Do you think I have a shot with Penny?\nBernadette: Of course you do. You\xe2\x80\x99re a cutie pie. Any girl would be lucky to have you.\nScene: Penny\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nPenny: You know, I\xe2\x80\x99ve done this before. In kindergarten, I was supposed to marry Jason Sorensen at recess, but by the time my class got out there, he was already engaged to Chelsea Himmelfarb. So what did I do? Hung upside down from the monkey bars, let all the boys see my underpants.\nAmy: You can\xe2\x80\x99t blame yourself. When your prefrontal cortex fails to make you happy, promiscuity rewards you with the needed flood of dopamine. We neurobiologists refer to this as the skank reflex.\nPenny: You know what? Let\xe2\x80\x99s get out of here.\nAmy: Where are we going?\nPenny: Somewhere where no one\xe2\x80\x99s seen me naked. We may have to drive awhile. (Opens door. Sees Leonard and Sheldon. Slams it shut again.)\nSheldon: Subtlety isn\xe2\x80\x99t her strong suit, is it?\nPenny: Can I stay at your place for a few nights?\nAmy: Really? A best friend sleepover? Yay.\nPenny: Yeah, sure. Yay!\nAmy: We\xe2\x80\x99ll make popcorn, stay up all night and I\xe2\x80\x99ll teach you my secret language, Op.\nPenny: Sounds great.\nAmy: Nope. Sounds Gop Rop E A Top.\nPenny: Yeah, I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna go pack a bag.\nAmy: No, you\xe2\x80\x99re not. You\xe2\x80\x99re gonna Pop A Cop Kop A Bop A Gop.\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: Do we really have to wear this camouflage crap to play paintball?\nSheldon: Who said that? Leonard, I can hear your voice, but I can\xe2\x80\x99t see you.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m not in the mood, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Oh, there you are. Leonard, I know you\xe2\x80\x99re upset about recent events, and I have someone here to help. (Showing laptop screen)\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to talk to Amy.\nSheldon: No, it\xe2\x80\x99s not Amy.\nDr Hofstadter: Hello, dear.\nLeonard: You called my mother?\nSheldon: Oh, Leonard, is it really necessary to caption the obvious?\nDr Hofstadter: He\xe2\x80\x99s been like that since he was a toddler. Look, Mommy, a butterfly. Maddening.\nLeonard: What\xe2\x80\x99s going on? What do you want?\nDr Hofstadter: Sheldon informed me that you\xe2\x80\x99re experiencing an emotional upheaval, and I\xe2\x80\x99m here to help.\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99s so nice.\nDr Hofstadter: And we\xe2\x80\x99re back to the obvious. Now, what\xe2\x80\x99s up?\nLeonard: Well, uh, okay, um, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get back together with Penny. We tried it, it was crazy, it didn\xe2\x80\x99t work, but I can\xe2\x80\x99t deal with the fact that she slept with my friend Raj. And then I find out that Raj\xe2\x80\x99s sister Priya, who I\xe2\x80\x99ve been going out with for eight months, is moving back to India. So I\xe2\x80\x99m just completely confused and alone.\nDr Hofstadter: I understand.\nLeonard: Got any advice?\nDr Hofstadter: Yes. Buck up.\nLeonard: Excuse me. You\xe2\x80\x99re a world-renowned expert in parenting and child development, and all you\xe2\x80\x99ve got is buck up?\nDr Hofstadter: Sorry. Buck up, sissy pants.\nLeonard: Thanks, Mother. I feel much better.\nDr Hofstadter: If you need any more help from me, my books are available on Amazon. Logging off.\nScene: Amy\xe2\x80\x99s apartment. Amy is brushing Penny\xe2\x80\x99s hair.\nAmy: Ninety-nine, one hundred. It\xe2\x80\x99s like a waterfall of liquid gold. My turn.\nPenny: You know, I don\xe2\x80\x99t even know what the point of me staying in L.A. is. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t gotten a single acting job since I moved out here. The closest I came was last month, I got a callback for a hemorrhoid commercial.\nAmy: Oh, I could so see you being the face of haemorrhoids.\nPenny: I know, right? Maybe I should just move back to Nebraska.\nAmy: No, I can\xe2\x80\x99t let you do that.\nPenny: Why not? (There is a knock on the door)\nAmy: For the first time ever, I have a thriving social life. And no pressure, but it kind of lives and dies with you.\nRaj: Hi, Amy. Can I talk to Penny?\nAmy: A guest in my trundle bed and a boy at my door? I wish I could tell 13-year-old me it does get better.\nPenny: How did you know I was here?\nRaj: It\xe2\x80\x99s all over her Facebook page.\nAmy: I\xe2\x80\x99ll take your stuff to the bedroom and clear out a drawer.\nPenny: Thanks.\nAmy: No problem. Try and keep it in your pants, okay?\nPenny: So, hi. What\xe2\x80\x99s up?\nRaj: I was wondering if you\xe2\x80\x99re free Friday. They\xe2\x80\x99re having a Totally \xe2\x80\x9980s Night at the Greek. Hall & Oates, Katrina and the Waves and three-fifths of Kajagoogoo.\nPenny: Oh. Gee, that\xe2\x80\x99s really sweet, but the thing is\xe2\x80\xa6\nRaj: Aw, there\xe2\x80\x99s a thing.\nPenny: Look, honey, I was really drunk and made a huge mistake last night. We should\xe2\x80\x99ve never slept together. It\xe2\x80\x99s what ruins friendships.\nRaj: You can\xe2\x80\x99t ruin a friendship with sex. That\xe2\x80\x99s like trying to ruin ice cream with chocolate sprinkles.\nPenny: Come here. Just listen to me. I want to go back to the way we were before. You know, friends. No sprinkles.\nRaj: Oh. All right.\nPenny: Thank you.\nRaj: Well, uh, as your friend, you might like to know that, um, we didn\xe2\x80\x99t have sex in the conventional sense.\nPenny: Oh, God. Did you pull some weird Indian crap on me?\nRaj: No, no. After we got undressed and jumped in bed, you, you asked if I had protection.\nPenny: Oh, you did, didn\xe2\x80\x99t you?\nRaj: Of course. I\xe2\x80\x99m always packing. Anyway, um, I had trouble putting it on and you tried to help and, that was all she wrote.\nPenny: So, we didn\xe2\x80\x99t actually\xe2\x80\xa6\nRaj: I did. It was beautiful.\nPenny: Oh!\nRaj: Penny, please, please promise me you won\xe2\x80\x99t tell anybody about this.\nPenny: Of course I won\xe2\x80\x99t. No, I won\xe2\x80\x99t.\nRaj: Oh, good. Um, can I tell people that our love burned too bright and too quickly? Kind of a Candle in the Wind deal?\nPenny: Sure.\nRaj: Cool. Can I say it fell apart because you were all, I want to have your babies, and I was like, I\xe2\x80\x99m too rock and roll to be tied down?\nPenny: No.\nRaj: Can I say I ruined you for white men?\nPenny: Also no.\nRaj: Okay, just the candle thing.\nPenny: Yeah.\nRaj: Cool. All right friend.\nPenny: Hmm.\nRaj: I\xe2\x80\x99ll see you around.\nPenny: Okay. Raj, wait. Thank you for being my friend. (She hugs him.)\nRaj: Penny?\nPenny: Mm-hmm?\nRaj: It\xe2\x80\x99s getting beautiful again.\nScene: A shed on the paintball range.\nSheldon: All right, this is a Google Earth view of the field of battle.\nHoward: I don\xe2\x80\x99t see anything.\nSheldon: Give it a second to load. Whenever you\xe2\x80\x99re ready, AT&T! Okay, here we go. This is us here. To the south is Professor Loomis and the Geology Department. According to their Twitter feed, they\xe2\x80\x99re out of sunblock, which means they\xe2\x80\x99ll have to hug the tree line or risk melanoma. That\xe2\x80\x99s our edge. All we have to do is move quickly over this ridge, the rock-worshipping pasty-faced bastards won\xe2\x80\x99t know what hit them. All right, let\xe2\x80\x99s move out.\nLeonard: Hang on, Sheldon. How could you not tell me your sister was moving back to India?\nHoward: Maybe he was too busy writing clumsy penis metaphors about my fiancee.\nRaj: Screw you. That was a beautifully written penis metaphor.\nLeonard: You know what, guys, I\xe2\x80\x99m not in the mood for paintball. What do you say we just bag it?\nHoward: Fine with me.\nRaj: Sure, whatever.\nSheldon: You can\xe2\x80\x99t quit. That\xe2\x80\x99s a court-martial offence. That\xe2\x80\x99s punishable by\xe2\x80\xa6 You can\xe2\x80\x99t quit.\nLeonard: Sorry, Sheldon, it\xe2\x80\x99s just not a good time for playing games.\nSheldon: This is a game to you? Uh, was the Battle of Antietam a game? Huh? Was the sack of Rome a game?\nLeonard: Yes, no and no.\nSheldon: Wait. I just want you all to know that I forgive you. This mutiny isn\xe2\x80\x99t your fault, it\xe2\x80\x99s mine. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t earned these bars. Although what I lack in leadership, apparently I more than make up for in sewing.\nHoward: Let it go, Sheldon. I\xe2\x80\x99ll get you a Jamba Juice on the way home.\nSheldon: No. Jamba Juice is for heroes. And that\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be.\nLeonard: What are you doing?\nSheldon: Following in the footsteps of Kirk, Crunch and Kangaroo. (Walks outside) Geology isn\xe2\x80\x99t a real science! (Gets hit by countless paintball pellets)\nHoward: Damn those sons of bitches!\nLeonard: Let\xe2\x80\x99s get \xe2\x80\x99em!\nSheldon: If there\xe2\x80\x99s ever a Church of Sheldon, this will be when it started. Ow!\nScene: The apartment.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99d like to propose a toast to the man whose noble sacrifice inspired our victory, Captain Sheldon Cooper.\nHoward and Raj: Here, here.\nSheldon: Excuse me. It\xe2\x80\x99s Major Sheldon Cooper. With my last breath, I awarded myself a battlefield promotion. It\xe2\x80\x99s kind of a big deal.\nPenny: Hi. You guys have a minute?\nLeonard: Uh, yeah, sure.\nPenny: Okay. Um. Well, I already talked to Raj, but I wanted to apologize to the rest of you for, you know, everything.\nRaj: Please, Penny, let me. We\xe2\x80\x99ve decided to let our crazy, wonderful night together be just one of those memories you have and can call to mind when you\xe2\x80\x99re feeling blue or you\xe2\x80\x99re in the shower.\nPenny: Hey, what you doing, Quick Draw?\nRaj: Sorry. Go on.\nPenny: Anyways, I wanted you guys all to know that I\xe2\x80\x99ve been taking a really hard look at things and come to the conclusion I have to stop kidding myself. I suck at acting. It\xe2\x80\x99s time for me to move back to Nebraska.\nLeonard: You\xe2\x80\x99re leaving?\nPenny: Yeah.\nHoward: What are you going to do in Nebraska?\nPenny: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, maybe teach acting. (Phone rings) Oh, sorry. Hold on. Hello?\nLeonard: Penny, Penny, listen, I hope you\xe2\x80\x99re not doing this \xe2\x80\x99cause of you and me, because I have a girlfriend, and you\xe2\x80\x99re a single woman.\nPenny: Shh! It\xe2\x80\x99s my agent, it\xe2\x80\x99s my agent. You\xe2\x80\x99re kidding. Oh, my gosh. I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe it! Really? Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m so excited, thank you, thank you so much. Okay, bye. I got the haemorrhoid commercial! I start Monday.\nSheldon: What about Nebraska?\nPenny: Oh, hell with Nebraska. I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna be a star!\nSheldon (to Leonard): Have you ever thought of teaching physics?\nScene: The apartment. Penny\xe2\x80\x99s ad is on the television. She is at a stables.\nActress: Ready to ride?\nPenny (on screen): I don\xe2\x80\x99t think so, Mom. Not today.\nActress: Oh, sweetie. Haemorrhoids acting up again?\nPenny (on screen): You don\xe2\x80\x99t know the half of it.\nActress: Oh, yes, I do. Try a dab of this.\nPenny (on screen): Rose-scented Preparation-H for women?\nActress: Now, the H is for Her.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m proud of you.\nPenny: Shh! Here comes my joke.\nActress: How are you doing?\nPenny (on screen): Sittin\xe2\x80\x99 pretty.\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
