In the summer it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s directly in the path of a cross breeze created by open windows there, and there. It faces the television at an angle that is neither direct, thus discouraging conversation, nor so far wide to create a parallax distortion, I could go on, but I think I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve made my point.\\nPenny: Do you want me to move?\\nSheldon: Well.\\nLeonard: Just sit somewhere else.\\nSheldon: Fine.
