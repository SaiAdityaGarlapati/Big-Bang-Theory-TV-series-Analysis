b'Scene: A corridor at a sperm bank.\nSheldon: So if a photon is directed through a plane with two slits in it and either slit is observed it will not go through both slits. If it\xe2\x80\x99s unobserved it will, however, if it\xe2\x80\x99s observed after it\xe2\x80\x99s left the plane but before it hits its target, it will not have gone through both slits.\nLeonard: Agreed, what\xe2\x80\x99s your point?\nSheldon: There\xe2\x80\x99s no point, I just think it\xe2\x80\x99s a good idea for a tee-shirt.\nLeonard: Excuse me?\nReceptionist: Hang on.\nLeonard: One across is Aegean, eight down is Nabakov, twenty-six across is MCM, fourteen down is\xe2\x80\xa6 move your finger\xe2\x80\xa6 phylum, which makes fourteen across Port-au-Prince. See, Papa Doc\xe2\x80\x99s capital idea, that\xe2\x80\x99s Port-au-Prince. Haiti.\nReceptionist: Can I help you?\nLeonard: Yes. Um, is this the High IQ sperm bank?\nReceptionist: If you have to ask, maybe you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be here.\nSheldon: I think this is the place.\nReceptionist: Fill these out.\nLeonard: Thank-you. We\xe2\x80\x99ll be right back.\nReceptionist: Oh, take your time. I\xe2\x80\x99ll just finish my crossword puzzle. Oh wait.\n(They sit and begin to fill in forms).\nSheldon: Leonard, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I can do this.\nLeonard: What, are you kidding? You\xe2\x80\x99re a semi-pro.\nSheldon: No. We are committing genetic fraud. There\xe2\x80\x99s no guarantee that our sperm is going to generate high IQ offspring, think about that. I have a sister with the same basic DNA mix who hostesses at Fuddruckers.\nLeonard: Sheldon, this was your idea. A little extra money to get fractional T1 bandwidth in the apartment.\nSheldon: I know, and I do yearn for faster downloads, but there\xe2\x80\x99s some poor woman is going to pin her hopes on my sperm, what if she winds up with a toddler who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know if he should use an integral or a differential to solve the area under a curve.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m sure she\xe2\x80\x99ll still love him.\nSheldon: I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t.\nLeonard: Well, what do you want to do?\nSheldon: I want to leave.\nLeonard: Okay.\nSheldon: What\xe2\x80\x99s the protocol for leaving?\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, I\xe2\x80\x99ve never reneged on a proffer of sperm before.\nSheldon: Let\xe2\x80\x99s try just walking out.\nLeonard: Okay.\n\nReceptionist: Bye.\nSheldon: Bye-bye\nLeonard: See you.\nScene: The stairs of the apartment building.\nSheldon: Are you still mad about the sperm bank?\nLeonard: No.\nSheldon: You want to hear an interesting thing about stairs?\nLeonard: Not really.\nSheldon: If the height of a single step is off by as little as two millimetres, most people will trip.\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t care. Two millimetres? That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem right.\nSheldon: No, it\xe2\x80\x99s true, I did a series of experiments when I was twelve, my father broke his clavicle.\nLeonard: Is that why they sent you to boarding school?\nSheldon: No, that was the result of my work with lasers.\nLeonard: New neighbour?\nSheldon: Evidently.\nLeonard: Significant improvement over the old neighbour.\nSheldon: Two hundred pound transvestite with a skin condition, yes she is.\nPenny: Oh, hi!\nLeonard: Hi.\nSheldon: Hi.\nLeonard: Hi.\nSheldon: Hi.\nPenny: Hi?\nLeonard: We don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to interrupt, we live across the hall.\nPenny: Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s nice.\nLeonard: Oh\xe2\x80\xa6 uh\xe2\x80\xa6 no\xe2\x80\xa6 we don\xe2\x80\x99t live together\xe2\x80\xa6 um\xe2\x80\xa6 we live together but in separate, heterosexual bedrooms.\nPenny: Oh, okay, well, guess I\xe2\x80\x99m your new neighbour, Penny.\nLeonard: Leonard, Sheldon.\nPenny: Hi.\nLeonard: Hi.\nSheldon: Hi.\nPenny: Hi.\nLeonard: Hi. Well, uh, oh, welcome to the building.\nPenny: Thankyou, maybe we can have coffee sometime.\nLeonard: Oh, great.\nPenny: Great.\nSheldon: Great.\nLeonard: Great. Well, bye.\nPenny: Bye.\nSheldon: Bye.\nLeonard: Bye.\nLeonard: Should we have invited her for lunch?\nSheldon: No. We\xe2\x80\x99re going to start Season Two of Battlestar Galactica.\nLeonard: We already watched the Season Two DVDs.\nSheldon: Not with commentary.\nLeonard: I think we should be good neighbours, invite her over, make her feel welcome.\nSheldon: We never invited Louis-slash-Louise over.\nLeonard: Well, then that was wrong of us. We need to widen our circle.\nSheldon: I have a very wide circle. I have 212 friends on myspace.\nLeonard: Yes, and you\xe2\x80\x99ve never met one of them.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s the beauty of it.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m going to invite her over. We\xe2\x80\x99ll have a nice meal and chat.\nSheldon: Chat? We don\xe2\x80\x99t chat. At least not offline.\nLeonard: Well it\xe2\x80\x99s not difficult, you just listen to what she says and then you say something appropriate in response.\nSheldon: To what end?\nLeonard: Hi. Again.\nPenny: Hi.\nSheldon: Hi.\nLeonard: Hi.\nPenny: Hi.\nLeonard: Anyway, um. We brought home Indian food. And, um. I know that moving can be stressful, and I find that when I\xe2\x80\x99m undergoing stress, that good food and company can have a comforting effect. Also, curry is a natural laxative, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t have to tell you that, uh, a clean colon is just one less thing to worry about.\nSheldon: Leonard, I\xe2\x80\x99m not expert here but I believe in the context of a luncheon invitation, you might want to skip the reference to bowel movements.\nPenny: Oh, you\xe2\x80\x99re inviting me over to eat?\nLeonard: Uh, yes.\nPenny: Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s so nice, I\xe2\x80\x99d love to.\nLeonard: Great.\nPenny: So, what do you guys do for fun around here?\nSheldon: Well, today we tried masturbating for money.\nCredits sequence.\nScene: Sheldon and Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nLeonard: Okay, well, make yourself at home.\nPenny: Okay, thankyou.\nLeonard: You\xe2\x80\x99re very welcome.\nPenny: This looks like some serious stuff, Leonard, did you do this?\nSheldon: Actually that\xe2\x80\x99s my work.\nPenny: Wow.\nSheldon: Yeah, well, it\xe2\x80\x99s just some quantum mechanics, with a little string theory doodling around the edges. That part there, that\xe2\x80\x99s just a joke, it\xe2\x80\x99s a spoof of the Bourne-Oppenheimer approximation.\nPenny: So you\xe2\x80\x99re like, one of those, beautiful mind genius guys.\nSheldon: Yeah.\nPenny: This is really impressive.\nLeonard: I have a board. If you like boards, this is my board.\nPenny: Holy smokes.\nSheldon: If by holy smokes you mean a derivative restatement of the kind of stuff you can find scribbled on the wall of any men\xe2\x80\x99s room at MIT, sure.\nLeonard: What?\nSheldon: Oh, come on. Who hasn\xe2\x80\x99t seen this differential below \xe2\x80\x9chere I sit broken hearted?\xe2\x80\x9d\nLeonard: At least I didn\xe2\x80\x99t have to invent twenty-six dimensions just to make the math come out.\nSheldon: I didn\xe2\x80\x99t invent them, they\xe2\x80\x99re there.\nLeonard: In what universe?\nSheldon: In all of them, that is the point.\nPenny: Uh, do you guys mind if I start?\nSheldon: Um, Penny, that\xe2\x80\x99s where I sit.\nPenny: So, sit next to me.\nSheldon: No, I sit there.\nPenny: What\xe2\x80\x99s the difference?\nSheldon: What\xe2\x80\x99s the difference?\nLeonard: Here we go.\nSheldon: In the winter that seat is close enough to the radiator to remain warm, and yet not so close as to cause perspiration. In the summer it\xe2\x80\x99s directly in the path of a cross breeze created by open windows there, and there. It faces the television at an angle that is neither direct, thus discouraging conversation, nor so far wide to create a parallax distortion, I could go on, but I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve made my point.\nPenny: Do you want me to move?\nSheldon: Well.\nLeonard: Just sit somewhere else.\nSheldon: Fine. (Wanders in circles, looking lost.)\nLeonard: Sheldon, sit!\nSheldon: Aaah!\nLeonard: Well this is nice. We don\xe2\x80\x99t have a lot of company over.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s not true. Koothrapali and Wolowitz come over all the time.\nLeonard: Yes I now, but\xe2\x80\xa6\nSheldon: Tuesday night we played Klingon boggle until one in the morning.\nLeonard: Yes, I remember.\nSheldon: I resent you saying we don\xe2\x80\x99t have company.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.\nSheldon: That is an antisocial implication.\nLeonard: I said I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.\nPenny: So, Klingon boggle?\nLeonard: Yeah, it\xe2\x80\x99s like regular boggle but, in Klingon. That\xe2\x80\x99s probably enough about us, tell us about you.\nPenny: Um, me, okay, I\xe2\x80\x99m Sagittarius, which probably tells you way more than you need to know.\nSheldon: Yes, it tells us that you participate in the mass cultural delusion that the Sun\xe2\x80\x99s apparent position relative to arbitrarily defined constellations and the time of your birth somehow effects your personality.\nPenny: Participate in the what?\nLeonard: I think what Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s trying to say, is that Sagittarius wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been our first guess.\nPenny: Oh, yeah, a lot of people think I\xe2\x80\x99m a water sign. Okay, let\xe2\x80\x99s see, what else, oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m a vegetarian, oh, except for fish, and the occasional steak, I love steak.\nSheldon: That\xe2\x80\x99s interesting. Leonard can\xe2\x80\x99t process corn.\nLeonard: Wu-uh, do you have some sort of a job?\nPenny: Oh, yeah, I\xe2\x80\x99m a waitress at the Cheesecake Factory.\nLeonard: Oh, okay. I love cheesecake.\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re lactose intolerant.\nLeonard: I don\xe2\x80\x99t eat it, I just think it\xe2\x80\x99s a good idea.\nPenny: Oh, anyways, I\xe2\x80\x99m also writing a screenplay. It\xe2\x80\x99s about this sensitive girl who comes to L.A. from Lincoln Nebraska to be an actress, and winds up a waitress at the Cheesecake Factory.\nLeonard: So it\xe2\x80\x99s based on your life?\nPenny: No, I\xe2\x80\x99m from Omaha.\nLeonard: Well, if that was a movie I would go see it.\nPenny: I know, right? Okay, let\xe2\x80\x99s see, what else? Um, that\xe2\x80\x99s about it. That\xe2\x80\x99s the story of Penny.\nLeonard: Well it sounds wonderful.\nPenny: It was. Until I fell in love with a jerk.\nSheldon (mouths): What\xe2\x80\x99s happening.\nLeonard (mouths back): I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\nPenny: Oh God, you know, four years I lived with him, four years, that\xe2\x80\x99s like as long as High School.\nSheldon: It took you four years to get through High School?\nLeonard: Don\xe2\x80\x99t.\nPenny: I just, I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe I trusted him.\nLeonard: Should I say something? I feel like I should say something.\nSheldon: You? No, you\xe2\x80\x99ll only make it worse.\nPenny: You want to know the most pathetic part? Even though I hate his lying, cheating guts, I still love him. Is that crazy?\nSheldon: Yes.\nLeonard: No, it\xe2\x80\x99s not crazy it\xe2\x80\x99s, uh, uh, it\xe2\x80\x99s a paradox. And paradoxes are part of nature, think about light. Now if you look at Huygens, light is a wave, as confirmed by the double slit experiments, but then, along comes Albert Einstein and discovers that light behaves like particles too. Well, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t make it worse.\nPenny: Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m so sorry, I\xe2\x80\x99m such a mess, and on top of everything else I\xe2\x80\x99m all gross from moving and my stupid shower doesn\xe2\x80\x99t even work.\nLeonard: Our shower works.\nPenny: Really? Would it be totally weird if I used it?\nSheldon: Yes.\nLeonard: No.\nSheldon: No?\nLeonard: No.\nSheldon: No.\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s right down the hall.\nPenny: Thanks. You guys are really sweet.\nSheldon: Well this is an interesting development.\nLeonard: How so?\nSheldon: It has been some time since we\xe2\x80\x99ve had a woman take her clothes off in our apartment.\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99s not true, remember at Thanksgiving my grandmother with Alzheimer\xe2\x80\x99s had that episode.\nSheldon: Point taken. It has been some time since we\xe2\x80\x99ve had a woman take her clothes off after which we didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to rip our eyes out.\nLeonard: The worst part was watching her carve that turkey.\nSheldon: So, what exactly are you trying to accomplish here?\nLeonard: Excuse me?\nSheldon: That woman in there\xe2\x80\x99s not going to have sex with you.\nLeonard: Well I\xe2\x80\x99m not trying to have sex with her.\nSheldon: Oh, good. Then you won\xe2\x80\x99t be disappointed.\nLeonard: What makes you think she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have sex with me, I\xe2\x80\x99m a male and she\xe2\x80\x99s a female?\nSheldon: Yes, but not of the same species.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to engage in hypotheticals here, I\xe2\x80\x99m just trying to be a good neighbour.\nSheldon: Oh, of course.\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99s not to say that if a carnal relationship were to develop that I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t participate. However briefly.\nSheldon: Do you think this possibility will be helped or hindered when she discovers your Luke Skywalker no-more-tears shampoo?\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s Darth Vader shampoo. (There is a knock on the door.) Luke Skywalker\xe2\x80\x99s the conditioner.\nHoward: Wait till you see this.\nRaj: It\xe2\x80\x99s fantastic. Unbelievable.\nLeonard: See what?\nHoward: It\xe2\x80\x99s a Stephen Hawking lecture from MIT in 1974.\nLeonard: This is not a good time.\nHoward: It\xe2\x80\x99s before he became a creepy computer voice:.\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99s great, you guys have to go.\nRaj: Why?\nLeonard: It\xe2\x80\x99s just not a good time.\nSheldon: Leonard has a lady over.\nHoward: Yeah, right, your grandmother back in town?\nLeonard: No. And she\xe2\x80\x99s not a lady, she\xe2\x80\x99s just a new neighbour.\nHoward: Hang on, there really is a lady here?\nLeonard: Uh-huh.\nHoward: And you want us out because you\xe2\x80\x99re anticipating coitus?\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m not anticipating coitus.\nHoward: So she\xe2\x80\x99s available for coitus?\nLeonard: Can we please stop saying coitus?\nSheldon: Technically that would be coitus interruptus.\nPenny: Hey, is there a trick to getting it to switch from tub to shower. Oh. Hi, sorry. Hello!\nHoward: Enchante Madamoiselle. Howard Wolowitz, Cal-Tech department of Applied Physics. You may be familiar with some of my work, it\xe2\x80\x99s currently orbiting Jupiter\xe2\x80\x99s largest moon taking high-resolution digital photographs.\nPenny: Penny. I work at the Cheesecake Factory.\nLeonard: Come on, I\xe2\x80\x99ll show you the trick with the shower.\nHoward: Bon douche.\nPenny: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry?\nHoward: It\xe2\x80\x99s French for good shower. It\xe2\x80\x99s a sentiment I can express in six languages.\nLeonard: Save it for your blog, Howard.\nHoward: See-ka-tong-guay-jow.\nScene: In the bathroom.\nLeonard: Uh, there it goes, it sticks, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.\nPenny: Okay. Thanks.\nLeonard: You\xe2\x80\x99re welcome, oh, you\xe2\x80\x99re going to step right, okay, I\xe2\x80\x99ll\xe2\x80\xa6.\nPenny: Hey, Leonard?\nLeonard: The hair products are Sheldon\xe2\x80\x99s.\nPenny: Um, okay. Can I ask you a favour.\nLeonard: A favour? Sure, you can ask me a favour, I would do you a favour for you.\nPenny: It\xe2\x80\x99s okay if you say no.\nLeonard: Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99ll probably say yes.\nPenny: It\xe2\x80\x99s just not the kind of thing you ask a guy you\xe2\x80\x99ve just met.\nLeonard: Wow.\nScene: Leonard and Sheldon, Inside Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s car\nSheldon: I really think we should examine the chain of causality here.\nLeonard: Must we?\nSheldon: Event A. A beautiful woman stands naked in our shower. Event B. We drive half way across town to retrieve a television set from the aforementioned woman\xe2\x80\x99s ex-boyfriend. Query, on what plane of existence is there even a semi-rational link between these events?\nLeonard: She asked me to do her a favour, Sheldon.\nSheldon: Ah, yes, well that may be the proximal cause of our journey, but we both know it only exists in contradistinction to the higher level distal cause.\nLeonard: Which is?\nSheldon: You think with your penis.\nLeonard: That\xe2\x80\x99s a biological impossibility and you didn\xe2\x80\x99t have to come.\nSheldon: Oh, right, yes, I could have stayed behind and watched Wolowitz try to hit on Penny in Russian, Arabic and Farsi. Why can\xe2\x80\x99t she get her own TV.\nLeonard: Come on, you know how it is with break-ups.\nSheldon: No I don\xe2\x80\x99t. And neither do you.\nLeonard: Wuh, I, I broke up with Joyce Kim.\nSheldon: You did not break up with Joyce Kim, she defected to North Korea.\nLeonard: To mend her broken heart. This situation is much less complicated. There\xe2\x80\x99s some kind of dispute between Penny and her ex-boyfriend as to who gets custody of the TV. She just wanted to avoid having a scene with him.\nSheldon: So we get to have a scene with him?\nLeonard: No, Sheldon, there\xe2\x80\x99s not going to be a scene. There\xe2\x80\x99s two of us and one of him.\nSheldon: Leonard, the two of us can\xe2\x80\x99t even carry a TV.\nScene: Back at the apartment.\nPenny (to Raj): So, you guys work with Leonard and Sheldon at the University?\n(Raj looks at her, looks back at his food, takes a mouthful).\nPenny: Uh, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, do you speak English?\nHoward: Oh, he speaks English, he just can\xe2\x80\x99t speak to women.\nPenny: Really, why?\nHoward: He\xe2\x80\x99s kind of a nerd. Juice box?\nScene: Outside Penny\xe2\x80\x99s old apartment building.\nLeonard (pushes buzzer): I\xe2\x80\x99ll do the talking.\nVoice from buzzer: Yeah.\nLeonard: Hi, I\xe2\x80\x99m Leonard, this is Sheldon.\nSheldon: Hello.\nLeonard: What did I just\xe2\x80\xa6. Uh, we\xe2\x80\x99re here to pick up Penny\xe2\x80\x99s TV.\nVoice: Get lost.\nSheldon: Okay, thanks for your time.\nLeonard: We\xe2\x80\x99re not going to give up just like that.\nSheldon: Leonard, the TV is in the building, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been denied access to the building, ergo we are done.\nLeonard: Excuse me, if I were to give up at the first little hitch I never would have been able to identify the fingerprints of string theory in the aftermath of the big bang.\nSheldon: My apologies. What\xe2\x80\x99s your plan.\n(Leonard starts rattling the doors violently.)\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s just a privilege to watch your mind at work.\nLeonard: Come on, we have a combined IQ of 360, we should be able to figure out how to get into a stupid building.\n(Two girl scouts arrive carrying bags of cookies. One runs her hand down the intercom, pushing all the buttons. The door is buzzed open.)\nSheldon: What do you think their combined IQ is?\nLeonard: Just grab the door.\nScene: Outside Penny\xe2\x80\x99s ex-boyfriend\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nLeonard: This is it. (Knocks.) I\xe2\x80\x99ll do the talking.\nSheldon: Good thinking, I\xe2\x80\x99ll just be the muscle.\nEnormous man: Yeah?\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m Leonard, this is Sheldon.\nSheldon: From the intercom.\nMan: How the hell did you get in the building?\nLeonard: Oh. We\xe2\x80\x99re scientists.\nSheldon: Tell him about our IQ.\nScene: Outside the apartment building. Leonard and Sheldon exit. They are not wearing trousers.\nSheldon: Leonard.\nLeonard: What?\nSheldon: My mom bought me those pants.\nLeonard: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.\nSheldon: You\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to call her.\nScene: On the stairs of Sheldon and Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s building.\nLeonard: Sheldon, I\xe2\x80\x99m so sorry I dragged you through this.\nSheldon: It\xe2\x80\x99s okay. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t my first pantsing, and it won\xe2\x80\x99t be my last.\nLeonard: And you were right about my motives, I was hoping to establish a relationship with Penny that might have some day led to sex.\nSheldon: Well you got me out of my pants.\nLeonard: Anyway, I\xe2\x80\x99ve learned my lesson. She\xe2\x80\x99s out of my league, I\xe2\x80\x99m done with her, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got my work, one day I\xe2\x80\x99ll win the Nobel Prize and then I\xe2\x80\x99ll die alone.\nSheldon: Don\xe2\x80\x99t think like that, you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to die alone.\nLeonard: Thank you Sheldon, you\xe2\x80\x99re a good friend.\nSheldon: And you\xe2\x80\x99re certainly not going to win a Nobel Prize.\nScene: Inside Sheldon and Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\nHoward: This is one of my favourite places to kick back after a quest, they have a great house ale.\nPenny: Wow, cool tiger.\nHoward: Yeah, I\xe2\x80\x99ve had him since level ten. His name is Buttons. Anyway, if you had your own game character we could hang out, maybe go on a quest.\nPenny: Uh, sounds interesting.\nHoward: So you\xe2\x80\x99ll think about it?\nPenny: Oh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to stop thinking about it.\nRaj: Smooth.\nLeonard: We\xe2\x80\x99re home.\nPenny: Oh, my God, what happened?\nLeonard: Well, your ex-boyfriend sends his regards and I think the rest is fairly self-explanatory.\nPenny: I\xe2\x80\x99m so sorry, I really thought if you guys went instead of me he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be such an ass.\nLeonard: No, it was a valid hypothesis.\nSheldon: That was a valid hypothesis? What is happening to you?\nPenny: Really, thank you so much for going and trying you\xe2\x80\x99re, uh, you\xe2\x80\x99re so terrific. Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you put some clothes on, I\xe2\x80\x99ll get my purse and dinner is on me, okay?\nLeonard: Really? Great.\nSheldon: Thank you. You\xe2\x80\x99re not done with her, are you?\nLeonard: Our babies will be smart and beautiful.\nSheldon: Not to mention imaginary.\nScene: All five in Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s car.\nLeonard: Is Thai food okay with you Penny?\nPenny: Sure.\nSheldon: We can\xe2\x80\x99t have Thai food, we had Indian for lunch.\nPenny: So?\nSheldon: They\xe2\x80\x99re both curry based cuisines.\nPenny: So?\nSheldon: They would be gastronomically redundant. I can see we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to spell out everything for this girl.\nPenny: Any ideas Raj? (He just looks at her with a worried expression.)\nHoward: Turn left on Lake Street and head up to Colorado. I know a wonderful little sushi bar that has karaoke.\nPenny: That sounds like fun.\nHoward (sings): Baby, baby don\xe2\x80\x99t get hooked on me. Uh, baby, baby don\xe2\x80\x99t get hooked on me.\nSheldon: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what your odds are in the world as a whole, but as far as the population of this car goes, you\xe2\x80\x99re a veritable Mack Daddy.\nWritten by Chuck Lorre and Bill Prady\nAdvertisements\nLoading...'
